      "3. **Working hours**: Employees have the right to a maximum of 48 hours of work per week (averaged over 17 weeks) under the Working Time Regulations (NI).\n",
      "4. **Paid annual leave**: Employees are entitled to paid annual leave of at least 20 days (or 28 days if part-time workers), with some exceptions.\n",
      "5. **Protection from unfair dismissal**: Employees have protection against unfair dismissal after two years' service.\n",
      "6. **Trade unions and collective bargaining**: Trade unions have the right to negotiate collective agreements, and employees can join or decline membership without repercussions.\n",

      "If you cause a car accident in Wales that results in damage to property (e.g., someone's home) and personal injury, you could face significant consequences. In this scenario, section 2 of the Road Traffic Act applies, which implies that liability under this section may be limited or excluded by a term of an insurance policy. However, liability cannot be limited or excluded if it involves personal injury.\n",
      "\n",
      "The amount of liability for property damage is limited to the amount specified in section 145(4)(b) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (approximately £86,000 as of now).\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding penalties, you might incur fines or imprisonment depending on the severity of the accident and your culpability. Under Section 3, if an automated vehicle was involved, you could be liable for damages if you were in charge of it at the time of the accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, according to section 2 (7), the imposition by this Act of liability in respect of an accident caused by a motor vehicle does not affect any right of a person to recover compensation from any other person in respect of that accident. This implies that while you might face penalties or be held liable for damages under the Road Traffic Act, your insurance company could potentially cover these costs if you have adequate coverage.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of actual penalties, it's worth noting that this information is not provided within the given text snippet. The text only outlines sections and regulations related to road traffic in Wales but does not specify specific fines or imprisonment periods for property damage and personal injury resulting from a car accident. You should consult relevant authorities or legal experts for the most accurate and up-to-date information on penalties applicable in such cases.\n",

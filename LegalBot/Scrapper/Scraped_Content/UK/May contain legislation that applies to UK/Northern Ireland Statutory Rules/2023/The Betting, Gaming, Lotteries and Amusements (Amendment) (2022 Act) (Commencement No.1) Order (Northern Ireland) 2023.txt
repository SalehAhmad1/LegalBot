(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is the first commencement order made under the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and Amusements (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (“the 2022 Act”). The Order brings into operation certain provisions of the 2022 Act which make amendments to the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and Amusements (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 (“the 1985 Order”).
The Order appoints 1st October 2023 as the day for the coming into operation of section 7 of the 2022 Act which inserts Article 124A into the 1985 Order. This creates a new offence of inviting, causing or permitting a person under the age of 18 to play a gaming machine other than a lower limit gaming machine.
This Order also appoints 1st October 2023 as the day for the coming into operation of section 13 of the 2022 Act which inserts a new Article 169 into the 1985 Order. This provision deals with the offence of cheating.
Finally, this Order appoints 1st October 2023 as the day for the coming into operation of section 16 of the 2022 Act, which inserts Article 180A into the 1985 Order. This provides that the Department must issue one or more Codes of Practice about the manner in which facilities for gambling are provided. Section 16(2) also makes consequential amendments to the 1985 Order.

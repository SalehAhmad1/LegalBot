Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs publishes a charging scheme to ensure that as far as practical, fees and charges payable for waste management licenses under the Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 (the 1997 Order) are sufficient to recover costs for the Department in exercising its functions under the 1997 Order. However, charges for processing applications for registration as carriers, brokers or dealers in controlled waste are required to be set out in legislation. The purpose of these Regulations is to increase those charges to reflect changes in the value of money. Details of the increased fees will also be included in the charging scheme which sets out the fees and charges payable in respect to waste management licenses.
These Regulations amend the regulation 4 of the Controlled Waste (Registration of Carriers and Seizure of Vehicles) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999, which sets out the process concerning applications for registration as a carrier of controlled waste, including the associated fees.
Also amended is paragraph 3(10) of Schedule 4 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003, which sets out fees in relation to the registration of brokers and dealers in controlled waste.

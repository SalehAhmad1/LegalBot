(9) Where the Board estimates the person’s pensionable pay under paragraph (7) and does not hold records of that person’s rank, and the person cannot provide the Board with documents to assist them to determine the person’s rank, the Board may assume that the person held the rank of firefighter for the purposes of estimating pensionable pay.

(14) Where a person did not receive a notification from the Board under article 65B(8) of this Part, despite the Board using reasonable endeavours to notify eligible persons as required by that paragraph, an election under paragraph (1) may take effect after 30th April 2025.”.

“Purchase of service during the extended limited period – total pensionable service
66D.—(1) This article applies where—

a person joined this Scheme as a special member or as a standard member in respect of service which that person could otherwise reckon as special pensionable service and purchased service following an application under article 65A;
(b)
that person purchased additional service under article 65 at the same time as the election under article 65A;
(c)
that person elects to purchase service in respect of the extended limited period under article 65B; and
(d)
the addition of the period of service in respect of the extended limited period to the member’s special pensionable service (within the meaning in article 56A(1)) would result in a period exceeding 30 years.
(2) The Board must revise the election to purchase additional service under article 65, in accordance with paragraph (3), so that the total special pensionable service does not exceed 30 years by the member’s normal retirement age.
(3) The period by which the total special pensionable service would exceed 30 years (“the excess service”) at the member’s normal retirement age is to be deducted from the additional service which the member elected to purchase under article 65.
(4) Any contributions paid by the member in respect of the excess service are to be deducted from the contributions due in respect of the service in respect of the extended limited period under article 65B.
(5) Where the contributions paid by the member in respect of the excess service exceed the contributions due in respect of the service purchased under article 65B, the Board is to refund the excess contributions to the member.
Compensation deduction
66E.—(1) The Board must deduct from a special member’s mandatory special period pension contributions an amount calculated in accordance with this article (the “compensation deduction”) where a special member—
(a)
elects to pay mandatory special period pension contributions in respect of the special member’s service during the mandatory special period in accordance with article 66A, in relation to service purchased following an application under article 65B; and
(b)
provides the statement referred to at paragraph (5).
(2) The compensation deduction must be calculated on the advice of the Scheme Actuary and must be equal to the amount of tax relief on mandatory special period pension contributions to which the special member would have been entitled in the compensation scenario described in paragraph (3) (“the compensation scenario”), together with interest calculated at the past interest rate and applied to that amount of tax relief as described under article 66A(13), taking into account any tax relief on mandatory special period pension contributions that has been received through PAYE.
(3) The compensation scenario means that it is assumed that the special member—
(a)
had been entitled to join this Scheme as a special member on the first day of the mandatory special period;
(b)
from that date, had paid the special period pension contributions in accordance with article 63(1A), deducted from each instalment of the member’s pensionable pay in accordance with article 63(2); and
(c)
tax relief on the special period pension contributions at the rate set out in paragraph (4) had been applied at the time each instalment of pensionable pay had been paid.
(4) The rate of tax relief which must be applied in the compensation scenario is—
(a)
where a special member establishes, with such supporting evidence as the Board may reasonably require, that the rate of tax relief which would have applied to the special member in the compensation scenario is a higher tax rate, that higher tax rate; or
(b)
in any other case, the basic rate of tax that would have applied to the special member during the mandatory special period.
(5) In order to be entitled to the compensation deduction, the special member must provide a statement to the Board that the special member will not claim tax relief in respect of the mandatory special period pension contributions.”.

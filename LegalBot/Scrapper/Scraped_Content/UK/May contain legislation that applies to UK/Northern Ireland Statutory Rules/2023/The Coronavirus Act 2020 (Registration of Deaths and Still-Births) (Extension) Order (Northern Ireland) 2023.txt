(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 18(3) of, and Part 3 of Schedule 13 to, the Coronavirus Act 2020 contain provisions relating to the registration of deaths and still-births in Northern Ireland.
Section 89(1) provides for the Act to expire at the end of the period of 2 years beginning with the day on which it was passed (25th March 2020). This is subject to limited exceptions. Section 90 allows expiring provisions to be extended for not more than 6 months from the date on which they would otherwise expire (whether by virtue of section 89 or previous Orders made under section 90).
This Order extends section 18(3) and paragraphs 17 to 22 and 27 to 29 of Schedule 13 by a further 6 months so that they will expire on 24th September 2023.

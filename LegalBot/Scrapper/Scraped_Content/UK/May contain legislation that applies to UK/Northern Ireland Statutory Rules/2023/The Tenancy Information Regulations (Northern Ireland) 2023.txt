Appendix 1 – Repairs
A landlord and tenant can agree to divide responsibility for repairs as they wish, except for gas appliances and furniture safety, which are the responsibility of the landlord.
However, where a tenancy began after 1st April 2007 and where there is not a clear division of responsibility for repairs, the law imposes what are known as ‘default terms’.
This means that if a tenancy agreement either does not refer to repairing responsibilities, or does not describe these in enough detail, the following will apply:
The landlord is responsible for:
Repairing the structure and exterior of the property, including exterior paintwork, drains, gutters and pipes,
Repairing the interior of the property other than matters covered under tenant responsibilities (see below),
Repairing any installations for the supply and use of water, gas, electricity and sanitation including baths, sinks, wash-hand basins and toilets,
Repairing any appliances provided by the landlord,
Repairing any installations for heating and water heating,
Any fixtures, fittings and furnishings provided by the landlord,
Keeping in good repair any common areas or areas required for access, and
Keeping any area required for access adequately lit and safe to use.
The tenant is responsible for:
Taking proper care of the property as a good tenant,
Fixing any damage caused by tenants, household members or guests,
Keeping the interior in reasonable decorative order, and
Not altering the property without the landlord’s permission.
Responsibility for other repairs depends on what the landlord and tenant agree themselves.
A landlord is not responsible for maintaining gas appliances which the tenant will take with them at the end of the tenancy.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Specified Diseases (Notification) Order (Northern Ireland) 2004 by adding a number of diseases of animals to the list of specified diseases in Schedule 1. It also extends the definition of disease in the Diseases of Poultry Order (Northern Ireland) 1995 to include avian mycoplasmosis and avian chlamydiosis. The effect is to make these additional diseases subject to the controls specified in the 2004 and 1995 Orders.
This Order also amends Schedule 2 to the Diseases of Animals (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 (power to slaughter animals and pay compensation) by extending the powers of the Department to provide for the slaughter of animals and payment of compensation in relation to outbreaks or suspected outbreaks of Pleuro-pneumonia and Glanders. This Order extends the species for both these diseases, which the Department can cause to be slaughtered and for which compensation is payable.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this Order as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

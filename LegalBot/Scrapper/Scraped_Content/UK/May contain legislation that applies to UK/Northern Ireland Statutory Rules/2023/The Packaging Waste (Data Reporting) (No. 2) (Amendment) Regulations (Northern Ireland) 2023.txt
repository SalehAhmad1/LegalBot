Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made to correct errors in The Packaging Waste (Data Reporting) (No.2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 (S.R. 2023 No. 25) (“the first Regulations”), to make further provision clarifying when a brand owner is a producer in relation to packaging and to assign responsibility for certain packaging to packer/fillers, rather than brand owners, and to importers.
A full impact assessment of the effect that the first Regulations will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available form www.legislation.gov.uk and from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Klondyke Building, Cromac Avenue, Gasworks Business Park, Malone Lower, Belfast BT7 2JA.

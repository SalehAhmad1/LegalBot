A1.85.—(1) At a meeting in respect of a moratorium under Part 1A of the Order, a vote must be disregarded if—
(a)
a proof in respect of the claim is not received by the convener on or before 4.00p.m. on the business day before the date of the meeting unless under Rule A1.83 or A1.86(1)(b)(ii) (as applicable) the chair is content to accept the proof later; or
(b)
the convener decides, on the application of Rules A1.86 to A1.90, that the creditor is not entitled to cast the vote.
(2) For a decision to be made at a meeting there must be at least one valid vote.
Creditors’ voting rights
A1.86.—(1) At a meeting of creditors in respect of a moratorium under Part 1A of the Order a creditor is entitled to vote only if—
(a)
the creditor has delivered to the convener a proof of the debt claimed as due to them from the company, including any calculation for the purposes of Rule A1.87 or A1.88; and
(b)
the proof was received by the convener—
(i)
not later than 4.00p.m. on the business day before the meeting; or
(ii)
later than the time given in head (i) where the chair is content to accept the proof; and
(c)
the proof has been admitted for the purposes of entitlement to vote.
(2) A proxy-holder is not entitled to vote on behalf of a creditor unless the convener or chair has received the proxy intended to be used on behalf of that creditor.
(3) The convener or chair may call for any document or other evidence to be produced if the convener or chair thinks it necessary for the purpose of substantiating the whole or any part of a claim.
Calculation of voting rights
A1.87.—(1) Votes at a meeting in respect of a moratorium under Part 1A of the Order are calculated according to the amount of each creditor’s claim as at the date of the meeting.
(2) In relation to a meeting in respect of a moratorium under Part 1A of the Order, a debt of an unliquidated or unascertained amount is to be valued at £1 for the purposes of voting unless the convener or chair decides to put a higher value on it.
(3) Where a debt is wholly or partly secured the value of a debt for voting purposes is its full value without deduction of the value of the security where in respect of a moratorium under Part 1A of the Order, there is a meeting of pre-moratorium creditors on whether to extend or further extend that moratorium under Article 13CB.
(4) In the case of a meeting of creditors held pursuant to an order of the court under Article 13FB(3) the value for voting purposes of a debt which is wholly secured is nil, and the value for voting purposes of a debt which is partly secured is the value of the unsecured part.
(5) No vote may be cast in respect of a claim more than once on any resolution put to the meeting.
(6) Paragraph (5) does not prevent a creditor from—
(a)
voting in respect of less than the full value of an entitlement to vote; or
(b)
casting a vote one way in respect of part of the value of an entitlement and another way in respect of some or all of the balance of that value.
Calculation of voting rights: special cases
A1.88.—(1) In a meeting in respect of a moratorium under Part 1A of the Order, a creditor under a hire-purchase agreement is entitled to vote in respect of the debt due and payable by the company at the date of the meeting.
(2) In calculating the amount of any debt for the purpose of paragraph (1) no account is to be taken of any amount attributable to the exercise of any right under the relevant agreement so far as the right has become exercisable solely by virtue of a moratorium for the company coming into force.
Procedure for admitting creditors’ claims for voting
A1.89.—(1) The convener or chair in respect of a creditors’ meeting must ascertain entitlement to vote and admit or reject claims accordingly.
(2) The convener or chair may admit or reject a claim in whole or in part.
(3) If the convener or chair is in any doubt whether a claim should be admitted or rejected, the convener or chair must mark it as objected to and allow votes to be cast in respect of it, subject to such votes being subsequently declared invalid if the objection to the claim is sustained.
Requisite majority
A1.90.—(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a decision in respect of a moratorium under Part 1A of the Order is made when a majority (in value calculated in accordance with A1.87 and A1.88 as the case may be) of those voting have voted in favour of the proposed decision.
(2) A decision is not made if, of the total number of those creditors voting in respect of the proposed decision who are, to the best of the convener’s belief, unconnected with the company, a majority vote against it.
(3) For the purpose of paragraph (2) a creditor is unconnected unless the convener decides that the ceditor is connected.
(4) In the case of a decision which is required by virtue of an order under Article 13FB(3) paragraphs (1) and (2) have effect subject to such modifications as may be set out in the court’s order.
Appeals against decisions under this chapter
A1.91.—(1) A decision of the convener or chair under this Chapter is subject to appeal to the court by a creditor.
(2) Subject to paragraph (3), on an appeal against a decision taken, or required, under Part 1A of the Order the court may—
(a)
reverse the decision;
(b)
vary the decision;
(c)
declare certain votes to be invalid; or
(d)
make such other order as it sees fit.
(3) The court must not make an order of the kind referred to in paragraph (2)(a) to (c) if—
(a)
it is satisfied that the circumstances which led to the appeal did not give rise to unfair prejudice or material irregularity; or
(b)
the decision was taken at a time when the moratorium was in force, and that moratorium has subsequently come to an end.
(4) An appeal under this Rule may not be made later than 21 days after the decision date.
(5) The person who made the decision is not personally liable for costs incurred by any person in relation to an appeal under this Rule unless the court makes an order to that effect.
Record of a decision
A1.92.—(1) The convener or chair must cause a record of the meeting to be kept.
(2) The record must be in the form of a minute of the meeting.
(3) The record must be authenticated by the convener or chair and be retained by the monitor as part of the records of the moratorium.
(4) The record must identify the proceedings, and must include—
(a)
a list of the names of the creditors who participated and their claims; and
(b)

(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Insolvency Rules (Northern Ireland) 1991 (S.R. 1991 No. 364) (“the principal Rules”) in connection with the introduction of the new moratorium procedure (“the moratorium”) in Part 1A of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (S.I. 1989/2405 (N.I. 19)) (“the 1989 Order”) and the repeal of Schedule A1 to that Order.
Section 4 of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (c.12) (“CIGA 2020”) inserted a new Part A1 into the 1989 Order. Part A1 provides for a moratorium (“the moratorium”) which, in summary, enables an eligible company to obtain certain protections from creditors. Schedule 8 to CIGA 2020 contains temporary rules for the purpose of the moratorium. Those temporary rules were enacted so that the moratorium could be given immediate effect pending the making of these Rules. In addition, section 5 of CIGA 2020 repealed Schedule A1 to the 1989 Order. Schedule A1 contained provision for a different form of moratorium which was, in effect, superseded by the coming into force of the moratorium.
These Rules are in three Parts. Part 1 contains introductory provision dealing with the coming into operation and territorial extent of the Rules. Rules 4 and 5 make saving provision for cases where a moratorium, (or a moratorium under Schedule A1 to the 1989 Order), is in effect, (or, in certain cases, an application for a moratorium has been made), at the time these Rules come into operation. If that is the case then the amendments made by these Rules do not apply; instead the rules that applied at the time that the moratorium first came into effect, (or the application for the moratorium was made), continue to apply for the life of that moratorium.
Part 2 of these Rules inserts a new Part into the principal Rules setting out the detailed procedures for the conduct of the moratorium; in particular, it specifies the content and timing of the various notifications that are required to be given in connection with the obtaining, coming into force, extension and termination of the moratorium.
Part 3 of these Rules makes consequential amendments to Rule 0,2 and Parts 1, 2, 4, 7, 11 and 12 of, and Schedule 2 to, the principal Rules. These consequential amendments deal with matters such as: the notifications that must be given where a company enters another form of insolvency procedure during a moratorium; the identification of debts incurred during a moratorium which are required under the 1989 Order to have priority in subsequent insolvency procedures; and changes to rules concerning court procedure which are intended to be of general application so as to ensure that they also cover moratoriums.

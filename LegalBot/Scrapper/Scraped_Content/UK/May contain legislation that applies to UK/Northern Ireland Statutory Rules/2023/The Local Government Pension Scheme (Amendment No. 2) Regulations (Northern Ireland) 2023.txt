“Statutory underpin: general
4A.—(1) Regulations 4B to 4T (provisions relating to the statutory underpin) apply in relation to an eligible member’s remediable service(2) during the underpin period.
(2) An “eligible member” is a person who—
(a)
has remediable service in relation to the Scheme; or
(b)
has transferred remediable service into the Scheme from—
(i)
a Chapter 1 scheme(3);
(ii)
a judicial scheme(4); or
(iii)
another local government scheme(5).
(3) The “underpin period” is the period—
(a)
beginning with 1st April 2015; and
(b)
ending with the earlier of—
(i)
31st March 2022; and
(ii)
the date on which the eligible member attains—
(aa)
the normal retirement age applicable to them under the 2009 Scheme;
(bb)
where the person was not a member of the 2009 Scheme, the age of 65.
Statutory underpin: retirement, redundancy, ill-health
4B.—(1) This regulation applies in relation to an eligible member whose final underpin date is that in regulation 4H(1)(a), (c), (d) or (e) (statutory underpin: final underpin date).
(2) The pension account to which the final underpin date relates is to be increased by any final guarantee amount calculated in relation to that pension account.
(3) The pension account is to be increased on the day after the eligible member’s final underpin date.
Statutory underpin: flexible retirement
4C.—(1) This regulation applies in relation to an eligible member whose final underpin date is that in regulation 4H(1)(b) (statutory underpin: final underpin date – flexible retirement).
(2) The pension account to which the final underpin date relates (“the pension account”) is to be increased by a percentage of the final guarantee amount that is equal to the percentage of the retirement pension that the eligible member takes under regulation 31(6) (flexible retirement) of the 2014 Regulations.
(3) On each occasion where the amount of pension taken by the eligible member under regulation 31(6) of the 2014 Regulations is less than 100% of the member’s relevant pension, at the next occurring final underpin date (the subsequent final underpin date”), a further calculation of the eligible member’s final assumed benefits and final underpin amount relating to the flexible retirement is to be completed in accordance with regulations 4K and 4L.
(4) Where, on the subsequent final underpin date, the eligible member’s final assumed benefits are exceeded by their final underpin amount, the pension account is to be increased by a percentage of the original retirement pension that the eligible member took on the subsequent final underpin date.
(5) Where paragraph (2) or (4) applies, the pension account is to be increased on the day after the eligible member’s final underpin date or subsequent final underpin date, as the case may be.
(6) In paragraph (4), “original retirement pension” means the amount of the eligible member’s retirement pension as at the day of the eligible member’s first final underpin date.

began their reduced working hours or grade of employment during the underpin period; and
(b)
accrued benefits—
(i)
after taking payment of a retirement pension under regulation 31(6); but
(ii)
before the end of the underpin period.
(8) At the eligible member’s next occurring underpin date (the “additional underpin date”), the eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits and provisional underpin amount are calculated in accordance with regulations 4I and 4J, but—
(a)
the underpin period for the purpose of those calculations begins with the day on which the eligible member’s reduced hours or grade began; and
(b)
those calculations are not to include any period which has already been used in the calculation of a final guarantee amount in relation to the pension account.
(9) At the eligible member’s next occurring final underpin date (which may be on the same day as the additional underpin date, or after) the eligible member’s final assumed benefits and final underpin amount in relation to their pension account are calculated in accordance with regulations 4K and 4L but using the provisional assumed benefits and provisional underpin amounts as provided for in paragraph (8).
(10) Where the eligible member’s final assumed benefits, calculated in accordance with paragraph (9), are exceeded by their final underpin amount—
(a)
where the eligible member’s next occurring final underpin date is that in regulation 4H(1)(a) to (e), the pension account is to be increased on the day after that date by an amount equal to the difference;
(b)
where the eligible member’s next occurring final underpin date is that in regulation 4H(1)(f), regulation 4D(2) applies;

Statutory underpin: transfers
4E.—(1) This regulation applies to an eligible member whose final underpin date is that in regulation 4H(1)(g) or (h) (statutory underpin: final underpin date – transfer to a different scheme).
(2) Where this regulation applies—
(a)
no final guarantee amount is to be calculated in relation to the pension account; and
(b)
either—
(i)
where regulation 4H(1)(g) applies to the eligible member, regulation 108 (right to payment out of the pension fund) of the 2014 Regulations applies; or
(ii)
where regulation 4H(1)(h) applies to the eligible member, regulation 110 (bulk transfer (transfer of undertakings etc.)) of the 2014 Regulations applies.
Statutory underpin: members taking a repayment of contributions
4F.—(1) This regulation applies in relation to an eligible member whose final underpin date is that in regulation 4H(1)(i) (statutory underpin: final underpin date – receipt of repayment under regulation 20 (rights to return of contributions) of the 2014 Regulations).

Statutory underpin: calculation of provisional assumed benefits
4I.—(1) An eligible member’s “provisional assumed benefits” are calculated by assessing, at the eligible member’s underpin date, the benefits the eligible member would have been entitled to under the Scheme over the underpin period if—
(a)
the eligible member had paid contributions under regulation 11 of the 2014 Regulations in respect of the underpin period—
(i)
including—
(aa)
in respect of any period of absence from work because of illness or injury, child-related leave or reserve forces service leave;

where, on the underpin date, the eligible member left active membership with an entitlement to ill-health retirement under regulation 36 of the 2014 Regulations, any adjustment under regulation 39 of those Regulations in respect of the underpin period;
(cc)
in respect of any period of absence from work with no pensionable pay in consequence of a trade dispute if the eligible member elected to cover that period by entering into an arrangement under regulation 18 (additional pension contributions) of the 2014 Regulations; and
(dd)
in respect of any period of absence from work with permission with no pensionable pay in respect of which the eligible member elected to cover that period be entering into an arrangement under regulation 18 of the 2014 Regulations; but

any period where the eligible member was not an active member; and
(bb)
any period of unpaid absence from work without permission;
(b)
the eligible member or their employing authority had, in respect of the underpin period, paid no additional contributions under—

(d)
the scheme had received no transfer value payment in respect of the eligible member, except a transfer value payment received from—
(i)
a Chapter 1 scheme(12);
(ii)
a judicial scheme(13); or
(iii)
another local government scheme(14),
where the service in that scheme was remediable service and there was no continuous break of more than five years in active membership of a public service pension scheme since the remediable service was accrued;
(e)
the revaluation adjustment(15) that would have applied to the eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits had they been benefits built up in an active member’s pension account, had been made up to and including the eligible member’s underpin date;
(f)
no transfer value payment had been made to the eligible member’s pension account under regulation 12(5) or (6) (temporary reductions in contributions); and
(g)

(2) Where paragraph (1)(a)(i)(cc) or (dd) applies, the additional pension purchased is to be included in the provisional assumed benefits as if it were pension credited to the eligible member’s pension account on the earliest of —
(a)
31st March in the Scheme year in which the absence ended;
(b)
31st March 2022; and
(c)
the member’s underpin date.
(3) Where paragraph (2) applies, if the eligible member fails to pay all of the additional pension contributions due, only the amount of additional pension credited to the pension account is to be included in the provisional assumed benefits (but see paragraph (4)).
(4) Paragraph (3) does not apply if the eligible member fails to pay all the additional pension contributions due because—
(a)
the eligible member left active membership of the Scheme under regulation 36 (ill-health) of the 2014 Regulations with an entitlement to ill-health retirement; or
(b)
the eligible member died as an active member.
(5) Where paragraph (3) does not apply by virtue of paragraph (4), the eligible member is treated as having paid the additional pension contributions referred to in paragraph (1)(a)(i)(cc) or (dd) in full.
(6) Where paragraph (1)(a)(i)(cc) or (dd) applies in relation to a period during which the eligible member was paying reduced contributions under regulation 12 of the 2014 Regulations, the additional pension included in the provisional assumed benefits for that period is that which would have been payable had the eligible member not been paying reduced contributions.
(7) Where the eligible member has qualifying service for less than a period of two years, the member is treated as having qualifying service for a period of two years for the purpose of calculating their provisional assumed benefits.
(8) Paragraph (9) applies where, after the eligible member’s underpin date, the eligible member completes—

(10) Paragraph (9) does not apply if there has been a continuous break in active membership of a public service pension scheme of more than five years since the remediable service was accrued.
Statutory underpin: calculation of the provisional underpin amount
4J.—(1) The eligible member’s provisional underpin amount is calculated by assessing the benefits the eligible member would have been entitled to under the 2009 Scheme over the underpin period at the eligible member’s underpin date if—
(a)
the member had accrued membership under the 2009 Scheme, rather than the Scheme;
(b)
the period of membership taken into account for the purposes of sub-paragraph (a) was—
(i)
the period during which the member has paid, or is treated as having paid, contributions under regulation 11 or 12 (contributions and reduced contributions) of the 2014 Regulations;
(ii)
any period of unpaid absence due to a trade dispute, or absence from work with permission, otherwise than because of illness or injury, child related leave, or reserve forces service leave, if the eligible member elected to cover that period by entering into an arrangement under regulation 18 (additional pension contributions) of the 2014 Regulations; and
(iii)
where the member became entitled to ill-health retirement under regulation 36 of the 2014 Regulations, any additional period of membership that would have been added to the member’s total membership under regulation 20(2) of the Benefits Regulations(17) (Tier 1 ill-health pension), regulation 20(3) (Tier 2 ill-health pension), or regulation 20(6) (wholly or temporarily in part-time employment) of those Regulations up to the end of the underpin period, as if the member had been entitled to an increase in benefits under the provision in question at the underpin date;
(c)
the eligible member’s final pay used to calculate the provisional underpin amount is calculated in accordance with regulations 8 to 11 of the Benefits Regulations and those regulations apply in relation to the eligible member as if those Regulations were still in operation at the underpin date;
(d)
the eligible member had been credited with 2009 Scheme benefits in respect of remediable service transferred from—
(i)
a Chapter 1 scheme;
(ii)
a judicial scheme; or
(iii)
another local government scheme; and
there was no continuous break of more than five years in active membership of a public service pension scheme since the remediable service was accrued; and
(e)
where the balance in the eligible member’s pension account at the underpin date had been adjusted on account of any pension debit or Scheme pays election, that adjustment had not occurred.
(2) Where paragraph (1)(b)(ii) applies, the unpaid period to be used in relation to the provisional underpin amount is the proportion of the period of absence that is equal to the proportion of the full amount of contributions to be paid under the arrangement that have been paid by the eligible member.
(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply if the eligible member fails to pay all the additional pension contributions due because—
(a)
the eligible member left active membership of the Scheme with an entitlement to ill-health retirement under regulation 36 of the 2014 Regulations; or
(b)
the eligible member died.
(4) Where paragraph (2) does not apply, any part of the period of absence falling within the underpin period that is covered by the arrangement under regulation 18(1) or 18(3) of the 2014 Regulations (additional pension contributions) entered into by the eligible member is to be included in the calculation of the provisional underpin amount.
(5) Where the eligible member has qualifying service for less than a period of two years, the member is treated as having qualifying service for a period of two years for the purpose of calculating their provisional underpin amount.
(6) Paragraph (7) applies where, after the eligible member’s underpin date, the eligible member completes—
(a)
a transfer in of remediable service from—
(i)
a Chapter 1 scheme;
(ii)
a judicial scheme; or
(iii)
another local government scheme; or
(b)
the aggregation of remediable service from the Scheme.
(7) Where this paragraph applies—
(a)
the eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits are to be calculated as at the eligible member’s underpin date taking into account their transferred in or aggregated remediable service; and
(b)
any calculation of provisional assumed benefits done in respect of the pension account into which the remediable service has been transferred or aggregated is set aside.
(8) Paragraph (7) does not apply if there has been a continuous break in active membership of a public service pension scheme of more than five years since the remediable service was accrued.
Statutory underpin: calculation of final assumed benefits
4K.—(1) An eligible member’s final assumed benefits are calculated by adjusting their provisional assumed benefits at the eligible member’s final underpin date in accordance with this regulation.
(2) Where the eligible member’s underpin date is not the same date as their final underpin date, apply any revaluation adjustment or index rate adjustment to provisional assumed benefits that would have applied to a deferred benefit in the Scheme as if the last day of scheme membership was the underpin date.
(3) Where regulation 31(4) of the 2014 Regulations (pension taken later than normal pension age) applies to the eligible member, apply the enhancement as set out in that provision to provisional assumed benefits.
(4) Where regulation 31(5) (pension taken earlier than normal pension age) or (6) (pension by virtue of flexible retirement) of the 2014 Regulations applies to the eligible member and their benefits under the Scheme are being reduced as set out in that provision, apply an equivalent reduction to provisional assumed benefits.
(5) Where paragraph (4) applies, also reflect in the reduction such transitional provisions under Schedule 3 as apply (if any) (85 year rule).
(6) Where—
(a)
the eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits include any additional pension under regulation 18 of the 2014 Regulations;
(b)
the member is taking payment of their pension before the normal pension age applicable to them under the Scheme; and
(c)
regulation 31(7)(a) of the 2014 Regulations (pension by virtue of redundancy or business efficiency) applies to reduce the amount of pension payable,
the additional pension referred to in sub-paragraph (a) is also to be reduced in accordance with regulation 31(7)(a) of the 2014 Regulations.
Statutory underpin: calculation of final underpin amount
4L.—(1) An eligible member’s final underpin amount is calculated by adjusting their provisional underpin amount at the eligible member’s final underpin date in accordance with this regulation.
(2) Add any amount by which the provisional underpin amount would be increased if it were a pension to which the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971(18) applied, which relates to the period—
(a)
beginning with the day after the day on which the period used for the purposes of calculating the eligible member’s final pay under regulations 8 to 11 of the Benefits Regulations ends; and
(b)
ending with the eligible member’s final underpin date.
(3) Where an eligible member first receives payment of their retirement pension after the day on which they attain the age of 65, apply an enhancement calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Department.
(4) Where—
(a)
regulation 31(5) (pension taken earlier than normal pension age) or (6) (pension by virtue of flexible retirement) of the 2014 Regulations applies to an eligible member); and
(b)
the eligible member has not attained the age of 65,
apply an adjustment calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Department.
(5) Where paragraph (4) applies, the reduction is also to reflect such transitional provisions under Schedule 3 (85 year rule) as apply (if any).
Statutory underpin: survivor’s guarantee amount calculation
4M.—(1) This regulation applies where—
(a)
an eligible member dies; and
(b)
as a result, a survivor member’s pension becomes payable under regulation 41 (partners of active members), 43 (children of active members), 46 (partners of deferred members), 48 (children of deferred members), 52 (partners of pensioner members) or 53 (children of pensioner members) of the 2014 Regulations.
(2) A proportion of a survivor guarantee amount is to be added to a survivor member’s pension account in accordance with this regulation on the day after the eligible member’s death.
(3) A “survivor guarantee amount” is the amount by which an eligible member’s adjusted assumed benefits are exceeded by their adjusted underpin amount.
(4) The eligible member’s adjusted assumed benefits are calculated by adjusting their provisional assumed benefits as follows—
(a)
where the eligible member’s date of death is the same as their underpin date, increase the eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits by an amount equivalent to 1/49th of their annual assumed pensionable pay, calculated in accordance with regulation 23(4) of the 2014 Regulations as at the date of the eligible member’s death;
(b)
where, in the opinion of an IRMP, the member was at the date of their death in part time service wholly or partly as a result of the condition that caused or contributed to their death, the increase referred to in sub-paragraph (a) is to take no account of any reduction in pensionable pay due to such reduction in service as is attributable to that condition; and
(c)
where the eligible member’s date of death is not the same date as their underpin date, apply any revaluation adjustment or index rate adjustment that would have applied to a deferred benefit in the Scheme as if the last day of scheme membership was the underpin date.
(5) The increase referred to in paragraph (4)(a) applies in relation to the period—
(a)
beginning with the day after the eligible member’s death; and
(b)
ending with the earlier of—
(i)
31st March 2022; and
(ii)
the date on which the eligible member would have attained—
(aa)
the normal retirement age applicable to them under the 2009 Scheme; or
(bb)
where the person was not a member of the 2009 Scheme, the age of 65.
(6) The eligible member’s adjusted underpin amount is calculated by adjusting their provisional underpin amount as follows—
(a)
where the eligible member’s date of death is the same as their underpin date, increase the eligible member’s provisional underpin amount according to any additional period of membership that would have been added to the member’s total membership under regulation 20(2) of the Benefits Regulations up to and including 31st March 2022 if the member’s employment had been terminated on grounds of ill-health or infirmity of mind or body; and

add any increase that would apply were the adjusted underpin amount a pension to which the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 applied, which relates to the period—
(i)
beginning with the day after the day on which the period used for the purposes of calculating the eligible member’s final pay under regulations 8 to 11 of the Benefits Regulations ends; and
(ii)
ending with the date of the eligible member’s death.
(7) Where, in the opinion of the Committee, the eligible member was in part-time service at the date of their death wholly or partly as the result of the condition that caused or contributed to the member’s death, for the purposes of calculating the adjusted underpin amount no account is to be taken of any reduction in membership due to such reduction in service as is attributable to that condition.

(8) Paragraphs (9) and (10) apply where the eligible member has had a continuous break in active membership of a public service pension scheme of more than 5 years that began after the member’s active membership in relation to the inactive pension account that has been aggregated with the eligible member’s active pension account ceased.

(11) In this regulation—

The Department of Finance consents to these Regulations
Sealed with the Official Seal of the Department of Finance on 28th September 2023
Patrick Neeson
A senior officer of the Department of FinanceEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Public Service Pensions Act (Northern Ireland) 2014 (c. 2 (N.I.)) (“the 2014 Act”) makes provision and confers further powers to make provision (in the form of “scheme regulations” as defined in section 1 of that Act) about the establishment of public service pension schemes. The Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 (S.R. 2014 No. 188, (“the 2014 Regulations”)) are the scheme Regulations establishing the successor local government pension scheme (“the Scheme”) to the pension scheme constituted by the Local Government Pension Scheme (Benefits, Membership and Contributions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009, The Local Government Pensions Scheme (Administration) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 and the Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment and Transitional Provisions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 (“the 2009 Scheme”). The Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment and Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2014 (S.R. 2014 No. 189, (“the Transitional Regulations)) provide transitional protection (“the statutory underpin”) for 2009 Scheme members including, in particular, for members who were within 10 years of their normal pension age under the 2009 Scheme. Similar transitional protection was made under the 2014 Act for members of judicial pension schemes and members of firefighters pension schemes. The transitional protection for members of the judicial and firefighters schemes was subsequently found to unlawfully discriminate between members of the respective schemes on the basis of age. Although the statutory underpin was not subject to legal action, all schemes established under the 2014 Act are subject to review. These Regulations do this in relation to the Scheme.
The Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7) (“the PSPJOA 2022”), at Chapter 3 of Part 1, makes provision, and confers powers for scheme regulations under the 2014 Act to make further provision, in relation to specified service (“remediable service”, as defined in section 77 of PSPJOA 2022) of members who benefitted from the statutory underpin or who did not by reason of their age. Section 85 of PSPJOA 2022 requires certain powers in Chapter 3 of Part 1 to be exercised in accordance with Treasury Directions.
These Regulations are scheme regulations under the 2014 Act and are made in accordance with PSPJOA 2022 in relation to a member’s remediable service in the local government legacy schemes and the Scheme. They are, to the extent required by section 85 of PSPJOA 2022, made in accordance with Treasury Directions (in the form of the Public Service Pensions (Exercise of Powers, Compensation and Information) Directions (Northern Ireland) 2023). These Regulations have retrospective effect, which is authorised by section 3(3)(b) of the 2014 Act, to specified dates.
The retrospective provisions contained in these Regulations do not appear to the Department to have significant adverse effects in relation to the pension payable to or in respect of members of the scheme, or members of previous schemes. Accordingly, the procedures set out in section 23 of the Act are not applicable in relation to these Regulations.
Part 1 of these Regulations makes general provision.
Part 2 amends the Transitional Regulations in relation to the statutory underpin:
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 1 (citation, commencement interpretation and retrospection) to ensure that references to the definition of “scheme manager” should be read as “the Committee” in the Public Service Pensions (Exercise of Powers, Compensation and Information) Directions (Northern Ireland) 2023. The Northern Ireland Local Government Officers’ Superannuation Committee is the scheme manager for the Local Government Pension Scheme (Northern Ireland) and is referred to as “the Committee” in the LGPS Regulations.
Regulation 2(3) omits regulation 4 (which contained the original provision relating to the statutory underpin).
Regulation 2(4) inserts new regulations 4A to 4T, which, by their effect, replace regulation 4:
Regulation 4A makes provision in relation to the application of the replacement statutory underpin provisions to certain members (“eligible members”) and in respect of a certain period (“the underpin period”).
Regulation 4B makes provision for eligible members who become entitled to a pension on the basis of retirement, redundancy, or ill health to have their pension account increased by the final guarantee amount on the day after they become so entitled.
Regulation 4C makes provision for eligible members who become entitled to a pension on the basis of taking flexible retirement under regulation 31(6) of the 2014 Regulations to have their pension account increased by the final guarantee amount depending on the reason for their next final underpin date.
Regulation 4D prevents eligible members who take a lump sum payment from having their pension account increased by the final guarantee amount relating to the pension account.
Regulation 4E prevents eligible members who transfer to a different scheme from having a final guarantee amount determined in relation to their pension account.
Regulation 4F prevents eligible members who take a repayment of contributions from having a final guarantee amount calculated in respect of those repaid contributions.
Regulation 4G provides for an “underpin date” to be determined in respect of eligible members. The underpin date is the date in respect of which a provisional calculation of the member’s benefits under the Scheme and the 2009 Scheme in respect of the underpin period are made.
Regulation 4H provides for a “final underpin date” to be determined in respect of eligible members. The final underpin date is the date in respect of which the final calculation of the eligible members benefits under the Scheme and 2009 Scheme, on the basis of which the final guarantee amount is calculated.
Regulation 4I contains the calculation of an eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits. This is the provisional calculation of the benefits a member is entitled to under the Scheme.
Regulation 4J contains the calculation of an eligible member’s provisional underpin amount. This is the provisional calculation of the benefits a member would otherwise have been entitled to under the 2009 Scheme.
Regulation 4K provides for the calculation of an eligible member’s “final assumed benefits” for the purpose of the statutory underpin. This is the final calculation of the benefits the person is entitled to under the Scheme.
Regulation 4L provides for the calculation of an eligible member’s “final underpin amount” for the purpose of the statutory underpin. This is the final calculation of the benefits the person is entitled to under the 2009 Scheme.
Regulation 4M makes provision for the calculation of a “survivor guarantee amount” and for that amount to be added to a survivor member’s pension in respect of a deceased eligible member’s entitlement to a final guarantee amount.
Regulation 4N makes provision for the calculation of a “deferred guarantee amount” relating to an eligible member who is deceased and for that amount to be included in the calculation of a death grant payable in respect of the member.
Regulation 4O makes provision in relation to the calculation of provisional assumed benefits and provisional underpin amount for eligible members who have a pension account that has been aggregated from two or more pension accounts.
Regulation 4P makes provision for the calculation of the cash equivalent value of an eligible member’s relevant benefits (as defined in Article 26 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 (1999 No. 3147 (N.I. 11)) where the eligible member is divorced or dissolves a civil partnership.
Regulation 4Q empowers the Committee to pay additional benefits under the Scheme, instead of an amount under section 82 of PSPJOA 2022, in respect of a compensatable loss that is a Part 4 tax loss.
Regulation 4R prevents the Committee from paying an amount by way of compensation under section 82 of PSPJOA 2022, or additional benefits under regulation 4Q, unless the eligible member concerned or their personal representatives have made an application. It makes provision for the contents of such an application, requires the Committee to determine the amounts payable to the eligible member or their personal representatives and for appeals against such determinations.
Regulation 4S provides that compensation under section 82 of PSPJOA 2022 or regulation 4Q may be paid from the pension fund concerned.
Regulation 4T makes provision for the payment of interest in respect of the payment of an additional benefit under regulation 4S.
Regulation 2(5) amends regulation 9 of the Transitional Regulations to provide that where a transfer payment is received into the Scheme, which includes a payment in respect of remediable service, in respect of a person from a different public service pension scheme, that payment entitles the person to benefits under the Scheme, so long as there has been no continuous break of more than 5 years in active membership since the remediable service was accrued.
Regulation 2(6) amends Schedule 1 (interpretation) of the Transitional Regulations and introduces the concept of the “final guarantee amount”. This is the amount by which a member’s benefits under the Scheme (as assessed in accordance with the amendments made by these Regulations) are exceeded by the amount the member would have been entitled to under the local government legacy schemes.
Regulation 3 makes consequential amendments to the 2014 Regulations, including the following:
Regulation 3(2) amends regulation 31 (retirement benefits) to provide, in respect of a member’s pension, that an enhancement (where the member receives their pension after their normal pension age), reduction, (where the member receives their pension earlier than their normal retirement age), or adjustment, (where the member reduces working hours or grade), does not apply to any final guarantee amount which has been added to the pension account in question.
Regulation 3(3) amends regulation 35 (commutation and small pensions) to provide that the pension used to calculate a member’s commutation payments may under certain circumstances include a final guarantee amount.
Regulation 3(4), (5), (7), (8), (9) and (10) exclude the final guarantee amount to which an eligible member may otherwise have been entitled from the pension the member would have been entitled to for the purpose of the calculation of survivor benefits.
Regulation 3(6) makes similar provision in relation to death grants.
Regulation 3(11) and (12) provides that compensation paid under section 82 of PSPJOA 2022 or additional benefits paid under regulation 4Q are liabilities for the purpose of actuarial valuations of a pension fund’s liabilities.
Regulation 3(13) amends regulation 91 (interest on late payment of certain benefits) to disapply its provisions on the payment of interest in relation to sums in respect of which interest is payable under regulation 4T of the Transitional Regulations or regulation 14.
Regulation 3(14) amends regulation 108 (rights to payment out of the fund) to provide that, where a non-Club transfer out of the pension fund is applied for by an eligible member under paragraph (1) of that regulation, the value of the transfer is to be calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Department, taking into account the member’s provisional underpin amount and provisional assumed benefits.
Regulation 3(15) amends regulation 110 (bulk transfer (transfers of undertakings, etc) to provide that an actuary determining the amount of a bulk transfer payment must take into account the member’s provisional underpin amount and provisional assumed benefits.
Regulation 3(16) amends regulation 111 (calculation of the amount of transfer value payment) to ensure the actuary takes the member’s provisional underpin amount and provisional assumed benefits in to account when calculating a transfer value.
Regulation 3(17) amends Schedule 1 (interpretation) by adding definitions for the “final guarantee amount” and “the PSPJOA 2022”.
Part 3 makes provision in relation to certain specified classes of person to put them in the position they would have been had the amendments made by these Regulations been in operation from 2015. The provision being made is as follows:
Regulation 4 makes general provision, including about the persons to whom, or in respect of whom, provision is made.
Regulation 4(4) provides that in respect of specified categories of person the amendments made by regulations 2 and 3 are to have retrospective effect from 1st April 2015.
Regulation 5 makes provision in relation to members who retired or died before 1st October 2023. It is to be determined whether the person should be entitled to a final guarantee amount. If so, the amount is to be paid to the member’s pension account or personal representatives.
Regulation 6 makes provision in relation to death grants in respect of members who died before 1st October 2023. Provisional assumed benefits and a provisional underpin amount are to be calculated in respect of the member and regulation 46 (death grants: deferred members and pension credit members) of the 2014 regulations is to be applied to recalculate the death grant, with any excess being paid to the original recipients of the death grant.
Regulation 7 makes provision in relation to pensioner member death grants in respect of members who died before 1st October 2023. The death grant payable in respect of the person is to be recalculated under regulation 51 (death grants: pensioner members) and the amount is to be paid to the original recipients of the death grant.
Regulation 8 makes provision in relation to survivor benefits in respect of members who died before 1st October 2023. Provisional assumed benefits and a provisional underpin amount are to be calculated in respect of the member and regulation 4M is to be applied to the person and any survivor guarantee amount is to be added to the original survivor member’s pension account payable under regulation 41 (survivor benefits: partners of active members), 43 (survivor benefits: children of active members), 47 (survivor benefits: partners of deferred members), 48 (survivor benefits: children of deferred members), 52 (survivor benefits: partners of pensioner members) or 53 (survivor benefits: children of pensioner members) of the 2014 Regulations.
Regulation 9 makes provision in relation to members who transferred into the fund before 1st October 2023 from certain schemes. Where that transfer results in the person being entitled to benefits under the Scheme or having a transfer value accepted under regulation 112 (inward transfers of pension rights) of the 2014 Regulations, the transfer is to be treated as a transfer to which regulation 9(1ZA) (transfers) and, as the case may be (1ZB) of the Transitional Regulations applies.
Regulation 10 makes provision in relation to members who transferred out of the fund before 1st October 2023 under regulation 108 (rights to payment out of the pension fund) or 110 (bulk transfer (transfer of undertakings, etc) of the 2014 Regulations. Provisional assumed benefits and a provisional underpin amount are to be calculated in respect of the member and the transfer value is to be recalculated. Where a payment must be made, it is to be made to the trustees or manager of the new scheme for the benefit of the person.
Regulation 11 provides that where a person took a trivial commutation payment or lump sum under regulation 35(1) (commutation and small pensions) of the 2014 Regulations before 1st October 2023, it is to be determined whether the person is entitled to a final guarantee amount in accordance with regulations 4A to 4T of the Transitional Regulations.
Regulation 12 makes provision in relation to members who divorced or dissolved a civil partnership before 1st October 2023. The cash equivalent value of the person’s relevant benefits (for the purposes of Article 26 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1999) is to be recalculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Department. Where the recalculated amount exceeds the original calculation, the annual pension awarded to the member’s spouse or civil partner is to be recalculated based on that amount.
Regulation 13 makes provision for a member with underpin dates (within the meaning of regulation 4G of the Transitional Regulations) that occur before 1st October 2023, but who do not have a final underpin date (within the meaning of regulation 4H of those Regulations) before that date. This regulation makes provision for the calculation of a provisional underpin amount and provisional assumed benefits in relation to the member and for the modification of the provision applying a final underpin date to the member.
Regulation 14 makes provision for the payment of interest in respect of sums payable under this Part of the Regulations.
Part 4 contains minor amendments unrelated to the changes made to the statutory underpin.
Regulation 15 has retrospective effect from 1st April 2009.
Regulation 16 has retrospective effect from 1st April 2015.
Regulations 17 and 18 have retrospective effect from 1st April 2023.

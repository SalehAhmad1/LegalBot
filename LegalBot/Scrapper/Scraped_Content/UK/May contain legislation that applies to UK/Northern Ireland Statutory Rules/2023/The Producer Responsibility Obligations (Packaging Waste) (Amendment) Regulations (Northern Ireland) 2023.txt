(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 (S.I. 2007 No. 198) (the “2007 Regulations”). The 2007 Regulations impose on producers the obligation to recycle packaging waste in order to attain the recycling targets set out in Article 6(1) of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (OJ No L 365, 31.12.94, p10), as last amended by Directive (EU 2018/852).
These Regulations set an overall recycling target as well as material-specific recycling targets for 2024 on obligated producers in Northern Ireland in relation to glass, plastic, aluminium, steel, paper/board, and wood.

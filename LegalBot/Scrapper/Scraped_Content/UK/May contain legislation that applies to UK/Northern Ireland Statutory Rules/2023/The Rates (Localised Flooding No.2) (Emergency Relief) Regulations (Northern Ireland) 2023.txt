A senior officer of the Department of FinanceEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for emergency rate relief in respect of specified hereditaments for the financial year ending before 1st April 2024. The relief is being provided in order to provide support to businesses who have had to temporarily relocate as a result of severe localised flooding that occurred in Northern Ireland between 29th October 2023 and 18th November 2023.
Regulation 3 removes any rates liability that arises for specified hereditaments between 1st November 2023 and 1st April 2024.
Regulation 4 allows for the removal of liability under regulation 3 to apply to the NAV element of a mixed hereditament that appears on the non-domestic valuation list.
Regulation 5 provides that where rates are payable by the owner rather than the occupier of a business hereditament, the reduction of rates is conditional on the owner applying the amount of the reduction for the benefit of the occupier.
Regulation 6 makes provision to ensure that the relief provided under these Regulations is applied after the rate relief provided under the Rates (Small Business Hereditament Relief) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 (S.R. 2010 No. 4) as amended.
Regulation 7 makes provision that an amount of rate relief, determined in accordance with these Regulations, and subsequently found to have been paid in excess of entitlement shall be recoverable by the Department as rates due and payable.

(3C) In the case of a worker who on the calculation date has been employed by their employer for less than 12 complete weeks, the “relevant period” is the number of complete weeks for which the worker has been employed.
(3D) In the case of a worker who on the calculation date has been employed by their employer for 12 or more complete weeks, the “relevant period” is the period of 12 weeks ending—
(a)
where the calculation date is the last day of the week, with that week, and
(b)
otherwise, with the last complete week before the calculation date.
(3E) In calculating the average weekly amount of payments for the purposes of (3B), no account is to be taken of any weeks during the relevant period in which—

a worker was, for any amount of time, on sick leave or leave provided for in Part IX of the 1996 Order.
(3F) If, in a case falling within paragraph (3D), any weeks are discounted under paragraph (3E), earlier weeks shall be taken into account so as to bring the number of weeks to 12 (or as close to 12 as possible).
(3G) For the purposes of paragraph (3F) no account is to be taken of remuneration in weeks preceding the period of 24 weeks ending—
(a)
where the calculation date is the last day of a week, with that week, and

Department for the EconomyEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision relating to employment under the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (c. 28) (“2023 Act”) by way of amendments to the Working Time Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 49) (“2016 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends regulation 15 and regulation 16 of the 2016 Regulations to include express provision about the rights of workers, in certain circumstances, to carry forward annual leave into subsequent leave years.
Regulation 20 of the 2016 Regulations is also amended to include express provision about the calculation of holiday pay in relation to annual leave taken under regulation 15, which is often referred to as “normal pay”. These new express provisions restate certain employment rights to ensure those rights continue once the interpretative effects of EU law on the UK statute book have been removed at the end of 2023.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these regulations as the purpose of the regulations is to restate certain employment rights to ensure those rights continue to apply from 1 January 2024.

The Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2018
Made
13th December 2018
Coming into operation
3rd January 2019
The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs M1 under the powers conferred by section 2(2) of, as read with paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972 M2 makes the following Regulations.
It is designated M3 for the purposes of that section in relation to measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields for the protection of public health.
It has carried out the consultation required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety M4.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Department that it is expedient for references to EU instruments referred to in Schedule 1 to be construed as references to those instruments as amended from time to time.

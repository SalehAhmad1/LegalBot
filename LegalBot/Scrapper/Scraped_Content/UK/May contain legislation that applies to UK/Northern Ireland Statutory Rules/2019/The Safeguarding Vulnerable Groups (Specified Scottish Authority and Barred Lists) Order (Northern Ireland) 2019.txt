Article 7 of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (Northern Ireland) Order 2007 (S.I. 2007/1351 (N.I. 11)) (“the 2007 Order”) provides that a person included in a specified children’s or adults’ list maintained by the Disclosure and Barring Service will be barred under the 2007 Order from regulated activity relating to the relevant group.
Under paragraphs 6 and 12 of Schedule 1 to the 2007 Order, a person must not be included in the relevant barred list in Northern Ireland only on a particular ground if a relevant Scottish authority has already considered whether the person should be included in a corresponding list on the same ground. This Order specifies a relevant Scottish authority and a corresponding list for the purposes of paragraphs 6 and 12 of Schedule 1 to the 2007 Order.
Article 3 of this Order specifies the Scottish Ministers as a relevant Scottish authority.
Article 4 specifies that the children’s list and the adults’ list maintained by the Scottish Ministers under the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 (asp 14) correspond respectively to the children’s barred list and the adults’ barred list maintained under the 2007 Order.

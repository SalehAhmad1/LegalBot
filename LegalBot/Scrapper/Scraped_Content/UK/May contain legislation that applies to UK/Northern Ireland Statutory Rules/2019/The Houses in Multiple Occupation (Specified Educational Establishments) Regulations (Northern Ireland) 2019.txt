(This note is not part of the Order)
Schedule 1 to the Houses in Multiple Occupation Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 (“the HMO Act”) lists types of building that are not houses in multiple occupation (“HMOs”). For the purposes of the HMO Act, HMOs are defined in section 1 of the Act. Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to the HMO Act refers to any building which is occupied solely or principally by persons who occupy it for the purpose of undertaking a full time course of further or higher education at a specified educational establishment, or at an educational establishment of a specified description, and where the person managing or controlling the building is the education establishment in question, or a specified person, or a person of a specified description.
Where a building is managed or controlled by an educational establishment which is listed in these Regulations and that educational establishment is a member of a recognised specified accreditation referred to in Regulation 5, then that building is not an HMO for the purposes of the HMO Act.

At 11.43 a.m. on 9th September 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These regulations amend the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 216) (“the 2016 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 extends the time which claimants have to report payment of childcare costs in order for those costs to be taken into account in the childcare costs element when calculating an award of universal credit.
Regulation 3 clarifies that the earnings threshold in regulation 89 of the 2016 Regulations, which, if met, exempts a claimant from work search and work availability requirements, is only relevant for a gainfully self-employed claimant insofar as that regulation is specifically cross-referred to in regulation 63(4). The minimum income floor, which has its own earnings threshold, cannot be avoided by a gainfully self-employed claimant who would be in the all work-related requirements group but for the earnings exemption in regulation 89.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no impact on business or civil society organisations.

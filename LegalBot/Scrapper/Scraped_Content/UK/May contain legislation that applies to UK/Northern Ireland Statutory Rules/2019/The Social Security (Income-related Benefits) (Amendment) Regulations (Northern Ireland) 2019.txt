(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to social security legislation as a consequence of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (Consequential Modifications) Order 2018 (S.I. 2018/872).
Scottish Ministers have agreed to pay a “carer’s allowance supplement” to qualifying individuals who, on dates to be determined by the Scottish Ministers, are both in receipt of “carer’s allowance” under section 70 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (c. 4) and resident in Scotland.
These Regulations provides for carer’s allowance supplement to be disregarded as income when determining a claimant’s entitlement to benefits under: the Income Support (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1987; the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1996; the Housing Benefit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006; and the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008. In both the State Pension Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002 and the Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006, the supplement is excluded from being a social security benefit which would otherwise be taken into account as income in determining entitlement to those benefits.

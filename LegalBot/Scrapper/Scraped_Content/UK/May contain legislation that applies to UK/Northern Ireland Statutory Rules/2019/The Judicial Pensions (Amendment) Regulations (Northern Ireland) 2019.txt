(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Judicial Pensions Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”) make provision for the contributions payable by members of the scheme constituted by the 2015 Regulations up to 31st March 2019.
These Regulations provide for the contribution rates applicable in the scheme year ending on that date to also apply for the following year. Since these Regulations involve a change to a protected element of the scheme constituted by the 2015 Regulations, the Department of Justice has consulted such persons and representatives of such persons as appear to it likely to be affected by these Regulations with a view to reaching agreement with them and has laid a report before the Assembly as required by section 22 of the Public Service Pensions Act (Northern Ireland) 2014. In accordance with section 24(1) of that Act, the pension board for the scheme constituted by the 2015 Regulations has stated that it considers these Regulations to be minor or wholly beneficial.

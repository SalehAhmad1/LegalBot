The amendments set out the revised requirements which apply in Northern Ireland in relation to forest reproductive material produced in countries outside the European Union and;
The Regulations implement in relation to Northern Ireland Council Decision 2008/971/EC on the equivalence of forest reproductive material produced in third countries (OJ No L 345, 23.12.2008, p83), as amended by Decision No. 1104/2012/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ No L 328, 28.11.2012, p1).

A senior officer of the Department for CommunitiesEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement Directive (EU) 2017/828 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017 amending Directive 2007/36/EC as regards the encouragement of long-term shareholder engagement by institutions for occupational retirement provision (O.J. No. L132, 20.5.17, p.1) (“the Directive”). They do so by amending the Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 (“the Investment Regulations”), the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 (“the Disclosure Regulations”) and the Pension Protection Fund (Pensionable Service) and Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment and Disclosure) (Amendment and Modification) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2018.
Regulation 2 implements Article 3h.2 (arrangements with asset managers) of the Directive by requiring trustees to include a policy on asset managers containing prescribed information in the statement of investment principles (“the SIP”) required under Article 35 of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 and the default SIP required under regulation 2A of the Investment Regulations.
Regulations 3 and 4 implement Articles 3g (disclosure of engagement policy and the engagement policy implementation) and 3h (disclosure of investment strategy) of the Directive by amending, amongst other things, regulations 4, 12 and 29A of, and paragraph 30 of Schedule 3 to, the Disclosure Regulations. They require, amongst other things, the trustees of all trust schemes which fall within the scope of Article 35 of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 to make available free of charge the engagement policy implementation statement and the SIP on a website, or where appropriate, in hard copy form to the public as a whole to enable people to have access to the SIP of occupational pension schemes.
Regulation 5 contains transitional provisions so that the trustees of a defined benefit scheme which starts to operate by a certain date are allowed until 1st October 2020 to comply with the requirement to publish the SIP on a website, or where appropriate, in hard copy form. In addition, they ensure that the trustees of a scheme which starts to operate by a certain date are allowed until 1st October 2020 to comply with the requirement to include certain information in the SIP and default SIP. They also ensure that the trustees of a scheme which starts to operate by a certain date are allowed until 1st October 2021 to comply with the requirement to publish certain information on a website, or where appropriate, in hard copy form.
As these Regulations, in so far as they are made under the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain, the requirement to consult under Article 117(1) of that Order does not apply by virtue of paragraph (2)(e) of that Article.
An assessment of the impact of these Regulations is detailed in a Regulatory Impact Assessment, a copy of which, together with a Transposition Note, are laid in the Business Office and the Library of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Copies are also annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum which is available alongside this Statutory Rule on the website: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr. Copies are also available from the Department for Communities, Social Security Policy and Legislation Division, Level 8, Causeway Exchange, 1-7 Bedford Street, Belfast BT2 7EG or from the website: https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/articles/pension-information.

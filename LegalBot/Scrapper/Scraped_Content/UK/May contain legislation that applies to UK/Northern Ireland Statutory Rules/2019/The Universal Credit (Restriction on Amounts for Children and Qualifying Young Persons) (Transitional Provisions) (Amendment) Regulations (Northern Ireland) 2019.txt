(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 226) (“the UC Transitional Regulations NI”), the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 216) (“the UC Regulations NI”) and Welfare Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2015 (Commencement No. 8 and Transitional and Transitory Provisions) Order 2017 (S.R. 2017 No. 190 (C. 11)) (“the No. 8 Order”). They simplify and extend the transitional protection for children and qualifying young persons born before 6th April 2017, the date when limits in relation to the child element in universal credit came into force.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 25A(3) of the UC Regulations NI by providing that transitional protection is available, in any claim, for a third or subsequent child or qualifying young person who was born before 6th April 2017.
Regulation 3 revokes regulation 40 of the UC Transitional Regulations NI, which contained a restriction on claims for universal credit during an “interim period” by claimants responsible for more than two children or qualifying young persons. Regulation 3 also revokes regulation 41 which set out the circumstances in which a child or qualifying young person was transitionally protected for the purposes of calculating the child element of a universal credit award under regulation 25A of the UC Regulations NI. During the interim period transitional protection was available for all children and qualifying young persons born before 6th April 2017 for whom the claimant was responsible. But after the interim period ended that protection was not to apply to new claims.
Regulation 4 makes consequential amendments to the No. 8 Order to remove references to regulation 40 of the UC Transitional Regulations NI.

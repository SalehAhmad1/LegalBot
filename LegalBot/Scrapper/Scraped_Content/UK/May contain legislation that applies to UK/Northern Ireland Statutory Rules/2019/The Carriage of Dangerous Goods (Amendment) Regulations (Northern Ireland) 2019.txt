The Carriage of Dangerous Goods (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2019
Made
21st May 2019
Coming into operation
18th June 2019
The Department for the Economy(1), being the Department concerned(2), makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of, and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(3) (“the 1972 Act”), Articles 17(1), (2) and (4) of, and paragraphs 1(1), (2) and (4), 2, 8, 12 and 13 of Schedule 3 to the Health and Safety at Work (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 (“the 1978 Order”)(4).
The Department was designated(5) for the purposes of section 2(2) of the 1972 Act in relation to safety measures in regard to radioactive substances and the emission of ionising radiation(6), measures relating to basic safety standards for health protection of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionising radiation, measures relating to informing the public about health protection measures to be taken in the event of a radiological emergency(7) and the environment(8).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the 1972 Act and it appears to the Department that it is expedient for references to Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation, and repealing Directives 89/618/Euratom, 90/641/Euratom, 96/29/Euratom, 97/43/Euratom and 2003/122/Euratom(9) to be construed as references to that Directive as amended from time to time.
The Regulations give effect without modifications to proposals submitted to it by the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland under Article 13(1A)(10) of the 1978 Order after the Executive had carried out consultations in accordance with Article 46(3)(11).

(8) Each duty holder with an obligation to prepare an emergency plan in accordance with this paragraph in relation to the carriage of a package shall cooperate with any other person who is a duty holder in respect of that package so as to enable each of those duty holders to fulfil their obligations under these Regulations.
Principles and purposes of emergency plans
4.—(1) The principles of intervention to which each duty holder is to have regard when drawing up an emergency plan are—
(a)
the necessity for the plan to respond to the particular characteristics of a given radiation emergency as those characteristics emerge;
(b)
the necessity to optimise protection strategies to ensure that the proposed response, as a whole, is predicted to do more to mitigate the radiation emergency and facilitate transition from that emergency than to increase its duration or consequence, taking into account—
(i)
the health risks arising from exposure to ionising radiation as a result of the radiation emergency, in both the long and the short term;
(ii)
the economic consequences of the radiation emergency;
(iii)
the effects of the disruption, both on the premises and the area immediately surrounding it, and on the public perception of the effects of the radiation emergency;
(c)
the necessity of avoiding, so far as possible, the occurrence of serious physical injury to any person;
(d)
the necessity of ensuring that an appropriate balance is struck between the expected harms and benefits of any particular protective measure so as to maximise the benefit of that measure.
(2) The purposes of intervention to which the duty holder is to have regard when drawing up an emergency plan are—
(a)
to reduce or stop the release of radiation;
(b)
to reduce the exposure to individuals and to the environment resulting from the release of ionising radiation;
(c)
if necessary, to ensure that provision is made for the medical treatment of those affected by the release of ionising radiation;
(d)
to prioritise the implementation of the plan in relation to a person exposed to dose consequences in excess of the reference level set out in paragraph 9(1).
Review and testing of emergency plan
5.—(1) If an emergency plan is to be used in relation to carriage on more than one occasion, each duty holder shall, at suitable intervals not exceeding three years—
(a)
review and, where necessary, revise the plan; and
(b)
test the plan, taking reasonable steps to arrange for all those with a role in the emergency plan to participate in the test to such extent necessary to ensure that the test is effective.
(2) A review required under sub-paragraph (1)(a) shall take into account—
(a)
changes occurring in the carriage of packages to which the plan relates;
(b)
changes within the emergency services concerned;
(c)
new knowledge or guidance, whether technical or otherwise, concerning the response to radiation emergencies;
(d)
any material change to the assessment on which the plan was based since it was last reviewed or revised; and
(e)
any relevant information derived from a report or review of the consequences of any radiation emergency.
(3) The test of a plan shall take into account any lessons learned from—
(a)
past emergency exposure situations, whether arising during the carriage of packages on behalf of the consignor or by the carrier; and
(b)
the United Kingdom’s participating in emergency exercises at national and international level.
(4) The test of the plan shall be sufficient to test the ability to implement the plan in question but the duty holder shall consider the extent of the testing required taking into account—
(a)
the length of time since the last test;
(b)
the extent of testing undertaken on the last occasion; and
(c)
any revisions made by the review required under sub-paragraph (1)(a).
(5) After completion of the test required by sub-paragraph (1)(b), the duty holder shall prepare a report on the outcome of the test within 28 days of the conclusion of the test.
(6) A report made under sub-paragraph (5) must be sent to the Northern Ireland competent authority within 28 days of its preparation.

(ii)
the results of the dose assessments carried out under sub-paragraph (i) to be notified without delay to the employer and the Northern Ireland competent authority;
(f)
make arrangements, in respect of dose assessments to be carried out and notified pursuant to sub-paragraph (e), to notify the results of such assessments without delay to the appointed doctor or employment medical adviser who is carrying out medical surveillance on the employee to whom the assessment relates; and
(g)
identify those employees who are authorised, in the event of a radiation emergency, to permit any employee referred to in sub-paragraph (a) to be subject to an emergency exposure and provide employees who are so authorised with appropriate training.
(2) The duty holder shall notify the Northern Ireland competent authority of the dose levels which they have determined are appropriate to be applied in respect of an employee identified for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(a) in the event of an emergency.
(3) A notification under sub-paragraph (2) shall be given—
(a)
in relation to transport of class 7 goods by road, rail or inland waterway which is to be carried out once only, at least 28 days before the transport is carried out, or within such shorter time as the Northern Ireland competent authority may agree;
(b)
in relation to any other transport of class 7 goods by road, rail or inland waterway, at least 28 days before the transport is first carried out, or within such shorter time as the Northern Ireland competent authority may agree.
(4) Where the carrier and the consignor together determine that a dose level notified under sub-paragraph (2) is no longer appropriate to be applied in respect of an employee for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(a) in the event of such an emergency, and that a revised dose level is to be determined, the duty holder shall, at least 28 days before formally determining the revised dose level, or within such shorter time as the Northern Ireland competent authority agrees, notify the Northern Ireland competent authority of the revised dose level which the operator considers is appropriate to be applied.
(5) In any case where, in the opinion of the Northern Ireland competent authority, the dose levels for emergency exposure notified pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) or (4) are too high, the carrier and the consignor shall, if directed to do so by the Northern Ireland competent authority, substitute such other dose level or levels as the Northern Ireland competent authority considers appropriate.
(6) Where an emergency plan is initiated, each employer shall ensure—

the requirements of sub-paragraph (1)(a) to (f) have been complied with in respect of the employee; and
(iii)
that employee has been permitted to be so by an employee authorised for that purpose under sub-paragraph (1)(g); and
(c)
that no employee of that employer involved in implementing an emergency plan is exposed to a dose of ionising radiation in excess of the dose level determined in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), (4) and (5).
(7) The requirement imposed on the employer under sub-paragraph (6)(a) in respect of a female employee who is pregnant or breastfeeding does not apply until that employee has notified the employer in writing of that fact or until the date from which the employer ought reasonably to have been aware of that fact.
(8) The requirement imposed by sub-paragraph (6)(c) does not apply in respect of an exposure of any employee who—
(a)
being informed about the risks involved in the intervention, agrees to undergo an exposure greater than any dose level referred to in that paragraph for the purpose of saving human life; and
(b)
is permitted to undergo such exposure by an employee authorised by the employer under sub-paragraph (1)(g) to give such permission.
(9) Where an employee has undergone an emergency exposure, the employer shall ensure that the dose of ionising radiation received by that employee is assessed by an approved dosimetry service and that the dose assessed is recorded separately in the dose record of that employee or, where no dose record exists, in a record created for the purpose of this sub-paragraph complying with the requirements to which it would be subject if it were a dose record.
(10) An employer shall, at the request of that employer’s employee in circumstances where a dose record has been created for the purposes of sub-paragraph (9) and on reasonable notice being given, obtain from the approved dosimetry service and make available to the employee a copy of the record of the dose relating to that employee.
(11) In the event of a report being made under paragraph 6(6)(c) relating to the circumstances of an emergency exposure and the action taken as a result of that exposure, an employer shall keep such a report (or copy of that report) until the person to whom the report relates has or would have attained the age of 75 years but in any event for at least 30 years from the termination of the work which involved the emergency exposure.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 (“the 2010 Regulations”) in order to implement, in part, as respects Northern Ireland provisions of Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom (OJ No L13, 17.1.2014, p 1) laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation, and repealing Directives 89/618/Euratom, 90/641/Euratom, 96/29/Euratom, 97/43/Euratom and 2003/122/Euratom.
Regulation 3 provides that the Part 5 of the 2010 Regulations applies to the carriage of class 7 goods by inland waterway.
Regulation 4 substitutes a heading in Part 5 of the 2010 Regulations.
Regulation 5 substitutes regulation 20 in the 2010 Regulations, providing that Part 5 applies only in relation to the carriage of class 7 goods, and regulation 6 introduces Schedule 2.
Regulation 7 contains transitional provisions.
The Schedule to these Regulations, which contains a new Schedule 2 makes provision in connection with radiation emergencies and imposes notification obligations in situations where radioactive material is lost or stolen.
In Great Britain the corresponding Regulations are the Carriage of Dangerous Goods (Amendment) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/598). As impact to Northern Ireland industry will be mainly restricted to one off familiarisation with the revised provisions and costs to individual dutyholders will be negligible, a Regulatory Impact Assessment is not required. A copy of the transposition note can be obtained from the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland, 83 Ladas Drive, Belfast, BT6 9FR. A copy of this document is annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum which is available alongside these Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

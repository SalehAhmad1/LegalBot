(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Court of Judicature Fees Order (Northern Ireland) 1996 (S.R.1996 No. 100) to increase fees payable in the Court of Judicature and to introduce the following new fees:
on listing of a first case management review hearing (Fee No.5(e))
for certification of a pending action for the purpose of registering it as a burden affecting land (Fee 26).
The Order also makes some changes in relation to the availability of remissions and exemptions as follows:
a person subject to an order under s32 of the Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978 cannot seek a remission or exemption in respect of the fee for an application for leave to initiate or continue proceedings, however, if leave is granted the fee will be refunded, if appropriate; and
no remission or exemption will be available in respect of the fees for copy documents, searches and inspections and a certificate of the result of a search.
The Supreme Court Fees Order (Northern Ireland) 1996 has been renamed the Court of Judicature Fees Order (Northern Ireland) 1996 as a consequence of the renaming of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland by virtue of section 59 and paragraph 6 of Schedule 11 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (c. 4).

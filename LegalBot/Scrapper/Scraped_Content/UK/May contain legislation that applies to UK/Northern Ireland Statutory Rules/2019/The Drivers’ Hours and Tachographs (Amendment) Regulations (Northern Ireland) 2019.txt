Department for InfrastructureEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 to fully implement the EU Drivers’ Hours Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006) and the EU Tachographs Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 165/2014).
Article 2(3) of the EU Drivers’ Hours Regulation applies the European Agreement concerning the Work of Crews of Vehicles engaged in International Road Transport of 1st July 1970 (known as the “AETR”) in EU member states, requiring the implementing of the AETR in these states. The Regulations include provision implementing the AETR.
Part 1 of the Regulations contains introductory provisions. Part 2 contains amendments to Article 81 of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981. Article 81 provides for offences against applicable Community rules in relation to periods of driving, distance driven, or periods of off duty. The amendments ensure that contravention of AETR rules also constitutes an offence.
Part 3 of the Regulations contains amendments to secondary legislation. These amend and update existing statutory provision to ensure full implementation of EU obligations, including application of AETR rules.
In particular, the amendments implement penalties relating to testing requirements for security vulnerabilities, and penalties relating to the prohibition of the supply of recording equipment without a type approval certificate. They also provide for offences and penalties for failure to comply with AETR requirements - in particular, failure to properly install and use recording equipment; supplying recording equipment without a valid type approval certificate; and failing to notify authorities of security vulnerabilities.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1986.
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 4 to include new prescribed disease A15 (Dupuytren’s contracture) in the presumption that a disease is due to the nature of a person’s employment.
Regulation 2(3) amends Part 1 of Schedule 1, which sets out the diseases for which industrial injuries disablement benefit is payable, by adding new prescribed disease A15, Dupuytren’s contracture, as it relates to occupations involving the use of hand-held powered tools.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 7 of Schedule 5A to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2A) of that Act for prior reference to the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council.

Part 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, as amended by the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, empowers the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland (“the DPP”), with the leave of the Court of Appeal, to refer certain cases to that Court where the DPP considers that the sentences imposed were unduly lenient.
Article 2 specifies the offences in respect of which that power may be exercised.
Article 3 specifies cases in which a sentence is passed for attempting, encouraging or assisting the commission of any of the offences in Article 2.

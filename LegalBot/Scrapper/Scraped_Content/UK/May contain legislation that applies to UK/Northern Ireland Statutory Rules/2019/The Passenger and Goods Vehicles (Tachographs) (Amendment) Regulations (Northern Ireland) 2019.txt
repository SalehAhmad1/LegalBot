Department for InfrastructureEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Passenger and Goods Vehicles (Tachographs) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1996 in order to ensure that new requirements in relation to smart tachographs can be effectively enforced.
Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 sets out requirements in relation to the construction, installation, use, testing and control of tachographs used in road transport. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/799 of 18 March 2016 implementing Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 gives effect to new requirements in relation to the construction, testing, installation, operation and repair of smart tachographs and their components.
Northern Ireland’s domestic legislation is updated by these Regulations to include reference to Annex IC to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/799, which will ensure that appropriate provision for the enforcement of the new requirements is in place.
The Regulations also make consequential amendments to provisions in the Drivers’ Hours and Tachographs (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 which are not yet in force and which will no longer be required from Exit day as a result of these Regulations.

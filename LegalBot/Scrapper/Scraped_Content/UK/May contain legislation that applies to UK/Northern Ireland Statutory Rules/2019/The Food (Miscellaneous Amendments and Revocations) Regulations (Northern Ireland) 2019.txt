(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to a number of pieces of secondary legislation relating to food and feed.
Regulation 13 amends the Food Hygiene Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 (S.R. 2006 No. 3) to amend the definition of Regulation (EC) 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (OJ No L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 1) so as to require that Regulation to be read with new Commission Regulation (EU) No 2017/2158 establishing mitigation measures and benchmark levels for the reduction of the presence of acrylamide in food (OJ No L 304, 21.11.2017, p. 24).
Regulation 27 amends the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2013 (S.R. 2013 No. 253) to implement Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1040/2014 amending Council Directive 2001/112/EC relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption to adapt its Annex I to technical progress (OJ No L 288, 2.10.2014, p. 1). This allows plant proteins from wheat, peas and potatoes to be used for the clarification of products to which the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars Regulations (Northern Ireland 2013 apply.
These Regulations make other miscellaneous minor amendments to legislation relating to food and feed, in particular amending out of date references to domestic legislation and to EU instruments.

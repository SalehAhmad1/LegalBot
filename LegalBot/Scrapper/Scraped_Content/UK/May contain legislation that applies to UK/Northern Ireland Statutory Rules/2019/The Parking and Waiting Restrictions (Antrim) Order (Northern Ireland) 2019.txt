lengths of the roads specified in Schedule 1 to this Order. 
The Department has consulted such persons as it considered appropriate in compliance with 
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedules 1 and 4 to the Road Traffic Regulation (Northern Ireland) Order 
1997. 
The Department has published a notice in compliance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of those Schedules. 
The Department, in compliance with paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 4 to that Order, has taken such 
other steps as appear to the Department reasonably practicable for the purpose of bringing 
specifically to the knowledge of the occupiers of land adjacent to the parking places the particulars 
specified in paragraph 3(2) of that Schedule. 
No written objection or other representations have been received.

[F37.—(1) Paragraph (3) applies where a person (“P”), who has attained the qualifying age, would otherwise not be entitled to either housing benefit or universal credit, because—
(a)
but for that paragraph, P would be a member of the same household as a partner who has not attained the qualifying age and therefore a member of a mixed-age couple, who—
(i)
is prevented from claiming housing benefit under [F4regulation 4A of the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016] ; or

has an award of housing benefit terminated under Article 6; and
(b)
P is neither entitled to universal credit jointly with that partner, nor entitled to universal credit as a single person, in one of the cases set out in paragraph (2).
(2) The cases are where P is not entitled to universal credit because P has attained the qualifying age and—
(a)
any of the following paragraphs of regulation 3 of the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 applies, and in the case of paragraph (ii) below, one of the following circumstances applies—
(i)
paragraph (2) (treatment of certain couples – universal credit may only be claimed as a single person);
(ii)
paragraph (3) (treatment of polygamous marriages), so that P is not entitled to universal credit because P may only claim universal credit either as one of two parties to a polygamous marriage to be treated as a couple and the other party has also attained the qualifying age, or as a remaining party to such a marriage to be treated as single;
(iii)
paragraph (5) (absence from the household – universal credit may only be claimed as a single person); or
(b)
P lost joint entitlement to universal credit as part of a mixed-age couple due to one of the following changes of circumstances taking effect from a date (namely the first day of the universal credit assessment period in which the change occurred) that is earlier than when, but for paragraph (3), the same change would take effect for the purposes of housing benefit, those changes being where—
(i)
P and their partner are no longer a couple;
(ii)
P is party to a marriage that is no longer a polygamous marriage and P’s remaining spouse has attained the qualifying age.
(3) Where this paragraph applies—
(a)
P and their partner who are to be treated as a non-polygamous couple in accordance with paragraph (2)(a)(ii), or who are no longer parties to a polygamous marriage in accordance with paragraph (2)(b)(ii), are to be treated as members of the same household as each other but not of that of any party (or parties) with whom they are not part of a couple in accordance with those provisions and one of them may claim or remain entitled to housing benefit as part of that couple; or
(b)
P who is to be treated as single in accordance with paragraph (2)(a)(i) to (iii), or is single in accordance with paragraph (2)(b)(i), is to be treated as though P is not a member of the same household as any party (or parties) with whom P is not part of a couple in accordance with those provisions and may claim or remain entitled to housing benefit as a single person,
where paragraph (2)(a) applies, with effect from the date on which the relevant paragraph of regulation 3 of the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 first applies to C, or, where paragraph (2)(b) applies, with effect from the date referred to in paragraph (2)(b) on which C lost universal credit entitlement.]

Parliamentary Under Secretary of State
Department for Work and PensionsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into force paragraph 53 of Schedule 2 to the Welfare Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/2006 (N.I. 1)), which amends the State Pension Credit Act (Northern Ireland) 2002 (c.14 (N.I.)) by inserting section 4(1A), which excludes mixed-age couples from entitlement to state pension credit. (For the definition of “mixed-age couple” see Article 2(2)(a).) Section 4(1A) comes into force on 15th May 2019 (“the appointed day”, see Article 3), except in the savings cases in Article 4.
Under Article 4(1), if a member of a mixed-age couple has entitlement to state pension credit or housing benefit for those of state pension credit qualifying age on the day before the appointed day, entitlement as part of that couple may continue after the appointed day. For the definition of entitlement, and entitlement as part of a couple, see Article 2(4).
Under Article 4(2), the savings continue to apply until such time as there is neither entitlement as part of the couple to state pension credit, nor housing benefit for those of state pension credit qualifying age. Provided that there is continuity of entitlement to either benefit, the savings continue. So entitlement to state pension credit, provided as part of the same couple, may arise (or arise again) after the appointed day, so long as there is entitlement on the part of the couple to housing benefit for those of state pension credit qualifying age and there was such entitlement, or entitlement to state pension credit, on the day before the appointed day. Mixed-age couples who do not, or no longer, fall within the savings cases and require income-related benefit may claim universal credit instead.
Articles 5 and 6 make complementary provision to section 4(1A) and the savings in Article 4 in respect of claims to, and awards of, housing benefit for those of state pension credit qualifying age.
Article 5 amends Article 24 of the Welfare Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2015 (Commencement No. 8 and Transitional and Transitory Provisions) Order 2017 (S.R. 2017 No. 190 (C. 11)) to prevent claims to housing benefit by a member of a mixed-age couple of state pension credit qualifying age. Claims are prevented in the same cases as that member is excluded from entitlement to state pension credit, allowing for the savings cases in Article 4(1) whilst they continue under Article 4(2). Further amendment is made to allow claims for housing benefit in respect of temporary accommodation.
Article 6 provides for termination of awards of housing benefit made to a person who has become a member of a mixed-age couple, awards made to a mixed-age couple where the award becomes subject to the Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 (S.R. 2006 No. 406), and advance awards made to a member of a mixed-age couple before the making of this Order. Awards must terminate where entitlement to housing benefit for those of state pension credit qualifying age, as part of a mixed-age couple, would otherwise have begun on or after the appointed day.
Where a party to a polygamous marriage is excluded from state pension credit under section 4(1A) – for the extension of the definition in this Order of “mixed-age couple” to certain polygamous marriages, see Article 2(2)(b) – and may not become or remain entitled to housing benefit for those of state pension credit qualifying age, further to Article 5 or 6 respectively, Article 7(2) provides that the parties to the marriage are to be treated as a couple or as a single person (or persons) as under the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 216). Where each of the parties treated as a couple, or a party treated as single, has attained the qualifying age for state pension credit, Article 7(3) provides that they be treated in that capacity for claims to or awards of state pension credit and housing benefit for those of state pension credit qualifying age.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT ORDERS

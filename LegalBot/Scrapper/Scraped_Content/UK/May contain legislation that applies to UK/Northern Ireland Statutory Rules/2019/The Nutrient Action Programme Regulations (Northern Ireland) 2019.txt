[F1Criteria as to calculation of phosphorus balance
1.—(1) Phosphorus balance is the difference between phosphorus inputs to the holding less the total of phosphorus outputs leaving the holding. It is calculated per unit area of agricultural land on the holding for each calendar year.
(2) Phosphorus inputs include, when imported on to the holding—
(a)
the total amount of phosphorus in chemical fertiliser;
(b)
the total amount of phosphorus in feedstuffs (calculated using values from Table 7); and
(c)
the total amount of phosphorus in organic manure (calculated using values from Table 2).
(3) Phosphorus outputs include, when exported from the holding—
(a)
the total amount of phosphorus in produce, for example, meat, milk and crops (calculated using values from Table 7); and
(b)
the total amount of phosphorus in organic manure (calculated using values from Table 2).
(4) Inputs of phosphorus to agricultural land in precipitation and losses of phosphorus from the holding to any waterway or water contained in any underground strata are excluded from the balance calculation.

SCHEDULE 5
Soil test for Phosphorus
1.  Reference to the results of a soil test is a reference to the results of an analysis of a soil sample carried out by a soil testing laboratory competent to analyse soils for phosphorus. Each analysis, provided by the competent laboratory, will require a UKAS accreditation or (National equivalent) statement.
2.  The taking of soil samples and the analysis for phosphorus shall be carried out in accordance with the procedures below.
Soil sampling procedure
3.  Area to sample: The size of the area from which one sample can be taken varies but shall not be more than four hectares. Generally one sample shall be collected from each field. Within one field, areas which are not uniform for crop growth and areas which have been cropped or fertilised differently shall be sampled separately.
4.  Time of sampling: Sampling every fourth year shall be satisfactory as a basis for phosphorus fertiliser recommendations. A field shall not be sampled for phosphorus until at least three months after the last application of any fertiliser (organic or chemical) containing this nutrient.
5.  Depth of sampling: Grassland shall be sampled to a depth of 75 millimetres and arable land to a depth of 150 millimetres.
6.  Method of sampling: A soil sample shall be made up by bulking at least 25 sub-samples taken from the area to be sampled. The sub-sampling points shall be selected systematically to give an even distribution over the whole sampling area. This distribution shall be achieved by following the pattern of a letter “W” and taking sub-samples at regularly spaced intervals. Taking sub-samples from headland, dung and urine patches, areas where stock gather or other unusual features shall be avoided. Each sub-sample shall be taken using a soil auger which takes an even core of soil throughout the sampling depth. The soil sample shall be stored in a clean, labelled plastic bag.
Soil analysis for phosphorus
7.  The soil test for phosphorus shall be carried out after the soil sample has been air-dried and ground.
8.  Air-drying and grinding soil: The entire soil sample shall be dried to constant weight in an oven with a current of air at a temperature not exceeding 30 °C. Then the whole of the air-dried sample, excluding stones and fibrous material from roots, shall be ground to pass a two millimetre sieve.
9.  Soil analysis for Olsen extractable phosphorus: The measure of phosphorus which is available for crop growth shall be given by the amount extracted from soil at 20 ± 1 °C with a sodium bicarbonate solution of pH 8.5. Details of the analytical procedure are given in The Analysis of Agricultural Materials, Third Edition, pp183-185, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food reference Book 427, 1986. Olsen extractable phosphorus results are expressed as milligrammes phosphorus per litre (mg P/l) of soil, rounded to the nearest whole number.
10.  Classification of soil analysis results into indices: The Olsen extractable phosphorus concentration in soil is classified into an index according to the following scale.
Soil phosphorus index Olsen extractable phosphorus (P) (mg P/l)
0 0 – 9
1 10 – 15

They revoke the Nitrates Action Programme Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 and the Nitrates Action Programme (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015. The also revoke and incorporate the Phosphorus (Use in Agriculture) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014, and regulations 10 and 11 of the Pesticides, genetically modified Organisms and Fertilisers (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2018.
Regulation 2 sets out the purpose and application of the Regulations.
Regulation 4 imposes an obligation on the controller of the holding to prevent water pollution.
Regulation 5 imposes obligations on the controller of a holding in complying with these Regulations to have regard to any guidance issued by the Department and the Code of Good Agricultural Practice.
Regulation 6 prescribes the circumstances in which the Department may grant exemptions to the Regulations.
Regulation 7 establishes periods during which for the land application of chemical fertiliser to grassland, non grassland crops and organic manures, excluding dirty water is prohibited.
Regulation 8 establishes the manner of application and spreading of fertiliser (including dirty water), the minimum distances from waterways, the weight and volume of solid organic manure and slurry that may be applied and the period of time left between applications. It also regulates the use of low emission slurry spreading equipment in certain circumstances.
Regulations 9, 10 and 11 limit the land application of nitrogen form livestock manure to 170kg N/ha/yr and sets limits for the amount of chemical fertiliser and organic manures that may be applied in relation to crop requirement for nitrogen for grass and other crops. These limits are currently calculated by using values set out in AHDB Nutrient Management Guide (RB209) January 2019 and the Schedules to these Regulations. Regulation 9 also allows for a scientific case to be presented to deviate from the values set out in Tables 1a to 2 of Schedule 2 in respect of nitrogen excretion values, and total nitrogen content of fertilisers.
Regulation 12 which applies from 1st January 2020, introduces measures governing the land application of anaerobic digestate, including a requirement for a fertilisation plan to be kept if anaerobic digestate is applied to the land.
Regulation 13 restricts the amount of chemical phosphorus fertiliser applied to the land to crop requirement for phosphorus whilst taking into consideration the phosphorus already available from the soil and organic manures. These variables are to be calculated in accordance with Schedules 3 and 5 to these Regulations. It introduces the requirement for a fertilisation plan to be kept where chemical phosphorus fertiliser is applied to grassland.
Regulation 14 establishes limits for the land application of organic manures containing greater than a specified proportion of phosphorus compared to nitrogen. It also introduces the requirement for a fertilisation plan to be kept this type of organic manure is applied to the land.
Regulation 15 introduces measures governing the location of supplementary feeding sites which applies from 1st January 2020 and from 1st January 2022 livestock drinking points where there is a significant risk of pollution to a waterway.
Regulation 16 prescribes the requirements to be complied with where a controller is required to prepare and retain a fertilisation plan.

Regulation 18 further details the livestock manure storage capacity required for different types of enterprises.
Regulations 19 to 22 prescribe how slurry, farmyard manure, poultry litter, anaerobic digestate fibre and dirty water are to be stored.
Regulation 21 applies to the location and storage of anaerobic digestate fibre from 1st January 2020.
Regulation 23 sets out how to calculate storage capacity and on-farm practices, including out-wintering livestock (other than dairy cows), that may be taken into account when calculating such capacity.
Regulation 24 prescribes how silage, or any crop being made into silage is to be stored.
Regulations 25 and 26 prescribe soil cover and detail crop management in order to minimise soil erosion and nutrient run-off.
Regulation 27 imposes an obligation on the controller of a holding to keep sufficient records for a holding to ascertain the identity of the controller, the total agricultural area, the crop regime for individual areas within the holding, the results of soil phosphorus tests, quantity and type of phosphorus fertiliser applied and the date of application, a statement of foreseeable crop requirements where necessary, the quantity and date of application of anaerobic digestate applied to the land, the nutrient content analysis of the anaerobic digestate, the number of livestock, the livestock manure storage capacity and storage arrangements and the quantity of nitrogen fertiliser moved on and off the holding. These records must be ready for inspection and held for 5 years. Records concerning the movement of livestock manure off holding must be submitted annually to the Department.
Regulation 28 prescribes that the records must be accurate and not misleading.
Regulation 29 establishes the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as the enforcement authority and its authority to carry out these functions in accordance with the Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern Ireland) Order 1997.
Regulation 30 prescribes how the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs may serve a notice to minimise the risk of water pollution from storage of farm effluents or if any appropriate person is in breach of the Regulations and the requirements to be met when the notice is served.
Regulation 31 creates the right of appeal to the Appeals Commission against any notice issued under regulation 30 and provides procedures for an appeal against a refusal for a deviation under regulation 9.
Regulations 32 sets out offences under the Regulations and regulation 33 provides for penalties.
Regulation 34 establishes the duty on the Department to submit, a four-yearly report on the implementation of the Regulations.
Regulation 35 imposes a duty on the Department to review the action programme, through a consultative process, every four years.
Regulation 36 deems notices served under regulation 28 of the Nitrates Action Programme Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 and regulation 9 of the Phosphorus (Use in Agriculture) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 to be notices under these Regulations and the records to be retained under regulation 25 of the Nitrates Action Programme (Northern Ireland) 2014 and regulation 7 of the Phosphorus (Use in Agriculture) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014, to be types of records required under these Regulations, from the date in which these Regulations come into operation.
Regulation 37 makes consequential amendments to the Waste Management and Licensing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003 and the Common Agricultural Policy Direct Payments and Support Schemes (Cross Compliance) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 to maintain consistency with these Regulations.
Regulation 38 provides for the revocation of a number of statutory provisions consequent upon the coming into operation of these Regulations. However, it saves the provisions of Table 1a of Schedule 1 to the Nitrates Action Programme Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 until 31st December 2019.

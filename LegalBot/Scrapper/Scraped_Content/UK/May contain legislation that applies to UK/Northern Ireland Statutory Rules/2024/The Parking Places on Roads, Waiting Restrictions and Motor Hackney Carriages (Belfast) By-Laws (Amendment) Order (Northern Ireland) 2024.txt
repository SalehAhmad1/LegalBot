The Department for Infrastructure(a) makes the following Order in exercise of the powers 
conferred by Articles 4(1), (2) and (3), 10(4), 13(1), 15(1) and 27A(1) of the Road Traffic

for vehicles on lengths of Glengall Street, Belfast. 
The Department has consulted such persons as it considered appropriate in compliance with 
Articles 4(6), 10(7) and 27A(3) and paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedules 1, 4 and 4A to the Road 
Traffic Regulation (Northern Ireland) Order 1997. 
The Department has published a notice in compliance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of those Schedules. 
The Department, in compliance with paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 4 to that Order, has taken such 
other steps as appear to the Department reasonably practicable for the purpose of bringing 
specifically to the knowledge of the occupiers of land adjacent to the parking places the particulars 
specified in paragraph 3(2) of that Schedule. 
No written objection has been received and one representation has been received.

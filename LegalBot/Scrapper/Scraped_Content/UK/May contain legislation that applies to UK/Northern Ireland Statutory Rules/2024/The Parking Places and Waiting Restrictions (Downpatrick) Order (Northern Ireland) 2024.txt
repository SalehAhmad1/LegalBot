The Department for Infrastructure(a) makes the following Order in exercise of the powers 
conferred by Articles 4(1), (2) and (3) and 10(4) and 13(1) (13) and (16) of the Road Traffic

It appears to the Department to be necessary to provide suitable parking places for vehicles on the 
lengths of road as specified in Schedule 1 to this Order. 
The Department has consulted such persons as it considered appropriate in compliance with 
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedules 1 and 4 to the Road Traffic Regulation (Northern Ireland) Order 
1997. 
The Department has published a notice in compliance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of those Schedules. 
The Department in compliance with paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 4 to that Order has taken such 
other steps as appear to the Department reasonably practicable for the purpose of bringing 
specifically to the knowledge of occupiers of land adjacent to the parking places the particulars 
specified in paragraph 3(2) of that Schedule. 
No objection or other representation has been received.

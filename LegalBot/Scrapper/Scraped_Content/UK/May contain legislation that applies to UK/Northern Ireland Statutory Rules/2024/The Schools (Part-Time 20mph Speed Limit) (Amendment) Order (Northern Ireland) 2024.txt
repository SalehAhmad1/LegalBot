EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Order) 
This Order amends The Schools (Part-Time 20mph Speed Limit) Order (Northern Ireland) 2018 
(“the 2018 Order”) by extending the length of an existing part-time speed limit on a length of

The Order permits the current speed limit on this length of road to be reduced to 20 miles per hour 
when a 20 miles per hour limit is indicated by a traffic sign.

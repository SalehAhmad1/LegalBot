A senior officer of the Department for CommunitiesEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and re-enact the provisions of the Child Support Fees (Revocation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of section 36(4) of the Child Maintenance Act (Northern Ireland) 2008. These Regulations amend the Child Support Fees Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 so as to revoke regulation 3(6) and (7).
The Child Support Collection (Domestic Abuse) Act 2023 (c. 24) makes broader provision for collect and pay arrangements in child support. Regulation 3(6) and (7) of the 2014 Regulations is thereby revoked by regulation 2 to these regulations.
Regulation 3 revokes the Child Support Fees (Revocation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

The Department has published a notice in compliance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of that Schedule. 
The Department in compliance with paragraph 3(4) of that Schedule, has taken such other steps as 
appear to the Department reasonably practicable for the purpose of bringing specifically to the 
knowledge of the occupiers of land adjacent to the parking places the particulars specified in 
paragraph 3(2) of that Schedule. 
Four objections have been received and no other representations have been received. 
The Department has modified the draft Order.

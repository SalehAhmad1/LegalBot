(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends the provisions in the Coronavirus Act 2020 (c. 7) (the “2020 Act”) which allow a coroner to hold an inquest into a death in prison caused by natural illness without a jury and which provide for courts and statutory tribunals in Northern Ireland to receive evidence, wholly or in part, through the use of audio or video live links.
Article 2 extends the operation of section 32 of the Act for nearly six months after the period of time provided for by section 89 (1) of the 2020 Act, so that a coroner can hold (or continue to hold) an inquest into a death in prison caused by natural illness without a jury until 24 September 2022.
Article 3 extends the period of time provided by section 89 (1) of the 2020 Act for nearly 6 months so that the wider and extended use of video or audio live links by all or any courts or a statutory tribunal (Part 1 of Schedule 27) and the provisions which facilitate public participation in legal proceedings where live links are being used while protecting those proceedings from unauthorised recordings or transmission (Part 2 of Schedule 27) can continue until the 24 September 2022.

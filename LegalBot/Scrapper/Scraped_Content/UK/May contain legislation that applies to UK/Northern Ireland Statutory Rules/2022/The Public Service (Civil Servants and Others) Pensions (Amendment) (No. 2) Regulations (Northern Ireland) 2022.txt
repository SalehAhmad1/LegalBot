whose ill-health pension application is determined on or after the transition date; and

M would have met a payment threshold in the PCSPS(NI) and M meets the equivalent payment threshold in this scheme, the annual rate of ill-health pension payable under this scheme in respect of the payment threshold is the greater of—

(ii)
the rate which would have been payable to M under the PCSPS(NI) in respect of that payment threshold; or
(b)
M would have met a payment threshold in the PCSPS(NI) and M does not meet the equivalent payment threshold in this scheme, the annual rate of ill-health pension payable under this scheme in respect of the payment threshold is the rate which would have been payable to M under the PCSPS(NI) in respect of that payment threshold.

(b)
where M does not meet a payment threshold in this scheme, the rate which would have been payable to M under the PCSPS(NI).

(6) Any rate or amount payable under this paragraph which is determined by reference to a rate or an amount that would have been payable under the PCSPS(NI) is subject to the same conditions, and ceases to be payable in the same circumstances, as the rate or amount which would have been payable under the PCSPS(NI) in accordance with the rules of that scheme.
(7) The following provisions of the PCSPS(NI) apply in relation to a transition member with continuity of service who is receiving payment of an ill-health pension in accordance with this paragraph as they apply in relation to such a member who is receiving payment of an ill-health pension in accordance with paragraph 29—
(a)
rule N.9 of Section I;
(b)
rule 18.13 of Section II;
(c)
rule M.9 of Section III.
(8) In this paragraph—
(a)
the question of whether M would have met a payment threshold in the PCSPS(NI) is the question of whether M would have met the lower tier payment threshold or the upper tier payment threshold in the PCSPS(NI) if their ill-health pension application had been determined on 31st March 2022;
(b)
M only meets a payment threshold in this scheme if, in addition to meeting the criteria for that threshold, M would be entitled to payment of an ill-health pension under this scheme (disregarding this paragraph);
(c)
a reference to an amount or a rate which would have been payable to M under the PCSPS(NI) is a reference to the amount or the rate which would have been payable to M under the PCSPS(NI) if their ill health application had been determined on 31st March 2022;
(d)
terms which are defined for the purpose of paragraph 29 have the same meaning as in that paragraph.”.Sealed with the Official Seal of the Department of Finance on 18th March 2022

Department of FinanceEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend The Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”) (S.R. 2014 No. 290). The 2014 Regulations established a scheme for the payment of pensions and other benefits to civil servants and other eligible persons (“the alpha scheme”).
As part of the 2015 pension reforms, those members of the civil service (defined benefit) pension schemes who were within 10 years of their Normal Pension Age (NPA) on 31 March 2012 and who had active status at that point and on 1 April 2015 remained in the appropriate Section of the PCSPS(NI); this was referred to as transitional protection. In December 2018, the Court of Appeal found that this part of the reforms unlawfully discriminated against younger members of the judicial and firefighters’ pension schemes in particular, as transitional protection was only offered to older scheme members. The courts required that this unlawful discrimination be remedied by the Government. In July 2019, the Government confirmed that it accepted that the Court of Appeal’s judgment had implications for the other public service schemes that had similar transitional arrangements, including the Civil Service Pension Arrangements.
The Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7) (“the 2022 Act”) calls for all civil servants who continue in service from 1 April 2022 onwards to do so as members of alpha. The legacy PCSPS(NI) will be closed in relation to service after 31 March 2022, closing the remedy period, during which members in scope have a choice of benefits. This is known as the prospective remedy.
These Regulations make the amendments required to implement the prospective remedy, which requires moving all active members of the PCSPS(NI) (including partial retirees in active service) to alpha on 1 April 2022 and making consequential changes to the regulations, pursuant to the requirements of the 2022 Act.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 121 to clarify that payment of a lump sum death benefit is discretionary. This will bring alpha provisions into line with existing practice, the PCSPS(NI) and other public service pension schemes, and will achieve the intended effect in relation to inheritance tax. This amendment is not considered to have an adverse effect on members.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 173 of the 2014 Regulations to bring provisions about the time when information about the payment of the annual allowance charge into line with the provisions of regulation 14A of the Registered Pension Schemes (Provision of Information) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/567).
Regulation 5 amends Schedule 1 to the 2014 Regulations to allow certain transition members to exercise an option to make a lump sum payment for added pension.
Regulation 6 amends Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations for the following purposes—
paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (9) make amendments in consequence of provision made by the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7). The amendments ensure that the existing Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (Northern Ireland) (“the PCSPS(NI)”) established under Article 3 of the Superannuation (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 (1972 No. 1073 (N.I. 10)) will be closed to future service accrual on and after 1st April 2022, and that any members currently in pensionable service under the PCSPS(NI) will, on that date, begin accruing benefits in alpha. In particular—
the definitions of “closing date” and “transition date” in paragraph 1 are amended to insert dates in respect of those terms that apply to full protection members so that provisions which refer to those terms operate as intended in respect of such members;
paragraph 3(3) is amended so that the tapered protection closing date for certain tapered protection members cannot be determined by the scheme manager to be on or after 1st April 2022;
paragraph 9(2) is amended so that protection ceases for a full protection member on the earlier of the day on which they leave pensionable service under the PCSPS(NI), or 31st March 2022;
new paragraph 29B is inserted to ensure that members of the PCSPS(NI) who make an application for ill-health pension on or before 31st March 2022 which is not determined on or before that date receive no less generous ill-health benefits than they would have received had the application been determined on that date;
paragraphs (5) to (8) make (in reliance in particular on section 3(3)(b) of the Public Service Pensions Act (Northern Ireland) 2014 (2014 c. 2 (N.I.))) retrospective amendments to paragraphs 16, 17, 25 and 26 of Schedule 2 to bring certain Fair Deal members within the scope of transitional protection.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this Statutory Rule as no impact on the costs of business or the voluntary sector is foreseen.

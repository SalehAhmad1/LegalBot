(8) A search under a warrant may only be a search to the extent required for the purpose for which the warrant was issued.

that investigation;
(b)
the investigating of an offence; or
(c)
any criminal proceedings (including proceedings related to the making of a confiscation order) or any proceedings under Chapter 2, 3, 3A, or 3B of Part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 which may be brought as a result of—

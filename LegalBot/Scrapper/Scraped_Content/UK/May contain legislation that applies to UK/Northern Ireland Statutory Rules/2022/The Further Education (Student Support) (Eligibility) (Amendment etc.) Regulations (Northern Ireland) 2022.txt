(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Further Education (Student Support) (Eligibility) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2012 (S.R. 2012 No.306).
The amendments made by regulations 2 to 5 remove the grace period provisions as the grace period has now ended for the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) and further ensure that the Regulations fully reflect the requirements of the EU Withdrawal Agreement (and the EEA EFTA Separation Agreement and Swiss Citizens’ Rights Agreement) as they relate to the rights of those making late applications to the EUSS and to joining family members who have yet to apply to the EUSS and are still within the deadline for doing so.
Regulations 6 to 7 amend the 2012 Regulations so that persons granted leave under one of the Afghan Schemes (the Afghan Citizens’ Resettlement Scheme or the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy Scheme) and their spouse, civil partner or dependent child may qualify for support under each of those rules.
Regulations 8 to 9 amend the 2012 Regulations for new courses which begin on or after 1st August 2022 so that British nationals evacuated or assisted from Afghanistan become eligible for support.
Regulations 10 to 11 amend the 2012 Regulations so that persons under the Ukraine Schemes (Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme, Ukraine Family Scheme and Ukraine Extension Scheme) become eligible for support for new and existing courses from the beginning of academic year 2022/23.

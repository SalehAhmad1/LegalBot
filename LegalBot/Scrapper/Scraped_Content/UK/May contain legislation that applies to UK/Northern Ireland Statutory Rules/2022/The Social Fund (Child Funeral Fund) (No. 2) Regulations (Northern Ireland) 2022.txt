(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations establish the Child Funeral Fund (CFF) as part of the social fund. The CFF will provide a one-off lump sum payment of £3056.00 towards the funeral costs of children below the age of 18 and still-born children born after 24 weeks’ gestation. Payment is non-means tested.
Regulation 1 provides that the Regulations come into operation on 1st June 2022.
Regulation 3 defines the circumstances in which a claimant may be entitled to a payment from the CFF in relation to a funeral. The payment must be in relation to a funeral of a child who had not yet attained the age of 18, or was still-born after the 24th week of gestation, where the funeral takes place in Northern Ireland or the burial or cremation or the erection of a memorial takes place in the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland, on or after 1st June 2022.
Regulation 4 prohibits payments for which money has been paid out under the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 (S.R. 2005 No. 506) or under regulations made under section 34 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (asp 9) or under the Social Fund (Children’s Funeral Fund for England) Regulations 2019 (S.R. 2019 No. 1064)
Regulation 5 amends the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 to prevent double payment for which the claimant has already received payment from the CFF.
Regulation 6 amends the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1987 to amend the definition of “social fund funeral payment” to include those made under the CFF.
Regulation 7 revokes the Social Fund (Child Funeral Fund) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022 (S.R. 2022 No. 165)
A regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as they have no impact on the costs of the business.

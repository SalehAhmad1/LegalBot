A senior officer of the Department for CommunitiesEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations replace the Social Fund (Applications and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008 (“the 2008 Regulations”) (S.R. 2008 No. 357), which are revoked, and reflect the fact that budgeting loans are the only remaining element of social fund payments made under section 134(1)(b) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992.
Regulations 2 and 3 set out the manner and form in which applications are to be made for payments by way of budgeting loan out of the social fund.
Regulation 4 provides for consent to be given where someone else is making the application on the applicant’s behalf.
Regulation 5 sets out when an application for a budgeting loan is treated as having been made.
Regulation 6 specifies conditions which must be satisfied before payments of budgeting loans are made. A change from the 2008 Regulations is that agreement to the repayment terms and conditions does not need to be in writing.
Regulation 7 specifies the circumstances in which an award of a budgeting loan becomes extinguished.
Regulation 8 revokes the 2008 Regulations and the Social Fund (Applications and Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 (S.R. 2009 No. 392) which amended the 2008 Regulations.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992, are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.

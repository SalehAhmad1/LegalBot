DepartmentEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Mines Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No.427) (“the 2016 Regulations”). They make provision to implement Directive (EU) 2017/2398, of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 amending Directive 2004/37/EC on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (OJ No. L345, 27.12.2017, p. 87-95), in relation to coal mine workers in Northern Ireland.
Regulation 2(2) substitutes a new definition of “action level” in regulation 2(1) of the 2016 Regulations in order to remove the reference to respirable crystalline silica.
Regulation 2(3) omits regulation 44 of the 2016 Regulations so that the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003 (S.R. 2003 No. 34) apply to respirable crystalline silica dust below ground in coal mines.
Regulation 2(4) amends regulation 45 of the 2016 Regulations to remove all references to respirable crystalline silica.
A regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

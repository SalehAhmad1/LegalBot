(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Teachers’ Pension Scheme Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 (No. 310) (“the 2014 Regulations”) in consequence of provision made by the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022. The amendments ensure that the existing pension scheme established by the Teachers’ Superannuation Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1998 (No. 333) will, except for limited purposes, be closed to the accrual of pension benefits on and after 1st April 2022, and that any members currently treated as being in pensionable service under the existing pension scheme will, on that date, begin accruing benefits in the scheme established by the 2014 Regulations.
Regulation 2 amends Schedule 3 to the 2014 Regulations as follows—
paragraph 1 is amended to include a new definition, “final salary benefits”, and the definition of “transition date” has been expanded to include a date for full protection members so that provisions which refer to that term operate as intended in respect of such members;
paragraph 5(3) is amended to expand the definition of “continuity of service” to include a date for full protection members so that provisions which refer to that term operate as intended in respect of such members;
paragraph 6(2) is amended so that protection ceases for a full protection member on the earlier of the day on which they leave pensionable service under the existing scheme, or 31st March 2022;
paragraphs 22(3) and 24(5) are amended in relation to transfer into the existing scheme;
paragraph 26(3) is amended in relation to elections for the purchase of additional pension made by full protection members.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations prohibit fishing for sea-fish by demersal mobile and static fishing gear in the waters in a number of marine protected areas which were designated under The Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1995 and the Marine Act (Northern Ireland) 2013.
Regulation 3 prohibits fishing within the respective marine protected areas using demersal fishing gear and static fishing gear.
Regulation 4 provides for exceptions to the prohibitions in regulation 3.
Regulation 5 revokes some Statutory Rules as a consequence of the Regulations.
Contravention of these Regulations is an offence under section 124(3) of the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. The penalty on summary conviction is a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale (£5,000).

A senior officer of the Department for CommunitiesEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 21 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 (“the Act”) contains provisions modifying certain requirements regarding medical certificates for cremations.
Section 89(1) provides for the Act to expire at the end of the period of 2 years beginning with the day on which it was passed (25 March 2020). This is subject to limited exceptions, including section 21(7). Section 90 allows expiring provisions to be extended for not more than 6 months.
The Coronavirus Act 2020 (Extension of Modifications of Requirements Regarding Medical Certificates for Cremations) Order (Northern Ireland) 2022 (S.R. 2022 No. 130) extended the expiry date of section 21(1) to (6) to 24 September 2022, but that Order has not been approved by the Assembly. The Department, however, wishes to ensure that section 21(1) to (6) is extended to 24 September 2022 and so makes this Order. The making of this Order renders the continued operation of S.R. 2022 No. 130 unnecessary and so that Order is revoked by this Order.

The Department for Infrastructure(a) makes the following Order in exercise of the powers 
conferred by Article 69(1)(a) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993(b) and now vested in 
it(c). 
The Department considers that the use of a private means of access from the road specified in the 
Schedule is likely to cause danger to, or interfere unreasonably with, traffic on that road. 
The Department, in accordance with Article 69(2)(b) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993, 
is of the opinion that another road is available which provides alternative facilities for road traffic. 
Notice has been published and served in compliance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 5 to 
that Order. 
No objection has been received. 
Citation and commencement

Order (Northern Ireland) 2022 and shall come into operation on 16th November 2022.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Social Security (Habitual Residence and Past Presence) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022 (S.R. 2022 No. 149) (“the principal Regulations”) enable certain persons to access both income-related benefits and disability and carers benefits upon arrival in Northern Ireland from Ukraine provided they meet the other relevant entitlement conditions.
These Regulations make further amendments so that persons who do not require leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom in accordance with section 3ZA of the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77) but who would not fall within the categories already listed in the principal Regulations, notably Irish citizens, may access income-related benefits (regulation 2) and disability and carers benefits (regulation 3) upon arrival in Northern Ireland from Ukraine.
Regulation 1 provides for citation and commencement.
Regulation 2 amends the Income Support (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1987, the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1996, the State Pension Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003, the Housing Benefit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006, the Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006, the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008 and the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 – the income-related benefit regulations.
Regulation 3 amends the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1976, the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1992 and the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1992 and the Personal Independence Payment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 – the disability and carers benefit regulations.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992, are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.

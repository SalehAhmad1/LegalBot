(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 17 of the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014, which concerns the provision of annual pension benefit statements, to require certain pension schemes to provide members (except pensioner members), who are entitled to money purchase benefits, with a statement in relation to those benefits that must not exceed one double-sided sheet of A4-sized paper when printed. They make provision for an exception where the member requests the information in an alternative format. The trustees or managers are required to have regard to guidance on the layout and content of the statement published from time to time by the Department for Communities.

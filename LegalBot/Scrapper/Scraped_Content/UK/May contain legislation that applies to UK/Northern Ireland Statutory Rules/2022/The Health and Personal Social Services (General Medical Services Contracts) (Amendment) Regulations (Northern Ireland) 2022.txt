These Regulations amend the Health and Personal Social Services (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2004 (“the principal Regulations”) to reflect changes to the arrangements for independent prescribing by chiropodists and podiatrists, optometrists, paramedics, physiotherapists and therapeutic radiographers. There will be new categories of prescribers known as Chiropodist or Podiatrist Independent Prescriber, Optometrist Independent Prescriber, Paramedic Independent Prescriber, Physiotherapist Independent Prescriber and Therapeutic Radiographer Independent Prescriber. These Regulations insert definitions of the new categories of independent prescriber and a definition of independent prescriber into the principal Regulations. They also amend the definition of supplementary prescriber to include dietitians and paramedics.

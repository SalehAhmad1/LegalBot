(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order designates countries and territories under Article 19D(2)(b), (2A) and (2B) of the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 as making satisfactory provision for the grant of certain classes of driving licences. This enables those driving licences to be exchanged for a corresponding Northern Ireland licence.
This Order revokes and replaces the Motor Vehicles (Exchangeable Licences) Order (Northern Ireland) 2009 (S.R. 2009 No. 302).
The designations in respect of the countries and territories specified in Table 1 (with the exception of Andorra) and of the Republic of Korea and of the Faroe Islands in Table 3 replace earlier designations in order to reflect changes to vehicle categories and sub-categories that took effect from 19th January 2013. Andorra is now designated to the same extent as those countries and territories specified in Table 1.
Article 4 and Table 2 designate the Cayman Islands and the United Arab Emirates in respect of licences which authorise the driving of cars, small goods vehicles, vehicle combinations up to 3500kg maximum authorised mass, smaller motorcycles, mopeds, tractors, pedestrian controlled vehicles and mowing machines. Those licences can be exchanged if the driving test was passed in any of those newly designated countries or territories or was granted by them in exchange for a licence granted in an EEA State, the United Kingdom, any other country or territory specified in Table 2, a country or territory specified in Table 1 or in a country or territory specified in Schedule 2, where the driving test was passed in that country, territory or State.
The Cayman Islands and the United Arab Emirates are also designated in respect of licences which authorise the driving of larger mopeds and smaller motorcycles which were granted in a country or territory specified in Table 3 by way of exchange for a licence granted in an EEA State, the United Kingdom, a country or territory specified in Table 1 or Table 2 or in a country or territory specified in Schedule 2, where the driving test for that category of vehicle was passed in that country, territory or State.
Article 5 and Table 3 designate the Republic of North Macedonia, Taiwan and Ukraine in respect of licences which authorise the driving of cars, small goods vehicles, vehicle combinations up to 3500kg maximum authorised mass, smaller mopeds, tractors, pedestrian controlled vehicles and mowing machines. Those licences can be exchanged if the driving test was passed in one of those newly designated countries or territories or was granted by them in exchange for a licence granted in an EEA State, the United Kingdom, any other country or territory specified in Table 3, a country or territory specified in Table 1 or Table 2 or in a country or territory specified in Schedule 2, where the driving test was passed in that country, territory or State.
The Republic of North Macedonia, Taiwan and Ukraine are also designated in respect of licences which authorise the driving of larger mopeds and motorcycles which were granted in a country or territory specified in Table 3 by way of exchange for a licence granted in an EEA State, the United Kingdom, a country or territory specified in Table 1 or in a country or territory specified in Schedule 2, where the driving test for that category of vehicle was passed in that country, territory or State.
The Republic of North Macedonia, Taiwan and Ukraine are also designated in respect of licences which authorise the driving of larger mopeds and smaller motorcycles which were granted in a country or territory specified in Table 3 by way of exchange for a licence granted in an EEA State, the United Kingdom, a country or territory specified in Table 2 or in a country or territory specified in Schedule 2, where the driving test for that category of vehicle was passed in that country, territory or State.
Article 6 designates Switzerland in respect of licences authorising the driving of large goods vehicles and large buses (with or without a trailer). Those licences can be exchanged if the driving test was passed in Switzerland or the licence was granted in exchange for a licence granted in an EEA State, Great Britain, Gibraltar or in a country or territory specified in Schedule 2, where the driving test was passed in that country, territory or State.
In the case of all of the above designations if the licence was granted to a person who has passed a driving test in a vehicle with automatic transmission the licence shall only be exchangeable to the extent that it authorises the driving of vehicles with automatic transmission.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Occupational Pension Schemes (Fraud Compensation Levy) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 to set out the maximum fraud compensation levy that may be raised in any one financial year. They set out a maximum fraud compensation levy of 65 pence per member for Master Trust schemes and £1.80 per member for all other occupational pension schemes.
The fraud compensation levy is paid by occupational pension schemes and is used to fund the Fraud Compensation Fund, which makes payments to certain schemes that have lost money as a consequence of fraud.
As these Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain, the requirement to consult under Article 289(1) of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 does not apply by virtue of paragraph (2)(e) of that Article.

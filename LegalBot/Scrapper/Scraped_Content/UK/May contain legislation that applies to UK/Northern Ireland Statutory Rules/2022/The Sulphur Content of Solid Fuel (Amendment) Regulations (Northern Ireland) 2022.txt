(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 11 of, and paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The Regulations make amendments to the legislation in the field of air quality to remedy any failure of retained EU law to operate effectively.
Regulation 2 makes technical updating amendments to the Sulphur Content of Solid Fuel Regulation (Northern Ireland) 1998 by substituting a new British Standard for the determination of the total sulphur content.

The Department for Infrastructure(a) makes the following Order in exercise of the powers 
conferred by Article 69(1) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993(b) and now vested in it(c). 
The Department considers that the use of private means of access from the road specified in 
column (2) of Schedule 1 to the land described in relation thereto in column (3) of that Schedule 
and three private means of access from the roads specified in column (2) of Schedule 2 to the 
lands described in relation thereto in column (3) of that Schedule are likely to cause danger to, or 
interfere unreasonably with, traffic on those roads. 
The Department, in accordance with Article 69(2)(a) of that Order, is satisfied that access from the 
roads to the lands specified in Schedule 1 is not reasonably required. 
The Department, in accordance with Article 69(2)(b) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993, 
is satisfied that other reasonably convenient means of access to the land specified in Schedule 2 
will be provided. 
Notice has been published and served in compliance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 5 to 
that Order. 
One objection has been received and duly considered.

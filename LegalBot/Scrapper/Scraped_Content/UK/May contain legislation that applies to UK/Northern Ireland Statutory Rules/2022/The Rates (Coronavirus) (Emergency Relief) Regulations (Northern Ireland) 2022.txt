(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for emergency rate relief in respect of specified hereditaments for April 2022. The relief is being provided in order to provide support to businesses as a result of the threat to public health from the virus known as Coronavirus or “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, which causes the disease known as “COVID-19”.
Regulation 3 removes rates liability that arises for specified hereditaments between 1st April 2022 and 30th April 2022.
Regulation 4 allows for the removal of liability under regulation 3 to apply to the NAV element of a mixed hereditament that appears on the non-domestic valuation list.
Regulation 5 provides that where rates are payable by the owner rather than the occupier of a business hereditament, the reduction of rates is conditional on the owner applying the amount of the reduction for the benefit of the occupier.
Regulation 6 makes provision to ensure that any reduction to rates liability provided under these Regulations is applied after any reduction in liability provided under the Rates (Small Business Hereditament Relief) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 (S.R. 2010 No. 4) as amended.
Regulation 7 makes provision to ensure that any reduction to rates liability provided under these Regulations is applied after any reduction in the rates liability for that hereditament due to it being distinguished in the NAV list as a result of Article 43(1) of the Rates (Northern Ireland) Order 1977.
Regulation 8 permits a person, in respect of whom a reduction under regulation 3 is applied, to make application to the Department to have that reduction disregarded.
The Schedule to the Regulations provides for what will constitute an excepted hereditament for the purposes of the Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 44 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 (“the Act”) contains provision relating to Statutory Sick Pay.
Section 89(1) provides for the Act to expire at the end of the period of 2 years beginning with the day on which it was passed (25th March 2020). This is subject to limited exceptions. Section 90 allows expiring provisions to be extended for not more than 6 months.
The Coronavirus Act 2020 (Extension of Provisions Relating to Statutory Sick Pay) Order (Northern Ireland) 2022 (S.R. 2022 No. 151) extended the expiry date of section 44 to 24th September 2022, but that Order has not been approved by the Assembly. The Department, however, wishes to ensure that section 44 is extended to 24th September 2022 and so makes this Order. The making of this Order renders the continued operation of S.R. 2022 No. 151 unnecessary and so that Order is revoked by this Order.

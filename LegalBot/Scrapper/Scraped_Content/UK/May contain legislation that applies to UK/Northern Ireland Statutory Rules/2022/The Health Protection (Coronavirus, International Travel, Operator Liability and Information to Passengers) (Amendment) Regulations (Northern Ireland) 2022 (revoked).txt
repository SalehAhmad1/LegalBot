(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 and The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Operator Liability and Information to Passengers) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021.
The main changes made by these Regulations are to the rules that apply to eligible non-red list arrivals, i.e. those arrivals to Northern Ireland who are fully vaccinated upon arrival.
Regulation 4 removes the requirement for these people to have a negative test result before they arrive in Northern Ireland.
Regulations 5 and 6 change the rules on booking a covid test before arrival in Northern Ireland for these people. They must have booked a day 2 test before they arrive in Northern Ireland. That test can be a lateral flow test. If that test is negative, there are no further restrictions upon them. However, if the test is positive or inconclusive, they must self-isolate for 10 days. If the test is positive, they must also take a further PCR test. If the test is inconclusive, they may take a further PCR test. If the further PCR test is negative, they can leave self-isolation with no further restrictions.
Regulation 7 supplements the enforcement and information sharing regime to ensure that there are powers to deal with those who do not comply with these rule changes.
Regulation 8 changes the rules on self-isolation for these people. There is no obligation to self-isolate upon arrival. But this is subject to the rules in regulations 5 and 6 on what happens if they get a positive result on their day 2 test.
Regulation 9 updates the list of recognised vaccines and countries.
Regulation 10 updates the information that must be given to passengers travelling to Northern Ireland.
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

Department for InfrastructureEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Motor Vehicle Testing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”) to exempt vehicles of historical interest to Northern Ireland from periodic roadworthiness testing.
They facilitate the implementation of Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3rd April 2014 (OJ L 127, 29. 4. 2014, p51 – 128) on periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers which permits Member States to exempt vehicles that meet certain conditions from the testing requirements.
The Regulations amend regulation 6 of the 2003 Regulations to provide an exemption for vehicles of historical interest, being vehicles manufactured or first registered at least 40 years previously, which are no longer in production and have been historically preserved or maintained in their original state with no substantial changes in the technical characteristics of their main components.

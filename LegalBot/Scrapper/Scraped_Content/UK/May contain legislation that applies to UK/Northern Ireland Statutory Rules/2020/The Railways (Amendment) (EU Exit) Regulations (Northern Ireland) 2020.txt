(This note is not part of the Order)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act to make consequential amendments and under section 11 of, and paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraphs 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (“the Act”) in order to address a failure of retained EU law to operate effectively and arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends The Rail Safety (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 to omit regulation 10, thus enabling the Department for Infrastructure to implement the requirements of Regulation (EC) 2018/763 which has become applicable in the UK during the transition period.
Regulation 3 amends The Railways (Safety Management) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 to amend a definition as a consequence of Directive EU 2016/798 and to apply consequential amendments in consequence of the Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2011.

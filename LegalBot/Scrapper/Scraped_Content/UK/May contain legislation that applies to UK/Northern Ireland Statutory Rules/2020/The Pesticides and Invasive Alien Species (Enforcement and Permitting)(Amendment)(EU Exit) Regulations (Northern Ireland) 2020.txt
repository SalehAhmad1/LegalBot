(This note is not part of the Order)
These Regulations are made in the exercise of powers in section 11 of, and Part 1C of Schedule 2 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. They ensure that Northern Ireland legislation relating to Invasive Alien Species and Pesticides can continue to operate effectively after the EU exit transition period and remain aligned with the EU law in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. In relation to Invasive Alien Species, omitting regulation 9 of S.I. 2019 No. 1313 effectively restores the definition of “Union List” in S.R. 2019 No. 159.
These Regulations also revoke certain provisions contained in EU Exit Statutory Instruments that are no longer relevant.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

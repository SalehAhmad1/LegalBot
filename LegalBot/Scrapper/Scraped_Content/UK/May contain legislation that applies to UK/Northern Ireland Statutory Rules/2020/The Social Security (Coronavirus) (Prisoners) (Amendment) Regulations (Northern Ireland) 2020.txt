(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Coronavirus) (Prisoners) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (S.R. 2020 No. 63) in response to the continuing outbreak of coronavirus in Northern Ireland.
Those Regulations made provision to enable individuals on temporary release from prison due to the outbreak of coronavirus in Northern Ireland to access means tested benefits during the period of that release.
Following a review by the Department of the operation of the Social Security (Coronavirus) (Prisoners) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020, regulation 2 amends the provision by which those Regulations expire after 8 months so that they now expire 14 months after they came into operation.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.

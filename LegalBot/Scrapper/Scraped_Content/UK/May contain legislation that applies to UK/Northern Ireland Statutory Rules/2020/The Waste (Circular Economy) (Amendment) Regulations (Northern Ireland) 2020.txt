“SCHEDULE 3
THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN
Part 1
Objectives
Overall objective
1.  To protect the environment and human health by preventing or reducing the generation of waste and the adverse impacts of the generation and management of waste and by reducing overall impacts of resource use and improving the efficiency of such use.
Application of the waste hierarchy
2.—(1) To apply the following waste hierarchy as a priority order in waste prevention and management policy—
(a)
prevention;
(b)
preparing for re-use;
(c)
recycling;
(d)
other recovery (for example energy recovery); and
(e)
disposal.
(2) To apply the waste hierarchy in sub-paragraph (1) in a manner which—
(a)
encourages the options that deliver the best overall environmental outcome, which may require specific waste streams departing from the hierarchy where this is justified by life-cycle thinking on the overall impacts of the generation and management of such waste; and
(b)
takes into account—
(i)
the general environmental protection principles of precaution and sustainability;
(ii)
technical feasibility and economic viability;
(iii)
protection of resources; and
(iv)
the overall environmental, human health, economic and social impacts.
(3) To make use of economic instruments and other measures to provide incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy, such as those listed in Part 4 of this Schedule or other appropriate instruments and measures.
Protection of human health and the environment
3.  To ensure that waste management is carried out without endangering human health, without harming the environment and, in particular—
(a)
without risk to water, air, soil, plants or animals;
(b)
without causing a nuisance through noise or odours; and
(c)
without adversely affecting the countryside or places of special interest.
Principles of self-sufficiency and proximity
4.—(1) To establish an integrated and adequate network of waste disposal installations and of installations for the recovery of mixed municipal waste collected from private households, including where such collection also covers such waste from other producers, taking into account best available techniques.
(2) The network must be designed so as to enable the European Union as a whole to become self-sufficient in waste disposal as well as in the recovery of mixed municipal waste collected from private households, and to enable the United Kingdom to move towards that aim individually, taking into account geographical circumstances or the need for specialised installations for certain types of waste.
(3) The network must enable waste to be disposed of, or mixed municipal waste collected from private households for recovery to be recovered, in one of the nearest appropriate installations and by means of the most appropriate methods and technologies, so as to ensure a high level of protection for the environment and human health.
(4) This paragraph does not require that the full range of final recovery facilities is located in Northern Ireland.
Part 2
Matters which must be included in the waste management plan
Analysis of the current waste management situation etc.
5.  The waste management plan must include an analysis of the current waste management situation, an analysis of the measures to be taken to improve environmentally sound preparation for re-use, recycling, recovery and disposal of waste and an evaluation of how the waste management plan will support the implementation of the objectives and provisions of the Waste Framework Directive.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations transpose the EU Circular Economy Package for Northern Ireland. The EU Circular Economy Package consists of four amending EU Directives in the field of waste, namely Directive (EU) 2018/849 (OJ No L 150, 14.6.2018, p. 93), Directive (EU) 2018/850 (OJ No L150, 14.6.2018, p. 100), Directive (EU) 2018/851 (OJ No L150, 14.6.2018, p. 109), Directive (EU) 2018/852 (OJ No L150, 14.6.2018, p. 141) (“the amending Directives”).
The amending Directives amend 6 EU Directives; European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (OJ No L365, 31.12.1994, p. 10), Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste (OJ No L182, 16.7.1999, p. 1) (“the Landfill Directive”), Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on end-of life vehicles (OJ No L269, 21.10.2000, p. 34), Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators (OJ No L266, 26.9.2006, p. 1), Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste (OJ No L312, 22.11.2008, p. 3) (“the Waste Framework Directive”) and Directive 2012/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (OJ No L197, 24.7.2012, p. 38) (“the relevant Directives”).
Part 2 of these Regulations amends primary legislation, the Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern Ireland) Order 1997, to update references to the Waste Framework Directive, and reflect definitions from Article 3 of the Waste Framework Directive. It also replaces Schedule 3 to that Order with a new Schedule, to update the requirements in terms of the content and objectives of waste management plans in order to take account of amendments made to the Waste Framework Directive.
Part 3 of these Regulations amends subordinate legislation. Regulation 4 amends the Waste Management Licensing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003, as amended, which deal with applications for waste management licences. Regulation 5 amends the Landfill Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003, as amended, which partially implement the Landfill Directive in Northern Ireland. Regulation 7 amends the Hazardous Waste Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005, as amended, which implement hazardous waste requirements in the Waste Framework Directive in Northern Ireland. Regulation 10 amends the Waste Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2011, as amended, which partially implement the Waste Framework Directive in Northern Ireland and regulation 14 contains transitional provision in relation to some of those amendments. Regulation 11 amends the Pollution Prevention and Control (Industrial Emissions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2013, as amended, to update requirements around waste incineration.
The remainder of the Regulations update references to the relevant Directives in the Landfill Allowances Scheme Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2004, the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007, the Environmental Liability (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009, the Marine Licensing (Exempted Activities) Order (Northern Ireland) 2011 and the Controlled Waste and Duty of Care Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2013.

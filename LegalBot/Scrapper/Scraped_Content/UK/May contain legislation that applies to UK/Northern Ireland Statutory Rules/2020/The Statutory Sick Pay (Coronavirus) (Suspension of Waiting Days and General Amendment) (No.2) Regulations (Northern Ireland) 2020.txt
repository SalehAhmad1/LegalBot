INSERTION OF SCHEDULE 2
Regulation 2(1)

1.  A person is, for the purposes of this Schedule, to be regarded as shielding himself where he is shielding himself in such a manner as to prevent infection or contamination with coronavirus pursuant to paragraph 2.
2.  The person is defined in public health guidance, because of an underlying health condition, as clinically extremely vulnerable and therefore at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus and has been advised, by shielding notification sent to, or in respect of, that person in accordance with that guidance, to follow shielding measures for the period specified in the notification.
3.  A person to whom paragraph 2 applies is no longer to be regarded as shielding himself—
(a)
immediately after the end of the period specified in the shielding notification;
(b)
from the date specified in a further shielding notification sent to, or in respect of, the person, advising him that he need no longer shield himself from that date.
4.  Nothing in paragraph 3 prevents the person from again being regarded as shielding himself if a further shielding notification is sent to, or in respect of, the person advising the person that he needs to shield himself for the period specified in the notification.
5.  In this Schedule—
“public health guidance” has the same meaning as in paragraph 6 of Schedule 1;
“shielding notification” means a notification in writing sent to, or in respect of, a person by —
(a)
the Chief Medical Officer; or
(b)
the Regional Agency for Public Health and Social Well-being.”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1982 (S.R. 1982 No. 283).
The amendments in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (8) and (10) and the Schedule ensure that persons who are shielding themselves from other people in such a manner as to prevent infection or contamination with coronavirus are to be deemed to be incapable of work for the purpose of entitlement to statutory sick pay.
The amendments in paragraphs (6), (7)(a)(ii) and (9)(a) ensure that persons deemed to be incapable of work because they or another person have the symptoms of coronavirus will remain entitled to statutory sick pay until the person with those symptoms receives notification that they have tested negative for coronavirus.
The amendments in paragraph (7)(a)(i) and (b) ensure that a person will be entitled to statutory sick pay if a member of their extended household has the symptoms of coronavirus.
The amendment in paragraph (9)(b) corrects a typographical error.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends the Statutory Sick Pay (Coronavirus) (Suspension of Waiting Days and General Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (S.R. 2020 No.54) to ensure that those deemed incapable of work by virtue of the amendments made by regulation 2 of these Regulations do not have to serve waiting days for entitlement for statutory sick pay.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations in view of the urgency required to provide additional financial support to those unable to work as a result of coronavirus.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 (SR. 2005 No. 506), the Social Fund Cold Weather Payments Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1988 (S.R. 1988 No. 368) and the Claims and Payments Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1987 (S.R. 1987 No. 465)
Regulation 2 substitutes “or” for “and” in regulation 9(3)(a)(ii) of the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 to clarify that claims may be made for both the fees levied for the provision and maintenance of the place where the burial takes place, and the fees levied by a private grave digger.
Regulation 3 substitutes the definition of “station” for the definition of “site” in the Social Fund Cold Weather Payments Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1988. It also substitutes “station” for “site” in all occurrences in those Regulations. This is so the regulations reflect the manner in which the Met Office are predicting temperatures.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 30(4B) of the Claims and Payments Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1987, so that where a State Pension or State Pension Credit claimant dies, any outstanding payments of those benefits can be made to relatives or other qualifying people. A written application has to be made by that person (except where they were the spouse or civil partner of the claimant). This amendment enables the outstanding payments to be made to any person who qualifies without them having to make a written application.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c.8), are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.

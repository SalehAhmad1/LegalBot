(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit (Coronavirus) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (S.R. 2020 No. 33) in response to the continuing outbreak of Coronavirus disease in Northern Ireland.
Regulation 2 of the Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit (Coronavirus) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 gives the Department discretion to disapply the seven waiting days that would otherwise apply to a person who has made a claim for an employment and support allowance. Regulation 3 of those Regulations gives the Department discretion to decide that a person who makes a claim for, or is entitled to, an employment and support allowance may be treated as a person having limited capability for work. Both provisions apply where a person is infected or contaminated with Coronavirus disease, is isolating to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease, or is caring for a child (or qualifying young person) who falls into either of those categories. Both provisions no longer have effect in relation to Universal Credit by virtue of the Social Security (Coronavirus) (Further Measures) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (S.R. 2020 No. 53).
Following a review by the Department of the operation of the Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit (Coronavirus) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020, regulation 2 amends the provision by which those regulations expire after eight months so that they now expire 14 months beginning with the date that S.R. 2020 No. 33 came into operation.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.

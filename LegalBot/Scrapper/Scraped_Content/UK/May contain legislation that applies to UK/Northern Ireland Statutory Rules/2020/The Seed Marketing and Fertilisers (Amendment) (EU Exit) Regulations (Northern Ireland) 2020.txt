Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations apply in Northern Ireland and implement the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol (the Protocol), in respect of seed marketing and fertilisers.
Part 2 amends the Seed Marketing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 to implement the Protocol in respect of seed of cereal, beet, vegetables and oil and fibre plants. It also provides for the marketing of fodder seed to continue under the UK regime. In addition, the amendments provide for fodder seed which has been certified in the EU to be marketed in Northern Ireland under OECD trade rules.
Schedule 3 of the 2016 Regulations is amended to reflect the difference in labelling requirements between fodder seed as part of the UK regime and the other species of seed which will continue to use EU labels.
Schedule 4 of the 2016 Regulations is amended to reflect the different requirements between fodder seed and the other species of seeds with regards to exceptions to the regulations such as early movement of seed, labelling of preservation varieties and seed not finally certified.
The Regulations also provide for references to Directive 66/401/EEC (fodder seed) in the 2016 Regulations to be read as if references to the EU in the Directive are references to the UK or NI, as the case may be.
Part 3 amends Northern Ireland legislation relating to the manufacture and marketing of fertilisers. Regulation 4 amends the Fertiliser Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1992 to ensure that fertilisers designated as “UK fertilisers” under retained EU law in Great Britain, can be marketed in Northern Ireland at the end of the Implementation Period.
Regulation 5 amends the EC Fertiliser Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 to reflect the fact that Northern Ireland is not part of the EU.
Regulation 6 revokes the Fertilisers (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.

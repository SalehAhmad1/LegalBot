Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of ozone depleting substances (“ODS”) (regulations 2 and 4) and fluorinated greenhouse gases (“F-gases”) (regulations 3 and 4).
As Northern Ireland still retains some responsibilities to the European Commission (“EC”) under the Northern Ireland Protocol, some requirements for businesses which use ODS and F-gases are reinstated through these Regulations.
These requirements concern businesses which report data on, or make records available about, their use of F-gases and ODS to the EC. Information must also be provided in an EC inspection.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no significant effects on any sector are foreseen.
Further information on these Regulations is available from the Chemicals and Industrial Pollution Policy Branch, Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Klondyke Building, 1 Cromac Avenue, Gasworks Business Park, Belfast, BT7 2JA.

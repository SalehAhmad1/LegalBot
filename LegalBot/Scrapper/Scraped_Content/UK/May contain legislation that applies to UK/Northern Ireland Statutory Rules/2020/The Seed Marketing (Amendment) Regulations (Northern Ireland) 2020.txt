(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/990 amending the list of genera and species in Article 2(1)(b) of Council Directive 2002/55/EC, in Annex II to Council Directive 2008/72/EC and in the Annex to Commission Directive 93/61/EEC (OJ No. L 160, 18.6.2019, p. 14), as amended by Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/432 amending Council Directive 2002/55/EC with regard to the definition of vegetables and the list of genera and species in Article 2(1)(b) (OJ No. L 88, 24.3.20, p. 3). They also implement Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2020/177 amending Council Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC, 2002/55/EC and 2002/57 as regards pests of plants on seeds (OJ No. l41, 13.2.2020, p.1).
These Regulations amend the Seed Marketing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 244), (“the 2016 Regulations)”, which implement various EU instruments, in particular Council Directive 66/401/EEC on the marketing of fodder plant seed (OJ No. L 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2298), Council Directive 66/402/EEC on the marketing of cereal seed (OJ No. L 125, 11.7.1966, p. 2309), Council Directive 2002/54/EC on the marketing of beet seed (OJ No. L 193, 20.7.2002, p. 12), Council Directive 2002/55/EC on the marketing of vegetable seed (OJ No. L 193, 20.7.2002, p. 33) and Council Directive 2002/57/EC on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants (OJ No. L 193, 20.7.2002, p. 74).
Regulation 2(2) provides for the Department to act as the member State, to temporarily permit the marketing of seed not satisfying the requirements in respect of the minimum germination laid down in the 2016 Regulations, for the purposes of Commission Regulation (EC) No 217/2006 (OJ No L38, 9.2.2006, p. 17).
Regulation 2(3) amends the list of vegetable plants and their associated common names in Schedule 1 to the 2016 Regulations (seed to which the Regulations apply) to make explicit where all varieties of a species are included and where only certain varieties of a species are included. It also provides for the application of the 2016 Regulations to hybrids of the species and Groups of vegetable plants listed
These Regulations amend provisions in the 2016 Regulations to require seed intended for marketing in Northern Ireland to be practically free from regulated non-quarantine pests at the place of production and for the presence of such pests on plant material not to exceed specified thresholds.

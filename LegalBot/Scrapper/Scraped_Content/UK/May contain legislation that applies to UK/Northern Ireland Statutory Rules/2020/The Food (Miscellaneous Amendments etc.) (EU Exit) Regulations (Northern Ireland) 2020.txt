These Regulations revoke the Food (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 as the changes due to be made by those are no longer necessary due to the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol. (regulation 2)
The Natural Mineral Water, Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015 are amended to update references to EEA States and the United Kingdom. (regulation 3)
The Food Hygiene Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 are amended to provide for the application of the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol with respect to health and identification marks. (regulation 4)
An impact assessment of the effect these Regulations has not been undertaken as it is believed there will be no or minimal costs to business, the voluntary sector and the public sector in Northern Ireland as a result of these regulations.

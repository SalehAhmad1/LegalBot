(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends section 144(1)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 7) to add Switzerland so that people in Switzerland who satisfy the qualifying conditions will receive the Christmas bonus following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. Regulation 2 also amends this section by replacing “member State” with “EEA state” since the Christmas bonus is paid pursuant to this section to people satisfying the qualifying conditions in all European Economic Area states.

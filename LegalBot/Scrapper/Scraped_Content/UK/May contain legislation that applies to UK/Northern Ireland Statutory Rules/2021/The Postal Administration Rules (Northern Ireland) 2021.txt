But the principal may specify one or more other such individuals to be proxy-holder in the alternative, in the order in which they are named in the proxy.
(4) Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph (3) of this Rule, a proxy for a particular meeting may be given to whoever is to be the chair of the meeting and for a meeting held as part of the proceedings in a winding up of the court or a bankruptcy it may be given to the official receiver.
(5) A person given a proxy under paragraph (4) of this Rule cannot decline to be the proxy-holder in relation to that proxy.
(6) A proxy requires the holder to give the principal’s vote on matters arising for determination at the meeting, or to abstain, or to propose, in the principal’s name, a resolution to be voted on by the meeting, either as directed or in accordance with the holder’s own discretion.Issue and use of forms
134.—(1) When notice is given of a meeting to be held in postal administration proceedings, and forms of proxy are sent out with the notice, no form so sent out shall have inserted in it the name or description of any person.

(3) A form of proxy shall be authenticated by the principal, or by some person authorised by the principal (either generally or with reference to a particular meeting). If the form is authenticated by a person other than the principal, the nature of the person’s authority shall be stated.Use of proxies at meetings
135.—(1) A proxy given for a particular meeting may be used at any adjournment of that meeting.
(2) Where the postal administrator holds proxies to be used by the postal administrator as chair of a meeting, and some other person acts as chair, the other person may use the postal administrator’s proxies as if that person were themselves proxy-holder.
(3) Where a proxy directs a proxy-holder to vote for or against a resolution for the appointment of a person other than the postal administrator as proposed liquidator of the company, the proxy-holder may, unless the proxy states otherwise, vote for or against (as the proxy-holder thinks fit) any resolution for the nomination or appointment of that person jointly with another or others.
(4) A proxy-holder may propose any resolution which, if proposed by another, would be a resolution in favour of which by virtue of the proxy they would be entitled to vote.
(5) Where a proxy gives specific directions as to voting, this does not, unless the proxy states otherwise, preclude the proxy-holder from voting at their discretion on resolutions put to the meeting which are not dealt with in the proxy.Retention of proxies
136.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this Rule, proxies used for voting at any meeting shall be retained by the chair of the meeting.

(4) Any person attending a meeting in postal administration proceedings is entitled, immediately before or in the course of the meeting, to inspect proxies and associated documents (including proofs) sent or given, in accordance with directions contained in any notice convening the meeting, to the chairman of that meeting or to any other person by a creditor, member or contributory for the purpose of that meeting.
(5) This Rule is subject to Rule 184 (confidentiality of documents—grounds for refusing inspection).Proxy-holder with financial interest
138.—(1) A proxy-holder shall not vote in favour of any resolution which would directly or indirectly place them, or any associate of theirs, in a position to receive any remuneration out of the insolvent estate, unless the proxy specifically directs them to vote in that way.
(2) Where a proxy-holder has authenticated the proxy as being authorised to do so by their principal and the proxy specifically directs the proxy-holder to vote in the way mentioned in paragraph (1) of this Rule, they shall nevertheless not vote in that way unless they produce to the chair of the meeting written authorisation from their principal sufficient to show that the proxy-holder was entitled so to authenticate the proxy.
(3) This Rule applies also to any person acting as chairman of a meeting and using proxies in that capacity under Rule 135; and in its application to them, the proxy-holder is deemed an associate of theirs.

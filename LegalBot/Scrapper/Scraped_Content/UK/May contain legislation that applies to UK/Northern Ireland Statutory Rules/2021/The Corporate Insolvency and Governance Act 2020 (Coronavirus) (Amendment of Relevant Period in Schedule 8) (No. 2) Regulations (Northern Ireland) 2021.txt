(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations extend the period during which Schedule 8 to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020(1) (“the Act “) is to have effect.
The Act established a new free standing moratorium to be available to companies in financial difficulties. Schedule 8 to the Act contains temporary provisions relating to moratoria which are intended to operate alongside the main permanent provisions during the coronavirus crisis, including a set of temporary rules which are intended to apply until such time as necessary amendments can be made to the Insolvency Rules (Northern Ireland) 1991(2) to enable the latter to apply with respect to moratoria.
The Act provided for the relevant period during which Schedule 8 was to apply to expire on 30 September 2020.
The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Amendment of Certain Relevant Periods) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020(3) prolonged the period during which Schedule 8 would apply by providing for this relevant period to instead expire on 30 March 2021.
The Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Amendment of Relevant Period in Schedule 8) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021(4) prolonged the period during which Schedule 8 would apply by providing for this relevant period to instead expire on 30 September 2021.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations further extends the period during which Schedule 8 will apply by providing for the relevant period to expire on 30 March 2022

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Order) 
This Order amends The One-Way Traffic (Londonderry) Order (Northern Ireland) 2008 (“the 
Order”) by introducing a one-way traffic system on a length of Police Court Street so that traffic 
can only proceed in a north-easterly direction from a point 46 metres north-east of its junction 
with Strand Road to its junction with Queens Quay. 
This Order also amends the Bye-Laws made in respect of Motor Hackney Carriages standing or 
plying for hire by the County Borough of Londonderry on 28th May 1963 and confirmed by the 
Ministry of Home Affairs on 28th June 1963 by reducing the length of the stand at Police Court 
Street.  The number of taxis permitted to use it is reduced from 6 to 4. 
Traffic signs indicating the effect of this Order will in due course be placed on the road.

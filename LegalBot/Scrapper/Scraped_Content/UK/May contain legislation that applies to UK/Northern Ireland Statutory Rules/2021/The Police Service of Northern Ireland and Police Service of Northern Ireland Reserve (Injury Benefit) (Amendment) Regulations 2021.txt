S.R. 2015 No.113.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
These Regulations make amendments to various instruments relating to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Police Service of Northern Ireland Reserve (Injury Benefits) Regulations 2006 and make provisions for payments to police officers who are permanently disabled as a result of an injury received without their own default in the execution of duty as a police officer or, where death results from such an injury, to surviving dependants of the deceased officer.
The amendments made by Regulation 2 to 18 make technical changes to ensure that the injury benefit schemes continues to work effectively for officers who join the police pension scheme established by the Police Pensions Regulations (Northern Ireland (“the 2015 regulations”). The amendment to paragraph 7(3)(d) of Schedule 3 to those regulations also ensures that an injury pension is not reduced in respect of a second or subsequent post retirement entitlements to employment and support allowance. New paragraph 7(3)(e) of Schedule 3 has the effect that there is no reduction in respect of employment and support allowance in circumstances where there has been a previous reduction of an individual’s injury pension on the basis of entitlement to incapacity benefit and post retirement the individual has a subsequent new entitlement to employment and support allowance.
Regulation 19 makes consequential amendments to “the 2015 Regulations” and endures that deferred members of the scheme established under “the 2015 Regulations” who also accrued benefits under an earlier scheme cannot suffer any detriment when their entitlement to benefits is calculated.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument as no impact on the costs of business or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

Chief Medical OfficerEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 to remove the requirement to be seated in a hospitality venue to consume food or drink, remove the legal requirement to maintain social distancing in a hospitality venue, permit dancing in all venues and permit the reopening of nightclubs. It also removes the requirement for a ticket to be purchased in advance for an outdoor event.
A minor amendment is made to regulation 15A to correct the numbering.
No regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

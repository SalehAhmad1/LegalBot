The Department for Infrastructure in accordance with Article 14(1) of the Roads (Northern 
Ireland) Order 1993 considers it expedient for the purpose of improving the trunk system that the 
road proposed to be constructed on the route described in Part I of the Schedule should be 
designated as trunk road. 
The Department in accordance with Article 68(4) of that Order proposes, on completion of works 
providing alternative facilities for road traffic, to stop-up the roads described in part II of the 
schedule to road traffic. 
The Department makes the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 14(1) 
and 68(1), (3) and (5) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993(a) and now vested in it (b). 
Notice of the proposed Order has been published, served and displayed in accordance with 
paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 8 to the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993. 
2 objections were received by the Department prior to the closing date of the statutory consultation 
period. The Department having considered the objections that were made and not withdrawn, 
decided to proceed without subjecting the scheme to an examination through a public inquiry.

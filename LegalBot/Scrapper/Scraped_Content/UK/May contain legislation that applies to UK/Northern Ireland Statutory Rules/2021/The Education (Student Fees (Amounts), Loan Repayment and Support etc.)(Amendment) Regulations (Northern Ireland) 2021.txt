A senior officer of the Department for the EconomyEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulations 2 to 4 of these regulations amend the Student Fees (Amounts) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 (“the 2005 Regulations”) by increasing the basic and higher amounts prescribed in the 2005 Regulations. In each case the increases are by 2.3%, and will come into operation on 1st September 2022.
The 2005 Regulations prescribe the basic and higher amounts which higher education institutions in Northern Ireland may charge by way of tuition fees. Regulation 3 of the 2005 Regulations sets out the basic and higher amounts which ordinarily apply. Regulation 4 of the 2005 Regulations sets out the lower basic and higher amounts which apply in respect of an academic year of specified courses.
Regulations 6-9 amend the Education (Student Support) (No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 (S.R. 2009 No.373) (“the 2009 Regulations”).
Regulations 6 and 7 correct errors of omission which should have been included in the Education (Student Support, etc.) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021. Similarly Regulation 9 does the same for the Education (Student Fees and Support) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021. These amendments update references to listed events to include new paragraphs added.
Regulation 8 amends the provision relating to categories of students entitled to loans for living costs and long courses loans for the quarters ending on 30th June 2021 and 31st August 2021. The amendment provides that full-time students attending designated courses who were paid the London or outside London rates of loan in the quarter ending on 31st March 2021 will not be treated as falling into category A, and paid the parental home rate, unless they request to be paid at that rate.
Regulation 11 and 12 amend the Education (Student Loans) (Repayment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 (S.R. 2009 No. 128) (“the Repayment Regulations”).
Regulation 11 inserts the definition for the term ‘approved method’ used in Part 4.
Regulation 12 amends regulation 71 of the 2009 Regulations so that the Department has a measure of discretion in determining the applicable threshold for borrowers who reside overseas but only in cases where the Department is unable to calculate the price level index for the borrower’s country of residence.

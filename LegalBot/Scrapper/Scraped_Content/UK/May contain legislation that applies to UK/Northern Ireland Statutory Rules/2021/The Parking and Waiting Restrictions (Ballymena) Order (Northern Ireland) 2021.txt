The Department for Infrastructure(a) makes the following Order in exercise of the powers 
conferred by Articles 4(1), (2) and (3), 10(4), 13(1), (13) and (16) and 27A of the Road Traffic 
Regulation (Northern Ireland) Order 1997(b) and now vested in it(c). 
It appears to the Department to be necessary to provide suitable parking places for vehicles on the 
lengths of the roads specified in Schedule 1 to this Order. 
The Department has consulted such persons as it considered appropriate in compliance with 
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedules 1, 4 and 4A to the Road Traffic Regulation (Northern Ireland) 
Order 1997. 
The Department has published a notice in compliance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of those Schedules. 
The Department, in compliance with paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 4 to that Order, has taken such 
other steps as appear to the Department reasonably practicable for the purpose of bringing 
specifically to the knowledge of the occupiers of land adjacent to the parking places the particulars 
specified in paragraph 3(2) of that Schedule. 
Eight written objections have been received and subsequently withdrawn and no other 
representation has been received.

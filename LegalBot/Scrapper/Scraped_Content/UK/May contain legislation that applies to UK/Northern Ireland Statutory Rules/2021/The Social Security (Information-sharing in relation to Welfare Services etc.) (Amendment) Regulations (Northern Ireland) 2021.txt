These Regulations amend the Social Security (Information-sharing in relation to Welfare Services etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 56). They are being issued free of charge as they rectify errors in those Regulations.
Regulation 2(2) and (3) make amendments to the heading to Part 3 and regulation 6(1) (holding purposes) so that the purposes for which information must be held by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive or other ‘qualifying person’, in order for those persons to use or supply it, encompass those relating to both ‘welfare services’ and housing benefit. See Articles 121(7) and (8) of the Welfare Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/2006) for the definitions of ‘qualifying person’ and ‘welfare services’.

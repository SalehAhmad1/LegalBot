the seal has been broken to facilitate the amendment of specified days; or
(c)
a new taximeter has been fitted and has not yet been inspected, tested and sealed in accordance with the Taximeter Regulations..
The Regulations also provide for the fee for inspection, testing and sealing of a taximeter to be waived where the application for the taximeter test is made and received during the period 24th November 2021 to 28th February 2022.

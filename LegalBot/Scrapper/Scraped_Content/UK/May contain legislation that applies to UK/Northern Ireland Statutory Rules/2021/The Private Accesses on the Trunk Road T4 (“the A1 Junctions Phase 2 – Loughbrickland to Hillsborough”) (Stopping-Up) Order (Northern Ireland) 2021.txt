The Department for Infrastructure(a) makes the following Order in exercise of the powers 
conferred by Article 69(1) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993(b) and now vested in it(c). 
The Department considers that the use of 36 private means of access from the roads specified in 
column (2) of Schedule 1 to the lands described in relation thereto in column (3) of that Schedule 
and 4 private means of access from the roads specified in column (2) of Schedule 2 to the lands 
described in relation thereto in column (3) of that Schedule are likely to cause danger to, or 
interfere unreasonably with, traffic on those roads. 
The Department, in accordance with Article 69(2)(b) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993, 
is satisfied that other reasonably convenient means of access to the lands specified in Schedule 1 
will be provided. 
The Department, in accordance with Article 69(2)(a) of that Order, is satisfied that access from the 
roads to the lands specified in Schedule 2 is not reasonably required. 
Notice has been published and served in compliance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 5 to 
that Order. 
Seven written objections were received. Two objections were withdrawn and five objections were 
duly considered.  
The Department, having caused a local inquiry to be held into the objections that were made and 
not withdrawn and having considered the report of the inquiry, now proposes to make the Order.

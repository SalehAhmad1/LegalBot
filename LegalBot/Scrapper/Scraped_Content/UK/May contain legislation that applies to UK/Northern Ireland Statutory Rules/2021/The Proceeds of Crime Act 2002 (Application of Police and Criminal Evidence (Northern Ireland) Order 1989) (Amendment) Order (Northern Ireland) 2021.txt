(This note is not part of the Order)
The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Application of Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989) Order (Northern Ireland) 2016 (“the 2016 Order”) applies, with modifications, certain provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (S.I. 1989 No. 1341 (N.I. 12)) (“the 1989 Order”) to search and seizure warrants obtained in Northern Ireland under section 352 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (c. 29) for the purposes of a confiscation investigation, a money laundering investigation or a detained cash investigation, and to the powers of seizure under those warrants.
This Order amends the 2016 Order so that the relevant provisions of the 1989 Order apply to search and seizure warrants obtained in two new categories of investigation introduced by the Criminal Finances Act 2017 (c. 22), namely a detained property investigation and a frozen funds investigation (”the new investigations”). The new investigations relate to two new forfeiture powers (“the new powers”); the forfeiture of certain listed items of personal (or moveable) property and the forfeiture of money held in an account maintained with a bank or building society.
This Order also introduces a new modification to the application of Article 23(8) of the 1989 Order, in the context of the new investigations as well as in the context of detained cash investigations. Article 23(8) of the 1989 Order provides that the duty to grant access to, or supply a photograph or copy of, anything seized under a warrant does not arise where the officer in charge of the investigation has reasonable grounds to believe that to grant access or supply a photograph or copy would prejudice a criminal investigation or proceedings. Article 2(4)(c) of this Order extends this to civil proceedings under Chapter 2, 3, 3A or 3B of POCA (that is, in relation to the existing civil recovery and cash forfeiture powers under POCA, and in relation to the new powers).
Article 2(5)(c) of this Order makes a further modification to the application of Article 24(2)(a) of the 1989 Order, to provide that material seized under a warrant in the context of the new investigations may be retained for use as evidence in proceedings in relation to the new powers, and the existing cash forfeiture and civil recovery powers.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this Order as no impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sectors.

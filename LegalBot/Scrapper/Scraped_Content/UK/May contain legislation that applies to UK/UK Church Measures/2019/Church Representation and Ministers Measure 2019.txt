Church electoral roll
Compilation of the roll
1
(1)
In every parish there must be a church electoral roll (referred to in these Rules as “the roll”) on which the names of lay persons are entered in accordance with this Part of these Rules.

A lay person is entitled to have his or her name on the roll of a parish if he or she—
(a)
is baptised,
(b)
is aged 16 or over (but see paragraph (7)),
(c)
has made one of the following three declarations, and
(d)
has duly applied for enrolment on Form 1.
(3)
The first declaration is a declaration that the person—

(b)
is resident in the parish.
(4)
The second declaration is a declaration that the person—
(a)
is a member of the Church of England or of a Church in communion with it,
(b)
is not resident in the parish, but
(c)
has habitually attended public worship in the parish during the preceding six months.
(5)
The third declaration is a declaration that the person—
(a)
is a member in good standing of a Church which is not in communion with the Church of England but subscribes to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity,
(b)
is also a member of the Church of England, and
(c)
has habitually attended public worship in the parish during the preceding six months.
(6)
A person who is entitled under this Rule to have his or her name on the roll of more than one parish is entitled to have his or her name on the roll of each of those parishes; but the following provisions specify purposes for which the person is required to choose one of those parishes—
(a)
Rule 16(2) (membership of the house of laity of a deanery synod);
(b)
Rule 33(6) (additional members of diocesan synod nominated by bishop);
(c)
Rule 36(4) (eligibility for election to diocesan synod);

(e)

(7)
Where a lay person, who is going to become 16 after a revision of the roll or the preparation of a new roll is complete but before the date of the annual parochial church meeting, duly applies for enrolment on Form 1, the enrolment may take effect on the person's 16th birthday.
(8)
The roll of a parish must be kept and revised—
(a)
by the PCC, or
(b)
by the electoral roll officer under the direction of the PCC.
(9)
Where a new parish is created by a pastoral scheme by the union of two or more former parishes, the roll of the new parish is in the first instance to consist of the rolls of the former parishes combined to form a single roll.
(10)
In any other case where a new parish is created by a pastoral scheme, the roll of the new parish is in the first instance to consist of the name of every person who—
(a)
on the date when the new parish comes into existence, has his or her name on the roll of a parish the whole or part of which forms part of the new parish, and
(b)
is resident in the new parish or has habitually attended public worship there.
(11)
The roll of a parish must, where practicable, specify the address of every person whose name is on it; but a failure to specify an address does not affect the validity of the entry.
(12)
Where a person has provided an email address on Form 1, the roll must specify that email address.
(13)
A copy of the roll of a parish must be made available for inspection, on a reasonable request being made to the PCC; and the copy made available for inspection must include every name entered on the roll but no other personal data.

that, if the person wishes to have his or her name entered on the new roll, the person must apply for enrolment.
(2)
The duty under paragraph (1) does not apply in the case of a person whose name would be removed under Rule 4 if the roll were being revised; but before deciding that a person comes within the fourth, fifth or sixth case under that Rule, the PCC must take reasonable steps to establish the relevant facts.
(3)

(4)
A person whose name is already on the roll is not disqualified from having his or her name on the new roll merely because he or she has not complied with the condition in Rule 1(4)(c) or (5)(c) (habitual attendance at public worship), if the person was prevented from doing so by illness or other sufficient cause.

for complying with Rule 1(2)(b) and (7) (persons becoming 16).

(4)
The term of office of a person co-opted under this Rule is (subject to termination or resignation) for the lifetime of the deanery synod; but that does not prevent the person from being co-opted on one or more subsequent occasions.
Election of parochial representatives
19
(1)
The parochial representatives of the laity on a deanery synod—
(a)
are elected every three years beginning with 2020 by the annual parochial church meeting of each parish in the deanery, and

hold office for a term of three years beginning with the next 1 July following the date of their election.
(2)
The number of representatives to be elected from each parish is determined by a resolution of the diocesan synod no later than 31 December in the year preceding the elections.
(3)
A diocesan synod may calculate the number of representatives from a parish for the purposes of paragraph (2)—
(a)
by reference to the number of names on the roll of the parish specified in the notification under Rule 10,
(b)
by reference to the number of parish churches or districts in the parish, or

a list of the names and addresses of the members of the house of clergy of that synod, specifying for each member the category of membership under Rule 15(1), and
(b)
a list of the names and addresses of the members of the house of laity of that synod, specifying for each member the category of membership under Rule 16(1).

(3)
The secretary of each deanery synod must give the diocesan electoral registration officer details of any subsequent changes to the membership of the house of clergy or the house of laity of that synod.
Number of members
21
(1)
A diocesan synod must exercise its powers under this Part of these Rules so as to secure that the total number of members of each deanery synod in the diocese is—
(a)
no more than 150 (subject to paragraph (2)), and
(b)
so far as practicable, no less than 50.
(2)
The figure of 150 given in paragraph (1)(a) may be exceeded in order—
(a)
to secure that the house of laity has at least as many members as the house of clergy has, or
(b)
to enable the operation of a scheme under Rule 23 or 24 which was made since the most recent resolution passed under Rule 19(2).
(3)
For the avoidance of doubt, the figure of 150 given in paragraph (1)(a) includes the maximum number of persons who may be co-opted as members of either house.
Scheme for variation of membership
22
(1)
A diocesan synod may make a scheme to vary the preceding provisions of this Part of these Rules that relate to the membership of deanery synods so as both—
(a)
to meet the special circumstances of the diocese or the deaneries, and
(b)
to secure better representation of clergy or laity or both on the deanery synods.
(2)
Where a scheme under this Rule has effect, the preceding provisions of this Part of these Rules, in so far as they apply to each deanery synod concerned, have effect subject to the scheme.

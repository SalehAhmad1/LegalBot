Diocesan Boards of Education Measure 2021
2021 No. 1
A Measure passed by the General Synod of the Church of England to make provision about Diocesan Boards of Education.
[29th April 2021]1
Continuation
For each diocese, there is to continue to be a Diocesan Board of Education (referred to in this Measure as the “DBE” for a diocese).2
General functions
(1)
The DBE for each diocese must—
(a)
promote or assist in the promotion of education in the diocese that is consistent with the faith and practice of the Church of England;
(b)
promote or assist in the promotion of religious education and religious worship in schools in the diocese;
(c)
promote or assist in the promotion of church schools in the diocese;
(d)
promote co-operation between itself and other persons concerned with education in the diocese.
(2)
The DBE for each diocese also has the functions conferred by sections 7 to 15.
(3)
In this Measure, “function” means power or duty.3
Single DBE
(1)
Each diocesan synod must make a scheme designating one of the following as the DBE for the diocese—
(a)
a company limited by guarantee, or a charitable incorporated organisation (“CIO”), which is registered in the register of charities,
(b)
an unincorporated body which is registered in the register of charities, or
(c)
the Diocesan Board of Finance (referred to in this Measure as “the Board of Finance” for the diocese).
(2)
The first scheme under this section must implement a proposal made by the bishop of the diocese with the consent of the existing DBE.
(3)
A subsequent scheme under this section must implement a proposal which—
(a)
if the existing DBE comes within subsection (1)(a) or (b), is made by the bishop of the diocese with the consent of the existing DBE;
(b)
if the existing DBE comes within subsection (1)(c), is made by the bishop of the diocese after consultation with the existing DBE and with the consent of the Board of Finance.
(4)
If the archbishop of the province in which the diocese is situated considers that consent under subsection (3) is being unreasonably withheld or delayed, the archbishop may authorise the bishop to make the proposal to the diocesan synod without having obtained that consent; and subsection (3) is accordingly to be read subject to this subsection.
(5)
Before giving an authorisation under subsection (4), the archbishop must consult the Charity Commission on the proposed terms of the scheme; and if the Charity Commission does not respond within the period of 90 days beginning with the day on which the proposed terms are sent to the Charity Commission for that purpose, the Charity Commission is to be regarded as having no comments on the proposed terms.
(6)
Where the first scheme under this section provides that the existing DBE for a diocese is to be designated as the DBE for the diocese, the existing DBE must, pending the coming into operation of the scheme, take such steps as it considers necessary for securing compliance with the requirements of this Measure.
(7)
On the coming into operation of a scheme under this section which designates the Board of Finance as the DBE for the diocese, a committee of the Board of Finance is established under this section; and the purpose of that committee is to exercise the DBE's functions on behalf of the Board of Finance.
(8)
Accordingly, in the application of this Measure to a case where the Board of Finance is so designated, a reference to the DBE for the diocese is to be read as a reference to the committee established under this section.
(9)
Schedule 1 makes further provision about a scheme under this section.
(10)
The provisions in Schedule 2 apply in relation to the DBE for each diocese.

A diocesan synod may make a scheme with one or more other diocesan synods designating either of the following as joint DBE for both or all of the dioceses concerned—
(a)
a company limited by guarantee, or a CIO, which is registered in the register of charities, or
(b)
an unincorporated body which is registered in the register of charities.
(2)
A scheme under this section may not, accordingly, designate the Board of Finance as a joint DBE.

(4)
A scheme under this section must implement a proposal made by the diocesan bishops concerned acting jointly—
(a)
except in so far as paragraph (b) applies, with the consent of each of the DBEs concerned (including in the case of a scheme under subsection (3), the consent of the joint DBE), and
(b)
if any of the DBEs concerned comes within section 3(1)(c), after consultation with that DBE and with the consent of the Board of Finance of the diocese concerned.
(5)
If the archbishop of the province in which one or more of the dioceses concerned is situated considers that consent under subsection (4) is being unreasonably withheld or delayed, the archbishop may authorise the bishop or bishops concerned to join in making the proposal to the diocesan synod without having obtained that consent; and subsection (4) is accordingly to be read subject to this subsection.
(6)
Before giving an authorisation under subsection (5), the archbishop must consult the Charity Commission on the proposed terms of the scheme; and if the Charity Commission does not respond within the period of 90 days beginning with the day on which the proposed terms are sent to the Charity Commission for that purpose, the Charity Commission is to be regarded as having no comments on the proposed terms.
(7)
Where a scheme is made under this section, each of the diocesan synods which made the scheme is to be regarded as having complied with section 3(1).
(8)
Schedule 1 (except paragraph 3) applies to a scheme under this section as it applies to a scheme under section 3; and a reference in this Measure to a scheme under section 3 includes a reference to a scheme under this section.

(2)
Where the Board of Finance is designated as the DBE for the diocese under section 3, the committee established under that section may, if it has obtained the consent of the bishop of the diocese, the diocesan synod and the Board of Finance, take such steps as it considers necessary for there to be a scheme under section 3 designating as the DBE for the diocese a company limited by guarantee, or a CIO, which is registered in the register of charities.
(3)
The power under subsection (1) may be exercised before the first scheme is made under section 3 or subsequently.
(4)
Any conflict of interest or loyalty which would or might arise on the incorporation of a DBE as a result of one or more of the charity trustees of the charity in its unincorporated form being charity trustees of the charity in its incorporated form is authorised by virtue of this subsection; but this subsection applies only where the value of the assets being transferred on the incorporation exceeds the amount of any liabilities being transferred.

The power to make an order under this section is exercisable by statutory instrument; and the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 applies—

Repeal of the 1991 Measure
(1)
The Diocesan Boards of Education Measure 1991 (“the 1991 Measure”) is repealed, except for—
(a)
section 11(1)(a) (which amends section 5(5) of the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1956), and
(b)
section 13 (short title, commencement and extent), so far as necessary for the purposes of section 11(1)(a).
(2)
Accordingly, each order of the Secretary of State under section 1 of the Diocesan Boards of Education Measure 1991 which was in force immediately before the commencement of this section is revoked.
(3)
In consequence of the repeal made by subsection (1), the following provisions (which amend the Diocesan Boards of Education Measure 1991) are repealed—
(a)
in the Education Act 1996, in Schedule 37, paragraph 104 and the preceding cross-heading;
(b)
in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, in Schedule 30, paragraphs 29 to 32 and the preceding cross-heading;

(4)
This section is subject to section 23(8) (which makes transitional and saving provision in relation to the commencement of this section).22
Preparatory steps
(1)
Before the commencement of a provision of this Measure, the DBE, the Board of Finance and the diocesan synod for a diocese may each take such steps as it considers necessary or appropriate, and the bishop of a diocese may take such steps as he or she considers necessary or appropriate, for facilitating the implementation of that provision.
(2)
If, before the passing of this Measure, the DBE, the Board of Finance or the diocesan synod for a diocese has taken steps which it, or the bishop of a diocese has taken steps which he or she, considers necessary or appropriate for facilitating the implementation of a provision of this Measure, those steps are to be treated as if they had been taken in reliance on subsection (1) after the passing of this Measure.
(3)
Subsections (1) and (2) do not affect the operation of section 13 of the Interpretation Act 1978 (anticipatory exercise of powers) in relation to this Measure.23
Steps for making first scheme
(1)
If the Archbishops' Council is satisfied that a diocesan synod is ready to make the first scheme under section 3 in relation to that diocese in time for the scheme to come into operation by 1 January 2023, the Archbishops' Council must certify to the diocesan synod that—
(a)
the scheme will come into operation on the date specified in or determined in accordance with the certificate, and
(b)
section 3(10) and Schedule 2 will come into force in relation to that diocese on that date.
(2)
If, on 1 November 2022, the Archbishops' Council is not satisfied as mentioned in subsection (1) in relation to a diocese, it must refer the matter to the archbishop of the province in which the diocese is situated.
(3)
The archbishop, on receiving a referral under subsection (2), must make a scheme for the diocese in such terms as the archbishop considers appropriate in all the circumstances.
(4)
Before making a scheme under subsection (3), the archbishop must consult the Charity Commission on the proposed terms of the scheme; and if the Charity Commission does not respond within the period of 90 days beginning with the day on which the proposed terms are sent to the Charity Commission for that purpose, the Charity Commission is to be regarded as having no comments on the proposed terms.
(5)
A scheme made under subsection (3) is to be treated for the purposes of this Measure as the first scheme made under section 3 in relation to the diocese concerned.
(6)
The DBE for a diocese continues, pending the coming into operation of the first scheme under section 3 in relation to the diocese, to be constituted as it was immediately before the commencement of this section.
(7)
Accordingly, the period of office of each person who, at the end of 2021, is serving as a member of the DBE for a diocese continues pending the coming into operation of the first scheme under section 3 in relation to the diocese, even if, in the case of an elected member of the DBE, that person ceases to be a member of the diocesan synod after the end of 2021.
(8)
Sections 1 and 10 of, and the Schedule to, the Diocesan Boards of Education Measure 1991, and any order of the Secretary of State under section 1 of that Measure in force immediately before the coming into operation of the first scheme under section 3 in relation to a diocese, continue in force so far as necessary for the purposes of subsections (6) and (7) of this section, in spite of the repeals made by section 21.24
Short title, commencement and extent
(1)
This Measure may be cited as the Diocesan Boards of Education Measure 2021.
(2)
This section and section 22 come into force on the day on which this Measure is passed.
(3)
The remaining provisions of this Measure, apart from section 3(10) and Schedule 2, come into force two months after the day on which this Measure is passed.
(4)
Section 3(10) and Schedule 2 come into force in relation to each diocese on the day certified in relation to that diocese under section 23(1).
(5)
The Archbishops' Council may by order make transitional, transitory or saving provision in connection with the commencement of a provision of this Measure.
(6)
The power to make an order under this section is exercisable by statutory instrument; and the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 applies as if the order had been made by a Minister of the Crown and as if this Measure were an Act of Parliament.
(7)
This Measure extends to—
(a)
the whole of the province of Canterbury, except the Channel Islands (subject to subsection (8)), and
(b)
the whole of the province of York, except the Isle of Man (subject to subsection (9)).
(8)
This Measure may be applied to the Channel Islands or either of them, with or without modifications, under any procedure for doing so which has effect in the Islands or (as the case may be) the Island in question; and for this purpose, the references to the Channel Islands or either of them have the same meaning as references to the Bailiwicks or either of them have in the Channel Islands Measure 2020.
(9)
If an Act of Tynwald or an instrument made under an Act of Tynwald so provides, this Measure extends to the Isle of Man subject to such exceptions, adaptations or modifications as are specified in the Act or instrument.1

which is held on the uniform statutory trusts set out in Schedule 36 to the Education Act 1996.

(9)
Where provision made in the scheme for the purposes of sub-paragraph (6) has the effect of altering the company's constitution, section 34 of the Companies Act 2006 (notice to registrar of companies where constitution altered by enactment) applies to the alteration as if it were an alteration made by an enactment; and, for that purpose, a reference in that section to an enactment is to be treated as a reference to the provision in the scheme.2

(a)
that the DBE committee or the sub-committee is failing to act in accordance with this Measure or the scheme in relation to that function, and
(b)
that the failure is significant.
(5)
The scheme must include provision as to the procedure of the DBE committee and of any sub-committee; and the scheme may for that purpose authorise the Board of Finance to make such provision.

(a)
the functions conferred on the Board by virtue of paragraph 3, and

The consent of the DBE for the purposes of section 3(2) or (3) may be signified by a certificate signed by the bishop of the diocese and by the director of education of the diocese.

An amendment to a scheme under section 3 has effect only if—
(a)
the DBE has consented to it, and
(b)
it is approved by the diocesan synod.
(3)
A scheme under section 3 may be supplemented by a further scheme under that section (which may itself be amended or revoked).
(4)
In the application of this paragraph to a scheme under section 4, sub-paragraph (2)(b) has effect as if the reference to the diocesan synod were a reference to each of the diocesan synods concerned.10
(1)
Where a scheme under section 3 is revoked, the body which the scheme had designated as the DBE ceases to be the DBE; and the diocesan synod must secure that a scheme of a kind coming within sub-paragraph (3) will come into operation immediately after the revocation.
(2)
Where a scheme under section 4 is revoked, the body which the scheme had designated as the joint DBE ceases to be the joint DBE; and each of the diocesan synods concerned must secure that a scheme of the kind coming within sub-paragraph (3) will come into operation immediately after the revocation.
(3)
A scheme comes within this sub-paragraph if it is—
(a)
a scheme under section 3 designating a body as the DBE for the diocese;
(b)
a scheme under section 4 made with one or more other diocesan synods designating a body as the joint DBE for the diocese and the other diocese or dioceses concerned;
(c)
a scheme under section 4 made with one or more other diocesan synods designating an existing joint DBE as the DBE for the diocese too.
(4)
In the case of a scheme under section 4, a diocesan synod may give reasonable notice in writing to the other diocesan synod or synods concerned that it no longer wishes the joint DBE to be the DBE for that diocese.
(5)
Where a diocesan synod has given (and not withdrawn) notice under sub-paragraph (4) on the expiry of which there would be only one diocese for which the joint DBE was designated as the DBE, the scheme under section 4 is revoked on the expiry of the notice and sub-paragraph (2) applies accordingly.
(6)
Where a diocesan synod has given (and not withdrawn) notice under sub-paragraph (4) on the expiry of which there would still be at least two dioceses for which the joint DBE was designated as the DBE—
(a)
the joint DBE ceases on the expiry of the notice to be the joint DBE for the diocese whose diocesan synod gave the notice,
(b)
that diocesan synod must secure that a scheme of a kind coming within sub-paragraph (3) will come into operation immediately after the expiry of the notice, and
(c)
the other diocesan synods must make a scheme to amend or supplement the scheme under section 4 so far as they consider necessary or appropriate to enable the joint DBE to continue to operate.

The revocation of a scheme under section 3 or 4 has effect only if the scheme under section 3 or 4 which is to come into operation immediately after the revocation is approved by the diocesan synod.

(1)
Where a scheme under section 3 provides for the transfer of property, the legal title to that property is by virtue of the scheme itself to be transferred in accordance with the scheme, without the need for any further document.
(2)
The transfer of property by a scheme under section 3 does not operate as a breach of a covenant or condition against alienation or give rise to a forfeiture.13
In this Schedule, a reference to a transfer of property which would trigger a right of reverter is a reference to a transfer of property which would give rise to a trust under section 1 of the Reverter of Sites Act 1987.Prospective

If it appears to the Board that there has not been an increase in the general level of prices in Great Britain during the reference period concerned, the percentage figure for the purposes of subsection (1)(a) is 0%.

An increase in the rate of pension takes effect on whatever date the Board determines; but—
(a)
the interval between increases must not exceed 12 months, and

if the interval is less than 12 months, the increase must not exceed the percentage which bears the same proportion to 5% as the reference period used under subsection (1)(a) bears to 12 months.

The Board may, in the case of a particular member of the past service scheme, augment that member's pension under the scheme by such amount and for such period as it agrees with the Church Commissioners.

If the Board considers, in the case of a particular member of the past service scheme, that its estimate of that member's total income for a particular year is, or is likely to be, less than the amount which the Board has determined for that year with the agreement of the Church Commissioners, it may pay the member a supplementary pension.
(8)
The determination of the amount of a supplementary pension must be made in accordance with the general directions of the Church Commissioners; but the amount must not exceed whatever is required to bring the member's total income for the year in question up to the amount determined for that year under subsection (7).
(9)

Sch. 2 para. 1 in force at 1.3.2019 by S.I. 2019/98, art. 22
(1)
This paragraph applies where the member's qualifying period of pensionable service to which the past service scheme applies is at least 37 years of whole-time service.
(2)
If the member has not at any time in that period held the office of archbishop, diocesan bishop, suffragan bishop, dean, provost or archdeacon, the rate of pension is the full basic pension.
(3)
If the member has at any time in that period held an office referred to in sub-paragraph (2), the rate of pension is calculated by multiplying the full basic pension by the multiple in the following Table that is applicable to that office—
Office Multiple
Archbishop 2
Bishop of London 1.8
Diocesan bishop (other than the Bishop of London) 1.5
Suffragan bishop, dean, provost or archdeacon 1.25
(4)
If the member has held more than one of those offices, the multiple to be used in the calculation under sub-paragraph (3) is the higher or highest applicable to the offices which he or she has held.
(5)
The amount of the lump sum payment, where the member becomes entitled to it after the commencement of this Schedule, is three times the full basic pension.
(6)
“Full basic pension” means two-thirds of the national minimum stipend for the year preceding that in which payment of the pension begins.
(7)
The “national minimum stipend” for a year is the amount which the Archbishops' Council specifies in its annual report as the amount which it recommends as the national minimum for that year for the stipends of clergy of incumbent status.

(1)
This paragraph applies where the member's qualifying period of pensionable service to which the past service scheme applies is less than 37 years of whole-time service.
(2)
The rate of the pension for that period of service is calculated as follows.
(3)
The first step is to divide by 37 the rate of pension to which the member would be entitled if the qualifying period of pensionable service were 37 years of whole-time service.
(4)
The second step is to multiply the number obtained under sub-paragraph (3) by the number of complete years in the period of whole-time service.
(5)
The third step, which must be taken if the period of whole-time service includes part of a year, is—
(a)
to divide by 12 the number obtained under sub-paragraph (3),
(b)
to multiply the number obtained under paragraph (a) by the number of complete months in that part of the year, and
(c)
to add the number obtained under paragraph (b) to the number obtained under sub-paragraph (4).
(6)
The amount of the lump sum payment is that which bears the same proportion to three times the full basic pension as the pension to which the member is entitled on retirement for the whole-time service bears to that to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired on reaching the retiring age with a qualifying period of service of 37 years of whole-time service.

(1)
This paragraph applies where the member's qualifying period of pensionable service to which the past service scheme applies consists of or includes part-time service performed after 1 January 1987.
(2)
In a case where the pension for that part-time service became payable before the commencement of this Schedule, the rate of pension continues to be the rate which the Board had determined under paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the Church of England Pensions Regulations 1998.
(3)
In a case where the pension for that part-time service becomes payable after the commencement of this Schedule, the rate of pension is calculated by multiplying the rate which would have been payable if the service had been whole-time service by such proportion as the Board determines.
(4)
When making a determination under sub-paragraph (3), the Board must act in accordance with the general directions of the Church Commissioners.
(5)
The amount of the lump sum payment is the amount which bears the same proportion to three times the full basic pension as the pension to which the member is entitled on retirement for the part-time service bears to that to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired on reaching the retiring age with a qualifying period of service of 37 years of whole-time service.
(6)
The qualifying period of pensionable service in a case where the pension for the part-time service becomes payable after the commencement of this Schedule does not include a year, or part of a year, in which the amount received by the member in respect of stipendiary ecclesiastical service is less than such amount as the Board determines with the agreement of the Church Commissioners.

(a)
had continued until reaching the retiring age to perform pensionable service of the kind he or she was performing immediately before retiring, and
(b)
had retired on reaching the retiring age.
(3)
Otherwise, the rate of pension is the rate, and (if the member retires after the commencement of this Schedule) the amount of the lump sum payment is the amount, to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had retired on reaching the retiring age.

who, after ceasing to do so but before reaching the retiring age, satisfies the Board that he or she has, or satisfied it that he or she had, become incapable through infirmity of performing pensionable service.
(2)
The rate of pension is the rate, and (if the member ceases to perform pensionable service after the commencement of this Schedule) the amount of the lump sum payment is the amount, to which the member would have been entitled if he or she had reached the retiring age on the day on which he or she ceased to perform pensionable service.

(a)
working out the rate of pension to which the member would have been entitled under Part 1 of this Schedule if he or she had reached the retiring age on the date on which the pension becomes payable, and
(b)
deducting from that such amount as the Board determines with the agreement of the Church Commissioners.
(3)
If the member is entitled to a lump sum payment, the amount is calculated by—
(a)
working out the amount of the lump sum payment to which the member would have been entitled under Part 1 of this Schedule if he or she had reached the retiring age on the date on which he or she retired, and
(b)

It is up to the member to choose the amount of an additional lump sum payment under this paragraph; but the amount must not exceed that which, when aggregated with the amount of the member's lump sum payment under section 15, is the maximum amount permitted as a pension commencement lump sum.
(3)
Accordingly, a member may not exercise the power under this paragraph if the amount of the member's lump sum payment under section 15 is equal to the maximum amount permitted as a pension commencement lump sum.

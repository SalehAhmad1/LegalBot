This Measure may be cited as the Statute Law (Repeals) Measure 2018.

The power to make an order under subsection (3) or (4) is exercisable by statutory instrument; and the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 applies to an order under that subsection as if it had been made by a Minister of the Crown and as if this Measure were an Act of Parliament.

(7)
This Measure may be applied to the Channel Islands, or either of them, in accordance with the Channel Islands (Church Legislation) Measures 1931 and 1957; and a reference in this section to the Channel Islands or either of them has the same meaning as a reference in those Measures to the Islands or either of them.

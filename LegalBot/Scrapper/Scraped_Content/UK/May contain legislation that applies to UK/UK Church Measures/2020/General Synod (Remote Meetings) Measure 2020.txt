Consultation on and publication of special standing orders
(1)
Before making standing orders under section 1, the officers of the General Synod acting jointly must consult—
(a)
the Business Committee of the General Synod appointed in accordance with section 10 of the National Institutions Measure 1998, and
(b)
the Standing Orders Committee of the General Synod appointed under the Standing Orders of the Synod.
(2)
Consultation undertaken before the commencement of this Measure is as effective for the purposes of subsection (1) as consultation undertaken after that commencement.
(3)
After making standing orders under section 1, the officers of the General Synod acting jointly must ensure that—
(a)
the standing orders are published on the Church of England website at least 10 days before the first day of the first meeting of the General Synod due to be held (in whatever manner) after the standing orders come into operation under section 3(1), and
(b)
a copy of the standing orders is sent to each member of the Synod.
(4)
If standing orders proposed to be made under section 1 have been published before the commencement of this Measure, and standing orders in the form published are made after that commencement, the publication before that commencement—
(a)
is to be treated as if it had been done in accordance with subsection (3)(a), and
(b)
is, accordingly, as effective as a publication done after that commencement.3
Operation of special standing orders
(1)
Standing orders made under section 1 come into operation on the day after that on which they are published under section 2(3)(a) and continue in operation pending the decision by the General Synod on the question of whether to approve the standing orders.
(2)
The question of whether to approve the standing orders is to be the first item of business at the first meeting of the General Synod held (in whatever manner) after the standing orders come into operation.
(3)
The provisions of the Standing Orders of the General Synod relating to the consideration of an instrument made under a Measure or Canon apply to the standing orders as they apply to such an instrument; and for that purpose the requirement in section 2(3)(a) applies instead of the deadline for providing members of the Synod with a copy of the instrument concerned before it is due to be considered by Synod.
(4)
If the standing orders are approved by the General Synod (with or without amendment), they continue in operation until the end of the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which they are so approved.
(5)
But the General Synod may resolve that the standing orders—
(a)
are not to cease to be in operation at the time when they would otherwise cease to be so under subsection (4) or under the most recent resolution made under this subsection or subsection (6), and
[F1(b)
are instead to continue in operation (with or without amendment) either for such period as the General Synod may specify in the resolution or for an indefinite period.]
(6)
If standing orders under section 1 have ceased to be in operation (whether under this section or section 4), the General Synod may resolve that they are to be revived (with or without amendment) and to be in operation [F2either for such period as the General Synod may specify in the resolution or for an indefinite period]; and they are to be treated as being in operation so far as necessary for the purpose of enabling the Synod to consider whether to pass a resolution under this subsection.
(7)
Standing orders under section 1 have effect in spite of any provision in the Constitution or in the Standing Orders of the General Synod with which they are inconsistent [F3; and “the Constitution” means the Constitution of the General Synod set out in Schedule 2 to the Synodical Government Measure 1969].

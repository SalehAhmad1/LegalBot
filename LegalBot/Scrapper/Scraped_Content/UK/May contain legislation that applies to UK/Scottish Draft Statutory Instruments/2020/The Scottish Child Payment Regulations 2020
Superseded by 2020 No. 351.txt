(b)
would be eligible for the Scottish child payment applied for if the application were treated as made on a day falling within the period of 14 days beginning with the day they received it,

vary any period for which the individual’s Scottish child payment is to be given by way of deduction that may have been specified in a previous determination of the individual’s entitlement, or
(c)
cease making deductions, and instead give the individual’s Scottish child payment in the form of money.
(4) The Scottish Ministers are to make a determination (without receiving an application) where an individual who is receiving a Scottish child payment by way of deduction under a previous determination of entitlement notifies the Scottish Ministers that the individual—

the individual’s right to appeal under paragraph 23.

(a)
the day that the request for a re-determination is received by the Scottish Ministers, or

(3) If the Scottish Ministers fail to make the determination within that period—
(a)
their duty to make the determination ends (but they may still make it), and

inform the individual—

that the individual therefore has the right to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal against the determination under paragraph 3 which prompted the request for a re-determination, and

PART 5
Further provision about determining entitlement
Obtaining information to make determination
25.—(1) Where the Scottish Ministers are determining an individual’s entitlement to a Scottish child payment, and require further information in order to satisfy themselves about any matter material to the making of the determination, they may request that the individual provide them with the information within such period as they specify.
(2) If the individual fails to provide information requested under sub-paragraph (1) within the specified period the Scottish Ministers may, without further consideration, proceed to make the determination on the basis that the individual does not satisfy the eligibility rules in regulation 18, or (as the case may be) that the individual has no continuing entitlement under regulation 19.
Duty to notify change of circumstances
26.—(1) The Scottish Ministers may place a duty to notify them about a change in circumstances on a person to whom sub-paragraph (3) or (4) applies.
(2) The Scottish Ministers place a duty under sub-paragraph (1) on a person by informing the person—

of the changes in circumstances which the person has a duty to notify them about,

Lifting of duty to notify change of circumstances
27.—(1) A duty to notify the Scottish Ministers about a change of circumstances placed on a person under regulation 27 or paragraph 26 ceases to apply when—
(a)
it is lifted under sub-paragraph (2), or
(b)
it stops being the case that a change in any of the circumstances to which the duty relates can affect someone’s entitlement to be given a Scottish child payment.
(2) The Scottish Ministers may lift a duty placed on a person under regulation 27 or paragraph 26 by informing the person that the duty is lifted.
(3) Under sub-paragraph (2), the Scottish Ministers may lift a duty as it relates to some or all of the changes in circumstances which the person has a duty to notify them about.
Right to support

(2) The Scottish Ministers’ duty under sub-paragraph (1) includes ensuring that any person acting on their behalf complies with such a wish, unless the wish is unreasonable.

PART 6
Recovery of value of assistance
Liability for assistance given in error
29.—(1) An individual is liable to pay the Scottish Ministers the value of any assistance that was given to the individual due to an error (but see paragraph 30).
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, the individual’s liability under sub-paragraph (1) is limited to the difference in value between—
(a)
the assistance that was given, and
(b)
the assistance (if any) that would have been given had the error not been made.
(3) If the assistance was given in a form other than money, its value for the purposes of this paragraph is what giving it cost the Scottish Ministers (excluding any administration costs).
(4) In this paragraph and paragraph 30, references to an error are to—
(a)
an error in the performance of a function conferred by virtue of these Regulations, including a decision under regulation 13 being made—
(i)
wrongly, or
(ii)
correctly but on the basis of—
(aa)
incorrect information, or
(bb)
an assumption which proves to be wrong.
(b)
a new decision under regulation 13 not being made after an assumption on the basis of which an earlier decision was made has proved to be wrong.
Exclusion from liability
30.—(1) An individual has no liability under paragraph 29(1) in respect of assistance given due to an error if the error is neither—
(a)
the individual’s fault, nor
(b)
the kind of error that an individual could reasonably be expected to notice.
(2) For the purpose of this paragraph, an error is an individual’s fault if it is caused or contributed to by the individual—
(a)
providing false or misleading information,
(b)
failing to notify the Scottish Ministers about a change in circumstances in breach of a duty to do so under regulation 27 or paragraph 26, or
(c)
causing another person to do either of those things.
(3) In considering whether an error is of a kind that an individual could reasonably be expected to notice, the following are amongst the matters to which regard is to be had—
(a)
the extent to which the value of the assistance given in error exceeds the value of the assistance that would have been given (if any) had the error not been made,
(b)
whether any information given to the individual by the Scottish Ministers prior to, or immediately after, the assistance being given would have alerted a reasonable person to the fact that a decision had been, or was to be, made on the basis of incorrect information or a wrong assumption.
(4) In—
(a)
sub-paragraph (2)(a), the reference to providing information includes making a statement,
(b)
sub-paragraph (3)(b), the reference to information given to the individual by the Scottish Ministers does not include information explaining why the Ministers consider the assistance to have been given in error.
Consideration for debtor’s circumstances
31.—(1) This paragraph applies to decisions of the Scottish Ministers about—
(a)
whether to seek to recover money owed under paragraph 29, and
(b)
the method by which money owed under that paragraph is to be recovered.
(2) In making a decision to which this paragraph applies, the Scottish Ministers must have regard to the financial circumstances of the individual who owes the money (so far as those circumstances are known to the Ministers).
Exclusion of other rights of recovery
32.—(1) An individual given assistance in error has no non-statutory obligation based on redress or unjustified enrichment to pay the value of that assistance to the Scottish Ministers.
(2) In sub-paragraph (1)—
(a)
“non-statutory obligation” means an obligation that arises from a rule of law rather than an enactment,
(b)
the reference to assistance being given in error is to be construed in accordance with paragraph 29(4).
Liability where assistance given for period after death
33.—(1) An individual’s estate is liable to pay the Scottish Ministers the value of any assistance that was given to the individual under regulation 17 in respect of a period after the individual’s death.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, assistance may be regarded as having been given to an individual for the purposes of this paragraph despite being given after the individual’s death.
PART 7
Coronavirus – relaxation of deadlines
Re-determination and appeal deadlines
34.—(1) A request for a re-determination is valid, despite being made after the expiry of the period described in sub-paragraph (3) of paragraph 14, if the person deciding whether the individual has a good reason for not requesting a re-determination sooner decides that the individual has a good reason that is related to coronavirus.
(2) An appeal may be brought under paragraph 19, despite the appeal application being made after the expiry of the period described in sub-paragraph (1)(c) of paragraph 21, if the First-tier Tribunal gives permission for the appeal to be brought under sub-paragraph (1)(b) of that paragraph on the basis of being satisfied that the good reason for the application not being made sooner is related to coronavirus.
(3) Any provision of Scottish Tribunal Rules that would (but for this sub-paragraph) have the effect of precluding an appeal being brought by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) is to be disregarded to the extent that it would have that effect.
(4) In this paragraph, “coronavirus” has the meaning given by section 1 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020.
Timing of applications for Scottish child payment
35.—(1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies where these Regulations make an individual’s eligibility for a Scottish child payment depend (in any way) on an application being made by a particular time.
(2) The person determining an individual’s entitlement to the assistance may treat the individual’s application as having been made by that time if satisfied that the reason for its not being made sooner is related to coronavirus.
(3) For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of these Regulations that make a child’s age at the time an application is made material to the determination of an individual’s entitlement to a Scottish child payment are to be understood to make the individual’s eligibility depend on the application being made by a particular time (namely the time at which the child ceases to be the specified age or fall within the specified age bracket).
(4) In this paragraph, “coronavirus” has the meaning given by section 1 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020.

2014 asp 10.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision about a Scottish child payment, a type of assistance to be given by the Scottish Ministers under section 79 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”). The payment will be provided as an additional payment to top-up the forms of reserved assistance specified in regulation 14, to persons who meet the eligibility criteria in regulation 18.
Part 2 of the Regulations provides for interpretation.
Part 3 of the Regulations sets out who is eligible to be given a Scottish child payment and provides for when continuing eligibility is to cease. It also states the value of the assistance that is to be given. Assistance can only be given in monetary form or given (in whole or in part) by way of deduction from an outstanding liability to the Scottish Ministers under these Regulations or section 63 of the 2018 Act.
Part 4 of the Regulations makes transitory provision for the treatment of applications during a 14 week period beginning with the day on which the Regulations come into force with entitlement to assistance being determined at the end of that period.
The schedule to the Regulations deals with procedural matters connected with applications for a Scottish child payment, decisions on applications and appeals. Part 2 of the schedule provides for circumstances in which a determination must, or can, be made without an application for assistance having been made.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in consequence of the Management of Offenders (Scotland) Act 2019 (“the 2019 Act”).
The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (“the 1974 Act”) formerly referred to “rehabilitated persons”. That Act is amended by the 2019 Act to instead refer to “protected persons”.
Part II of schedule 1 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) currently refers to persons who are rehabilitated persons for the purposes of the 1974 Act. These Regulations amend Part II of schedule 1 of the 1980 Act to the effect that it will instead refer to persons who are protected persons for the purpose of the 1974 Act. This is to maintain consistency with the terminology of the 1974 Act following that Act’s amendment by the 2019 Act.

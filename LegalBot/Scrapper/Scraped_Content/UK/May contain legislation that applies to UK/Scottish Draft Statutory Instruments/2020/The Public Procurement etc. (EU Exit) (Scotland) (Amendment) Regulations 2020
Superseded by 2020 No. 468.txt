PART 3
PROVISIONS COMMENCED ON IP COMPLETION DAY
Procurement involving contracting authorities or utilities from other member States
6.—(1) This paragraph applies in relation to the omission, by these Regulations, of—
(a)
regulation 40 of the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 (procurement involving contracting authorities from different member States),
(b)
regulation 55 of the Utilities Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (procurement involving utilities from different member States).
(2) Those omissions do not imply—
(a)
any prohibition of the activities authorised by the omitted regulations (which activities might, accordingly, be carried on to any extent that would have been lawful if the omitted regulations had never existed), or
(b)
that any matters provided for in those regulations are necessarily to have a different effect unless so required by applicable law (including rules for resolving any conflicts between the laws of different jurisdictions).
Saving of implied power to terminate contracts
7.—(1) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
a contract was awarded before IP completion day, and
(b)
immediately before IP completion day, the contract contained a power—
(i)
implied by regulation 73(3) of the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 to terminate the contract on the ground mentioned in regulation 73(1)(c) of those Regulations,
(ii)
implied by regulation 47(3) of the Concession Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2016 to terminate the contract on the ground mentioned in regulation 47(1)(c) of those Regulations, or

implied by regulation 87(3) of the Utilities Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2016 to terminate the contract on the ground mentioned in regulation 87(1)(c) of those Regulations.
(2) On and after IP completion day, that power continues despite the omission, by these Regulations, of regulations 73(1)(c), 47(1)(c) or 87(1)(c), as the case may be.
Saving of regulation 55(5) of the Concession Contracts Regulations 2016
8.  The amendment made by these Regulations to regulation 55(5) of the Concession Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (application of the first ground of ineffectiveness) does not apply where the contract referred to in regulation 55(5) was awarded before IP completion day.

(a)
regulation 91(7) of the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015,

PART 4
PROVISIONS COMMENCED 12 MONTHS AFTER IP COMPLETION DAY
Saving in relation to procurements commenced before regulations 5, 7 and 9 come into force
10.  The amendments made by regulations 5, 7 and 9 do not affect any procurement commenced before the date on which those amendments come into force (“the second commencement date”).
11.  For the purposes of this Part, a procurement has been commenced before the second commencement date if, before that date—
(a)
a notice has been submitted to the UK e-notification service in accordance with applicable Procurement Regulations in order to—
(i)
invite offers or requests to be selected to tender for or to negotiate in respect of a proposed contract, framework agreement or dynamic purchasing system, or
(ii)
publicise an intention to hold a design contest,
(b)
the contracting authority or utility has had published any form of advertisement seeking offers or expressions of interest in a proposed contract, framework agreement or dynamic purchasing system, or
(c)
the contracting authority or utility has contacted any economic operator in order to—
(i)
seek expressions of interest or offers in respect of a proposed contract, framework agreement or dynamic purchasing system, or
(ii)
respond to an unsolicited expression of interest or offer received from that economic operator in relation to a proposed contract, framework agreement or dynamic purchasing system.
12.  For the purposes of this Part, a procurement covers the whole of the procedures which stem from that commencement.
13.  Accordingly, for example, if a contract notice in relation to a proposed framework agreement under the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 has, before the second commencement date, been submitted as described in paragraph 11(a), paragraph 10 applies to the award of any contracts based on that framework agreement regardless of whether the relevant specific procedure for the award of any such contract under regulation 34(6) to (10) of the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 had itself been commenced before the second commencement date.
14.  Procedures taken for the purpose of modifying a contract or framework agreement are not to be regarded, for the purposes of paragraph 12, as stemming from the commencement of the procurement from which the award of that contract or framework agreement had itself stemmed.
15.  A procedure commenced as described in paragraph 11(a)(i), (b) or (c) is not to be regarded, for the purposes of paragraph 12, as stemming from the commencement of any design contest that had previously been held in relation to the subject-matter of the procurement.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace the Public Procurement etc. (Scotland) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.S.I. 2019/112 – “the first exit S.S.I.”), the Public Procurement etc. (Scotland) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Amendment Regulations 2019 (S.S.I. 2019/114 – “the second exit S.S.I.”) and the Public Procurement etc. (Scotland) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 2019 (S.S.I. 2019/414 –“the third exit S.S.I.”). The second exit S.S.I. and the third exit S.S.I. amend the first exit S.S.I. As a result, the revoked Regulations will not come into force.
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68) and paragraph 1(1) and (3) of Part 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. Many of the provisions in these Regulations are unchanged from the first S.S.I. (as amended by the second exit S.S.I. and the third exit S.S.I.), but additional deficiencies are addressed and some of the original provisions are changed.
These Regulations make amendments in the field of public procurement. Part 2 amends the Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 (asp 12). Part 3 amends secondary legislation. In particular, Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Part 3 amend the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015 (S.S.I. 2015/446), the Utilities Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (S.S.I. 2016/49), the Concession Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (S.S.I. 2016/65), the Procurement (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (S.S.I. 2016/145), the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (S.S.I. 2012/88) and the Utilities Contract (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (S.S.I. 2012/89) respectively. Part 4 amends retained direct EU legislation. The schedule makes transitional and savings provisions.
These Regulations are also made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 11G(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in order to implement Title 8 (ongoing public procurement and similar procedures) of Part 3 of the withdrawal agreement and the corresponding Title 5 of Part 3 of the EEA EFTA separation agreement. For the meaning of “withdrawal agreement”, “EEA EFTA separation agreement” and “IP completion day” see section 39(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020. In particular, the schedule to these Regulations differs markedly from the schedule to the first exit SI in providing for procedures that are ongoing on IP completion day to continue without being subject to any substantive changes in the procurement rules applicable to them. The schedule also contains various other savings that are unconnected with those agreements.
The power contained in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 has been relied upon for amendments made by regulation 4(8)(a)(i) and (22)(a).
No business or regulatory impact assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

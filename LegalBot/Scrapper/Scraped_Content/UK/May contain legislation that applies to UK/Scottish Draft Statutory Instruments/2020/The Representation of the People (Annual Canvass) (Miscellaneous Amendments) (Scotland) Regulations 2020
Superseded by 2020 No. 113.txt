DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Representation of the People (Annual Canvass) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1451 (“the 2019 Regulations”) amended the Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001 (“the 2001 Regulations”) to reform the annual canvass in respect of a parliamentary register of electors. These Regulations make provision for the reformed annual canvass to apply to a register of local government electors in Scotland.
Regulations 3 to 14 of these Regulations amend the 2001 Regulations. Regulations 7 to 14 amend regulations 32ZBA to 32ZBG, which were inserted by the 2019 Regulations, so that they apply to the annual canvass for the local government register in Scotland. In extending the regulations 32ZBA to 32ZBG to all registers, specific provision is made in regulations 32ZBD to 32ZBG to reflect that 16 and 17 year olds are entitled to vote in local government and Scottish Parliament elections and attainers (14 and 15 year olds) are also entitled to be registered.
Regulations 5 and 6 revoke regulations 32ZA and 32ZB of the 2001 Regulations which make provision for the annual canvass. Regulations 15 and 16 make a consequential change to Scottish Elections (Reduction of Voting Age) Act 2015 following the revocation of the reform of the annual canvass.
The Scottish Government has prepared and is publishing on its website a Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment and an Equality Impact Assessment.

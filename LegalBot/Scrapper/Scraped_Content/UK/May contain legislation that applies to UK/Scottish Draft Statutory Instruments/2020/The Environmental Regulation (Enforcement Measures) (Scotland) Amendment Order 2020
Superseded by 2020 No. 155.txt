DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order confers additional powers on the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (“SEPA”) to enable it to enforce the requirements of the Deposit and Return Scheme for Scotland Regulations 2020 (“the Regulations”).
It amends the Environmental Regulation (Enforcement Measures) (Scotland) Order 2015 (“the 2015 Order”) so that, where offences are committed under the Regulations, SEPA may also exercise its powers under the 2015 Order to impose a fixed or variable monetary penalty, or to accept an enforcement undertaking.

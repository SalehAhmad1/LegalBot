consent to the application,
(b)
consent subject to reasonable conditions, or

withhold consent, provided that it is not unreasonably withheld.
(4) The owner must, within one month of receipt of an application, send the disabled person a notice of the owner’s decision, in the form prescribed in Part 2 of the schedule.
(5) Where the owner fails to comply with the requirement in paragraph (4) the owner is to be taken to have withheld consent.
(6) If a share in the common parts affected by the proposed works is owned by 2 or more persons, the decision as to whether to consent to the proposed works (and whether to impose conditions on any consent so granted) can be made by either (or any) of those persons, but if they disagree as to the decision, they shall be taken to have withheld consent unless—

the health, safety, welfare and convenience of those occupying any part of the premises and other persons using the common parts,
(b)
the costs which the owner is likely to incur, directly or indirectly, as a result of the proposed works,

whether the proposed works are likely—

to reduce the value of their property, the common parts or of any other part of the premises, or
(ii)
to make their property, the common parts or any other part of such premises less suitable for letting or sale,
(d)
whether, if the proposed works were to be carried out, the common parts could be re-instated,

(ii)
provide a plan for the maintenance of the adjustments once made.
(3) Subject to paragraph (4), it is reasonable for an owner of the common parts affected by the proposed works to withhold consent to an application, or to impose conditions on such consent, if making the relevant adjustments or, as the case may be, failure to comply with that condition would make the owner liable under any enactment or rule of law to any sanction or other remedy.
(4) Paragraph (3) applies only where the owner has taken all reasonable steps for the purposes of acquiring the right to give consent or, as the case may be, not to impose the condition without making the owner so susceptible.

(2) The costs of the relevant adjustments include the costs of maintenance and reinstatement.Appeals

a condition imposed on consent given to the proposed works under regulation 5(3)(b).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make supplementary provision by amending the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016 (“the Act”).
Section 112(3) of the Act defines the “amnesty period” referred to in Chapter 8 of the Act. During the amnesty period, a tenant of an agricultural holding who intends to claim compensation at the end of the tenancy (at “waygo”) for certain improvements which have been carried out may give notice of this, under Chapter 8 of the Act, to the landlord in certain circumstances. A tenant may then be able to claim compensation for such improvements notwithstanding historical anomalies.
Regulation 2 amends section 112(3) of the Act in order to extend the amnesty period by 6 months. The amnesty period began on 13 June 2017 and was due to expire on 12 June 2020. The amnesty period will now expire on 12 December 2020.

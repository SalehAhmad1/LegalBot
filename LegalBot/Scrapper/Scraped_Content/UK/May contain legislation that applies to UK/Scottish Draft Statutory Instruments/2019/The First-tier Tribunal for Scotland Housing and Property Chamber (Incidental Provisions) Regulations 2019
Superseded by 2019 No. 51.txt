the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 to refer to case management discussions as well as hearings,
the Removing from Heritable Property (Form of Charge) (Scotland) Regulations 2011 so that those Regulations apply to enforcement in relation to the Tribunal as well as in relation to the sheriff court, and
the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007 so that the provisions apply to enforcement in relation to the Tribunal as well as in relation to the sheriff court.

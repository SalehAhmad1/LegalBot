PART D
Other measures
18.  Where an area is demarcated under paragraph 5 by the Scottish Ministers, they must ensure that regular official checks are carried out on susceptible plants which are being moved out of the demarcated area, or from the infected zone to the buffer zone in the demarcated area.
19.  The Scottish Ministers must ensure that the checks referred to in paragraph 18 are carried out at—
(a)
the points where the susceptible plants are moved from the infected zone into the buffer zone;
(b)
the points where the susceptible plants are moved from the buffer zone into an area outside the demarcated area;
(c)
their place of destination in the buffer zone; and
(d)
their place of destination outside the demarcated zone.
20.  The checks must include an examination of the UK plant passport accompanying the plants and an examination to ascertain the identity of the material in the consignment.

that the plant pest has been found in a site with physical protection from the vectors of the plant pest;
(b)
there is evidence that the susceptible plants were infected with the plant pest before they were introduced into that area; and
(c)
no vectors carrying the plant pest have been detected in tests carried out in accordance with internationally validated testing methods in the vicinity of those plants.
24.  Where the Scottish Ministers do not demarcate an area for the reasons specified in paragraph 23(a) to (c), they must ensure that annual surveys are carried out for a period of at least two years beginning on the date of its decision not to demarcate the area, in order to determine whether any other plants are or have been infected with the plant pest.

the plant pest is not detected in the demarcated area over a period of five years in official surveys carried pursuant to paragraph 1(h) of Schedule 8A or by the monitoring referred to in paragraph 16(g); and
(b)
where the buffer zone has been reduced in accordance with paragraph 7, one year after the date of its initial establishment if the following conditions are met—
(i)
the measures described in paragraphs 7(a) to (d) have been taken and, as a result, the Scottish Ministers are able to conclude with a high degree of confidence that the initial presence of the plant pest was an isolated case and no further spread has occurred in the demarcated area; and
(ii)
as close as practically possible to the time of lifting, official tests have been carried out in the demarcated area in accordance with international standards, which targeted symptomatic plants and asymptomatic plants in the proximity of the symptomatic plants.
26.  Where the demarcation of an area is lifted under paragraph 25(b), the Scottish Ministers must ensure that the susceptible plants located in that area are subject to intensive surveys for a period of two years following the date of the lifting of the demarcation.
27.  Those surveys must—
(a)
be carried out in accordance with international standards;

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are principally made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 and by paragraph 21 of schedule 7 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) (“the 2018 Act”) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular, the deficiencies mentioned in section 8(2)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Part 2 (regulations 2 to 17) is made in exercise of powers under the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68), and makes provision:
to amend the Plant Health (Scotland) Order 2005 (“the 2005 Order”), in order to expressly transpose certain obligations of the member State contained in Council Directive 93/85/EEC on the control of potato ring rot (OJ L 259, 18.10.1993, p.1), Council Directive 98/57/EC on the control of Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith) Yabuuchi et al (OJ L. 235, 21.8.1998, p.1) and Council Directive 2007/33/EC on the control of potato cyst nematodes and repealing Directive 69/465/EEC (OJ L 156, 16.6.2007, p.12) to ensure that those provisions become “retained EU law” at exit day, for the purposes of the 2018 Act;
to amend the 2005 Order to implement Commission Implementing Decision 2002/757/EC on provisional emergency phytosanitary measures to prevent the introduction into and the spread within the Community of Phytophthora ramorum Werres, De Cock & Man in ‘t Veld sp. nov. (OJ L 252 20.9.2002, p.37) and to revoke S.S.I. 2004/488, which currently implements that Implementing Decision;

Part 3 (regulations 19 to 71) makes amendments to the 2005 Order, consequential on the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
Part 4 (regulations 72 to 75) amends, with savings, the Plant Health (Import Inspection Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (S.S.I. 2014/338), the Plant Health (Export Certification) (Scotland) Order 2018 (S.S.I. 2018/132) and the Plant Health Fees (Scotland) Regulations 2008, consequential on the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union and in consequence of the amendments made by Parts 2 and 6.
Part 5 (regulation 76) revokes the Potatoes Originating in Egypt (Scotland) Regulations 2004, which implements Commission Implementing Decision 2011/787/EU (OJ L 319, 2.12.2011, p.112), consequential on the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union and in consequence of the amendments made by Part 2.

4.  Any survey which is carried out for the purposes of paragraph 7(c) or 16(g) must be based on a grid split of 100 m x 100 m squares within a zone of a width of at least 1 km surrounding the infected zone and a grid split of 1 km x 1 km squares within the rest of the buffer zone.
PART B
Establishment of a demarcated area
5.  The Scottish Ministers must by notice and without delay demarcate an area in relation to the infection consisting of an infected zone and a buffer zone around the infected zone.
6.  The infected zone must include all plants known to be infected by the plant pest, all plants showing symptoms indicating possible infection by the plant pest and all other plants liable to be infected by the plant pest due to their close proximity to infected plants or a known common source of production with infected plants or plants grown from them.
7.  The boundary of the buffer zone must be at least five km beyond the boundary of the infected zone, but may be reduced to one km beyond the boundary of the infected zone where the Scottish Ministers conclude with a high degree of confidence that the initial presence of the plant pest has not resulted in any spread of the plant pest and the following conditions have been met—
(a)
all host plants within a radius of 100 m of the infected plant have been promptly removed;
(b)
no other plants have been found infected by the plant pest in the infected zone following official tests which have been carried out at least once during the course of the year and which targeted symptomatic plants, as well as asymptomatic plants in the proximity of the symptomatic ones;
(c)
a delimiting survey has been carried out in the zone surrounding the infected zone that extended at least 2.5 km beyond the boundary of the infected zone, which included visual inspections of susceptible plants and the sampling and testing of symptomatic plants, as well as asymptomatic plants in the proximity of the symptomatic plants; and
(d)
the possibility of natural spread of the plant pest has been excluded as a result of tests which have been carried out twice during the flight season of the relevant vector and in accordance with international guidelines in which no vectors carrying the plant pest have been detected in the infected zone.
8.  The demarcation of the infected zone and the buffer zone must be based on sound scientific principles, the biology of the plant pest and its vectors, the level of infection, the distribution of the susceptible plants in the area concerned and the presence of vectors of the plant pest.
9.  Where the infection is limited to one particular sub-species of the plant pest which has been identified by one positive molecular test carried out in line with international standards, the demarcation may be based on that sub-species alone.
10.  If there is a confirmed finding of the plant pest in the buffer zone, the Scottish Ministers must either demarcate a further area or amend the original demarcated area in accordance with paragraphs 5 to 9 to take account of that finding.
11.  The Scottish Ministers must maintain a list of demarcated areas in their territory and publish that list.
12.  Paragraph 5 is subject to paragraph 23.

in the case of any plants to which paragraph 17 applies—
(i)
the official inspection of those plants during the flight season of relevant vectors for symptoms of the plant pest and measures to ensure their physical isolation; and
(ii)
their sampling and testing for the presence of the plant pest where symptoms of the plant pest are present;
(c)
the sampling and testing of susceptible plants within a radius of 100 m of each infected plant in accordance with ISPM No. 31;
(d)
the application of appropriate phytosanitary treatments against vectors of the plant pest and plants that may host those vectors prior to the removal of any plants under sub-paragraph (a);
(e)
the destruction of the plants removed under sub-paragraph (a) either in situ or in a nearby location designated for this purpose within the infected zone in a manner that ensures that the plant pest is not spread;
(f)
appropriate investigations to identify the origin of the infection, which must include the tracing of susceptible plants associated with the infected plants (including those that were moved before the demarcated area was established);
(g)
annual surveys to monitor the presence of the plant pest, which must include visual inspections of susceptible plants and the sampling and testing of symptomatic plants, as well as asymptomatic plants in the proximity of the symptomatic ones;

(a)
the host plants have been sampled and tested and have been confirmed not to be infected by the plant pest;
(b)
the individual host plants have, or the area concerned has, been physically isolated in an appropriate manner from relevant vectors for the purpose of preventing the spread of the plant pest;
(c)
appropriate agricultural practices for the management of the plant pest and its vectors have been applied.
PART D
Other measures
18.  Where an area is demarcated under paragraph 5 by the Scottish Ministers, they must ensure that regular official checks are carried out on susceptible plants which are being moved out of the demarcated area, or from the infected zone to the buffer zone in the demarcated area.
19.  The Scottish Ministers must ensure that the checks referred to in paragraph 18 are carried out at—

the provenance of the lots in the consignment;
(b)
the degree of susceptibility of the plants; and
(c)
the extent to which each operator in the demarcated area has complied with the restrictions on the movement of susceptible plants under this Order and with any other official measure imposed on the operator to eradicate or contain the plant pest.
22.  Where any checks carried out pursuant to paragraph 18 show that the plants do not comply with the requirements specified under this Order in relation to their movement, the Scottish Ministers must ensure that those plants are destroyed immediately in situ or in a nearby location and that all necessary precautions to avoid the spread of the plant pest and its vectors are taken during and after removal.
PART E
Measures to be taken where no demarcated area is established
23.  The Scottish Ministers need not demarcate an area in relation to a finding of the plant pest in Scotland where—
(a)
there is evidence—

(ii)
that the plant pest has been found in a site with physical protection from the vectors of the plant pest;
(b)
there is evidence that the susceptible plants were infected with the plant pest before they were introduced into that area; and
(c)
no vectors carrying the plant pest have been detected in tests carried out in accordance with internationally validated testing methods in the vicinity of those plants.
24.  Where the Scottish Ministers do not demarcate an area for the reasons specified in paragraph 23(a) to (c), they must ensure that annual surveys are carried out for a period of at least two years beginning on the date of their decision not to demarcate the area, in order to determine whether any other plants are or have been infected with the plant pest.
PART F
Lifting of demarcation
25.  The Scottish Ministers may lift the demarcation that applies to a demarcated area if—
(a)
the plant pest is not detected in the demarcated area over a period of five years in official surveys carried out pursuant to paragraph 1(e) of schedule 12A or by the monitoring referred to in paragraph 16(g); and
(b)
where the buffer zone has been reduced in accordance with paragraph 7, one year after the date of its initial establishment if the following conditions are met—
(i)
the measures described in paragraphs 7(a) to (d) have been taken and, as a result, the Scottish Ministers are able to conclude with a high degree of confidence that the initial presence of the plant pest was an isolated case and no further spread has occurred in the demarcated area; and
(i)
as close as practically possible to the time of lifting, official tests have been carried out in the demarcated area in accordance with international standards, which targeted symptomatic plants and asymptomatic plants in the proximity of the symptomatic plants.
26.  Where the demarcation of an area is lifted under paragraph 25(b), the Scottish Ministers must ensure that the susceptible plants located in that area are subject to intensive surveys for a period of two years following the date of the lifting of the demarcation.
27.  Those surveys must—
(a)
be carried out in accordance with international standards;

(d)
in any case where the Scottish Ministers conclude that the felling and disposal of any infested plant, any plant with symptoms caused by the plant pest or any susceptible plant within a radius of 100 m of an infested plant would not be appropriate due to the particular social, cultural or environmental value of the plant, regular detailed examination of any sign of infestation and the application of measures equivalent to its felling and disposal to prevent any possible spread of the plant pest from the plant;
(e)
the prohibition of any movement of potentially infested plants out of the demarcated area;
(f)
the tracing back to the origin of the infestation and the tracing of plants and wood associated with the infestation as far as possible, along with examinations of the plants and wood traced for any sign that they are infested with the plant pest, which must include targeted destructive sampling;
(g)
where appropriate, the replacement of susceptible plants by other plants;
(h)

the following measures—
(i)
the felling of all infested plants and plants with symptoms caused by the plant pest and the complete removal of their roots if larval galleries are observed below the root collar of the infested plants, at the appropriate time; and
(ii)
the removal, examination and disposal of plants felled in accordance with paragraph (i) and, where necessary, their roots, taking all necessary precautions to avoid the spread of the plant pest after felling; or
(b)
the prohibition of any movement of potentially infested plants out of the demarcated area;
(c)
where appropriate, the replacement of susceptible plants by other plants;
(d)
the prohibition on the planting of susceptible plants in the open air within a radius of 100 m of an infested plant, except in a place of production authorised by the Scottish Ministers;

PART D
Measures to be taken where no demarcated area is established
15.  The Scottish Ministers need not demarcate an area in relation to a finding of the plant pest in Scotland—
(a)
where there is evidence that—
(i)
the infestation has been caused by the movement of susceptible plants or susceptible wood to the area in which the plant pest was found and that the susceptible plants or susceptible wood were infested with the plant pest before that movement; or
(ii)
it is an isolated finding which is not expected to lead to the establishment of the plant pest; and
(b)
where they have ascertained from a specific investigation that the plant pest is not established in the area and that it will not successfully breed or spread due to its biology if appropriate eradication measures are taken.
16.  Where the Scottish Ministers do not demarcate an area for the reasons specified in paragraph 15(a) and (b), they must ensure that—
(a)
measures are taken immediately for the purpose of promptly eradicating the plant pest and preventing its spread;

PART B
Establishment of demarcated area
3.  The Scottish Ministers must by notice and without delay demarcate an area in relation to the infestation consisting of an infested zone and a buffer zone around the infested zone.
4.  The infested zone must include the area in which—
(a)
the plant pest was found;
(b)
all plants known to be infested by the plant pest are located;
(c)
all plants showing signs or symptoms indicating possible infestation by the plant pest are located; and
(d)
all plants which may be or may become infested by the plant pest, including any plants which may be or may become infested with the plant pest due to their susceptibility to the plant pest and their close proximity to infested plants or a common source of production, if known, with infested plants or plants grown from them.
5.  The boundary of the buffer zone—
(a)
must initially be at least two km beyond the boundary of the infested zone, but may be reduced to one km beyond the boundary of the infested zone if the Scottish Ministers conclude that eradication of the plant pest is possible and for so long as they remain of that view; or
(b)
where the Scottish Ministers subsequently conclude in accordance with paragraph 13 that eradication of the plant pest is no longer possible, must be at least four km beyond the boundary of the infested zone.
6.  The demarcation of the infested zone and the buffer zone must be based on sound scientific principles, the biology of the plant pest, the level of infestation, the distribution of susceptible plants and susceptible wood in the area concerned and evidence of establishment of the plant pest.
7.  If there is a confirmed finding of the plant pest in the buffer zone, the Scottish Ministers must amend the original demarcated area in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 6 to take account of that finding.
8.  Paragraph 3 is subject to paragraph 14.
9.  This Part does not apply in so far as any part of the area to be demarcated would be in England.
PART C
Measures to be taken in a demarcated area
10.  Where an area is demarcated under paragraph 3, the Scottish Ministers must ensure that measures are taken within the demarcated area to eradicate the plant pest in the area or, where they have concluded that eradication of the plant pest is no longer possible, to contain the spread of the plant pest from the area.
11.  The eradication measures must include—
(a)
the felling of all infested plants and plants with symptoms caused by the plant pest, and the complete removal of their roots if larval galleries are observed below the root collar of the infested plants, at the appropriate time;
(b)
the felling of all susceptible plants within a radius of 100 m of an infested plant, other than any plant to which sub-paragraph (d) applies, and the examination of those plants for any sign of infestation;
(c)
the removal, examination and disposal of plants felled in accordance with sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), and where necessary their roots, taking all necessary precautions to avoid the spread of the plant pest during and after felling and the examination and disposal of other plant products and wood packaging material;
(d)
in any case where the Scottish Ministers conclude that the felling and disposal of any susceptible plant within a radius of 100 m of an infested plant would not be appropriate due to the particular social, cultural or environmental value of the plant, regular detailed examination of the plant for any sign of infestation and the application of measures equivalent to its felling and disposal to prevent any possible spread of the plant pest from the plant;
(e)
the prohibition of any movement of a susceptible plant, susceptible wood or susceptible wood packaging material which is potentially infested with the plant pest out of the demarcated area;
(f)
the tracing back to the origin of the infestation, and the tracing of plants, wood and wood packaging material associated with the infestation as far as possible, along with examinations of the plants, wood and wood packaging material traced for any sign that they are infested with the plant pest;
(g)
where appropriate, the replacement of susceptible plants by other plant species;
(h)
a prohibition on the planting of susceptible plants in the open air within a radius of 100 m of an infested plant, except in a place of production authorised by the Scottish Ministers;
(i)
intensive surveillance for the presence of the plant pest on species of Prunus L. by annual inspections at appropriate times, with specific focus on the buffer zone, which must include at least one inspection a year and, where appropriate, destructive sampling;
(j)
activities to raise public awareness of the threat of the plant pest and the measures adopted to prevent its introduction into and spread within the relevant UK territory, including the conditions relating to the movement of susceptible plants, susceptible wood and susceptible wood packaging material from the demarcated area;
(k)
where necessary, specific measures to address any particularity or complication that could reasonably be expected to prevent, hinder or delay eradication of the plant pest; and
(l)
any other measure which may contribute to the eradication of the plant pest, taking account of the guidelines in ISPM No. 9 and ISPM No. 14.
12.  The containment measures must include—
(a)
the following measures—
(i)
the felling of all infested plants and plants with symptoms caused by the plant pest and the complete removal of their roots if larval galleries are observed below the root collar of the infested plants, at the appropriate time; and
(ii)
the removal, examination and disposal of plants felled in accordance with paragraph (i) and, where necessary, their roots, taking all necessary precautions to avoid the spread of the plant pest after felling; or
(b)
the prohibition of any movement of susceptible plants which are potentially infested with the plant pest out of the demarcated area;
(c)
where appropriate, the replacement of susceptible plants by other plants;
(d)
the prohibition on the planting of susceptible plants in the open air in the infested zone, except in a place of production authorised by the Scottish Ministers;
(e)
intensive surveillance for the presence of the plant pest on species of Prunus L., with specific focus on the buffer zone, which must include at least one inspection a year and, where appropriate, targeted destructive sampling;
(f)
activities to raise public awareness of the threat of the plant pest and the measures adopted to prevent its introduction into and spread within the relevant UK territory, including the conditions relating to the movement of susceptible plants and susceptible wood from the demarcated area;
(g)
where necessary, specific measures to address any particularity or complication that could reasonably be expected to prevent, hinder or delay containment of the plant pest; and
(j)
any other measure which may contribute to the containment of the plant pest.
13.  The Scottish Ministers may only conclude that it is not possible to eradicate the plant pest from a demarcated area where the results of official surveys carried out over a period of four consecutive years have confirmed the presence of the plant pest in the demarcated area and there is evidence that the plant pest can no longer be eradicated from the area.
PART D
Measures to be taken where no demarcated area is established
14.  The Scottish Ministers need not demarcate an area in relation to a finding of the plant pest in a relevant UK territory where—
(a)
there is evidence—
(i)
that the infestation has been caused by the movement of any susceptible plant, susceptible wood or susceptible wood packaging material to the area in which the plant pest was found and that the susceptible plants, susceptible wood or susceptible wood packaging material was infested with the plant pest before that movement; or
(ii)
that it is an isolated finding, immediately associated with a susceptible plant, susceptible wood or susceptible wood packaging material, which is not expected to lead to the establishment of the plant pest; and
(b)
they have ascertained from a specific investigation that the plant pest is not established in the area and that, due to its biology, it will not successfully breed or spread if appropriate eradication measures are taken.
15.  Where Scottish Ministers do not demarcate an area for the reasons specified in paragraph 14, they must ensure that—
(a)
measures are taken immediately for the purpose of promptly eradicating the plant pest and preventing its spread;
(b)
regular and intensive surveillance is carried out over a period of four consecutive years for the presence of the plant pest in the area which lies within a radius of one km of the infested plants, infested wood or infested wood packaging material or the place where the plant pest was found;
(c)
all infested plants, infested wood and infested wood packaging material are destroyed;
(d)
tracing back to the origin of the infestation and tracing of plants, wood and wood packaging material associated with the infestation is carried out as far as possible, along with examinations of the plants, wood and wood packaging material traced for any sign that they are infested with the plant pest, which must include targeted destructive sampling;
(e)
activities to raise public awareness of the threat posed by the plant pest are carried out; and
(f)
any other measure which may contribute to the eradication of the plant pest, taking account of the guidelines in ISPM No. 9 and ISPM No. 14.
PART E
Authorisation of treatment and processing facilities
16.  Where an area is demarcated under paragraph 3 by the Scottish Ministers and there are no treatment or processing facilities in the demarcated area to treat or process susceptible wood for the purposes of item 11 of Part E of the list of regulated material, or to treat and mark susceptible wood packaging material for the purposes of item 12 of Part E of the list of regulated material, the Scottish Ministers must ensure that any susceptible wood or susceptible wood packaging material is only moved to a facility outside the demarcated area if—
(a)
in the case of susceptible wood, the facility has been authorised to treat susceptible wood for the purposes of item 11 of Part E of the list of regulated material, and the wood is immediately treated or processed at the facility on arrival;
(b)
in the case of susceptible wood packaging material, the facility has been authorised to treat and mark susceptible wood packaging material for the purposes of item 12 of Part E of the list of regulated material and the wood packaging material is immediately treated and marked at the facility on arrival; and
(c)
the movement is carried out under the control of the Scottish Ministers and under closed conditions so as to ensure that the plant pest cannot spread.
17.  The Scottish Ministers must ensure that—
(a)
any facility which is located outside the demarcated area and is authorised to treat susceptible wood for the purposes of item 11 of Part E of the list of regulated material disposes of any waste material in a manner that ensures the plant pest cannot spread;
(b)
intensive surveillance is carried out at appropriate times for the presence of the plant pest through inspections on species of Prunus L, within at least one km of the facility.
PART F
Lifting of demarcation
18.  The Scottish Ministers may lift the demarcation that applies to a demarcated area if the plant pest is not detected in the area over a period of four consecutive years—
(a)
during official surveys carried pursuant to paragraph 1(g) of schedule 12A; and
(b)
in regular and intensive surveillance for the presence of the plant pest carried out in the area lying within a radius of one km of the infested plants, infested wood or infested wood packaging material or the place where the plant pest was found.”.

These Regulations create a scheme under sections 15 and 21 of the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018 (the “Act”) under which the local authorities listed in the schedule of the Act (“relevant local authorities”) may request additional functions, duties or responsibilities (“additional powers”) from the Scottish Ministers. They also set out the period within which the Scottish Ministers must give notice of their decision, provide for the information which the decision notice must contain and set out actions to be taken where the Scottish Ministers decide to give effect to an additional powers request.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014 created a new structure for tribunals dealing with devolved matters under the judicial leadership of the Lord President of the Court of Session as head of the Scottish Tribunals.
It provides for a First-tier Tribunal for Scotland divided into chambers and an Upper Tribunal for Scotland divided into divisions.
The First-tier Tribunal for Scotland General Regulatory Chamber Parking and Bus Lane Appeals (Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2020 provide for the rules of procedure to apply in the General Regulatory Chamber when hearing appeals against decisions of a local authority to issue parking penalty charge notices or bus lane charge notices.
The First-tier Tribunal for Scotland General Regulatory Chamber Parking and Bus Lane Cases and Upper Tribunal for Scotland (Composition) Regulations 2020 provide for the composition of the General Regulatory Chamber and the Upper Tribunal when dealing with parking cases and bus lane cases.
These Regulations amend both sets of Regulations to enable the General Regulatory Chamber and the Upper Tribunal to hear appeals against decisions of a local authority to issue penalty charge notices relating to low emission zone schemes, double parking prohibitions, pavement parking prohibitions, dropped footway parking prohibitions and workplace parking licensing schemes. This reflects changes introduced under the Transport (Scotland) Act 2019.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

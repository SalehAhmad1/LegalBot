if later, the earliest date in relation to which, if the individual’s ability to carry out daily living activities or, as the case may be, mobility activities, had been determined on every day in the previous 13 weeks, it is likely that the Scottish Ministers would have determined on all of those days that the individual has limited ability or, as the case may be, severely limited ability to carry out those activities, and
(b)
where the individual has an award of either or both components, each day of that award.The relevant date: Adult Disability Payment after an interval
14.—(1) This regulation does not apply where regulation 23 (Adult Disability Payment after an interval and after reaching the relevant age) applies.
(2) Paragraphs (3) and (4) apply where—
(a)
an individual makes an application for Adult Disability Payment (“the application”),
(b)
that individual had a previous award of—
(i)
Adult Disability Payment,
(ii)
Child Disability Payment,
(iii)
Disability Living Allowance, or
(iv)
Personal Independence Payment,
which ended not more than two years before the date on which the application is made,
(c)
the previous award referred to in sub-paragraph (b) consisted of the same component as the one to which the individual is entitled (or would be entitled if the individual met the required period condition) under the application, and
(d)
the Scottish Ministers determine that the entitlement under the application results from—
(i)
substantially the same physical or mental condition or conditions for which the previous award was made, or
(ii)
a new physical or mental condition or conditions which developed as a result of a condition for which the previous award was made.
(3) In relation to determination of entitlement under the application, the relevant date for the purpose of regulation 10(3) is the date on which the previous award ended.

(i)
the care component of Child Disability Payment,
(ii)
the care component of Disability Living Allowance, or
(iii)
the daily living component of Personal Independence Payment,
(b)
an award of any of the following is to be treated as though it were an award of the mobility component of Adult Disability Payment—
(i)
the mobility component of Child Disability Payment,
(ii)
the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance, or
(iii)
the mobility component of Personal Independence Payment.Residence and presence conditions
15.—(1) An individual satisfies the residence and presence conditions where on any day that individual—

(c)
is not a person subject to immigration control within the meaning of section 115(9) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999(1),
(d)
is present in the common travel area, and
(e)
has been present in the common travel area for a period of, or for periods amounting in the aggregate to, not less than 26 weeks out of the 52 weeks immediately preceding that day.
(2) In this Part, “common travel area” has the meaning given in section 1(3) of the Immigration Act 1971(2).
(3) The residence condition set out in paragraph (1)(a) does not apply in relation to the daily living component where on any day the individual—
(a)
is habitually resident in Ireland,

is an individual—
(i)
to whom the Convention on Social Security between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland signed at Dublin on 1 February 2019(3), as modified from time to time in accordance with any provision of it, applies, and
(ii)
in respect of whom the United Kingdom is, as a result, competent for payment of long term care benefits.
(4) The reference in paragraph (3)(b) to an individual’s link to Scotland being sufficient is to it being sufficiently close that if the individual were not entitled to Adult Disability Payment, paragraph (3) would be incompatible with the Convention on Social Security between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland signed at Dublin on 1 February 2019.
(5) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply to a person subject to immigration control within the meaning of section 115(9) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 where the person—
(a)
is lawfully working in United Kingdom and is a national of a state with which the United Kingdom has concluded an agreement which replaces in whole or in part an agreement under Article 217 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union(4) which has ceased to apply to, and in, the United Kingdom, providing, in the field of social security, for the equal treatment of workers who are nationals of the signatory state and their families,
(b)
is a member of the family of, and living with, a person specified in sub-paragraph (a), or
(c)
has been given leave to enter, or remain in, the United Kingdom by the Secretary of State upon an undertaking by another person or persons pursuant to the immigration rules, to be responsible for their maintenance and accommodation.
(6) The past presence condition in paragraph (1)(e) does not apply where an individual has a terminal illness within the meaning of regulation 26.
(7) The residence and presence conditions set out in paragraphs (1)(b) and (1)(e) do not apply where an individual is a person who—
(a)
has leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom granted under the immigration rules by virtue of—
(i)

(ii)
the previous scheme for locally-employed staff in Afghanistan (sometimes referred to as the ex-gratia scheme),
(b)
has been granted discretionary leave outside the immigration rules as a dependant of a person referred to in sub-paragraph (a), or
(c)
has leave granted under the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme.
(8) For the purposes of paragraph (7), “the Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme” means the scheme announced by the United Kingdom Government on 18 August 2021(5).

following the determination under sub-paragraph (1) a further determination is to be made under paragraph 12.

may be made on the assumption that whatever can be discerned about the transferring individual’s circumstances from the information mentioned in sub-paragraph (3) remains accurate on the date on which the determination is made,

(i)
within one month of the change occurring, the date when the individual first satisfies the requirements for a higher rate of the care or mobility component,

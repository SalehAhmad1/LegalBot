DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Equality Act 2010 (Specific Duties) (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (“the 2012 Regulations”) by adding ILF Scotland to the public authorities listed.
ILF Scotland is listed in paragraph (1) of new regulation 2B, which is inserted into the 2012 Regulations by regulation 5 of these Regulations. Regulation 5 also modifies the 2012 Regulations in their application to ILF Scotland so as to provide different dates by which certain duties have to be complied with. Regulations 3 and 4 of these Regulations make consequential changes to the definition of “listed authority” in regulation 2 of the 2012 Regulations and to regulation 2A of the 2012 Regulations.
Regulation 6 amends regulation 8A of the 2012 Regulations to provide different dates by which publication is to take place by ILF Scotland under regulations 7(1) and 8(1) of the 2012 Regulations, and to add a further category of “relevant period” for the purposes of regulation 8A(3) of the 2012 Regulations.

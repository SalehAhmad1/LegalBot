DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These regulations modify the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 (“the 2022 Act”) to change the date when section 10 and, by consequence, schedule 3 of the Act expire.
Schedule 3 of the 2022 Act confers powers on the Scottish Ministers on or in anticipation of the expiry or suspension of the rent controls imposed by paragraph 1 of schedule 1 of the Act, to modify how rent is to be determined by a rent officer or the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland.
Regulation 2 of these regulations provides that, instead of expiring at the end of 31 March 2024, section 10 and schedule 3 of the 2022 Act will expire one year later (i.e. at the end of 31 March 2025).
Regulation 3 makes a consequential amendment to section 11(1) of the 2022 Act to reflect this change.

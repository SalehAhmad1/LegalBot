EUR 2012/231, to which there are amendments not relevant to these Regulations.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to assimilated direct legislation relating to the marketing of wine and oenological practices used to produce and conserve wine and other wine products. They extend to Scotland.
These Regulations amend Article 53 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/33 of 17 October 2018 supplementing Regulation (EU) No1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards applications for protection of designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional terms in the wine sector, the objection procedure, restrictions of use, amendments to product specifications, cancellation of protection, and labelling and presentation (“EUR 2019/33”). The amendment inserts a provision in EUR 2019/33 prohibiting the marketing of a product using the term “ice wine”, “icewine” or “ice-wine” (whether in English or a different language) and similar terms (whether in English or a different language), unless the product is a wine made exclusively from grapes naturally frozen on the vine (regulation 2).
These Regulations also amend Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/934 of 12 March 2019 supplementing Regulation (EU) No1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards wine-growing areas where the alcoholic strength may be increased, authorised oenological practices and restrictions applicable to the production and conservation of grapevine products, the minimum percentage of alcohol for by-products and their disposal, and publication of OIV files (“EUR 2019/934”) (regulation 3 and the schedule).
EUR 2019/934 authorises specified oenological practices. It supplements Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) No1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (“EUR 2013/1308”). Article 80(1) of EUR 2013/1308 prohibits the use of unauthorised oenological practices in the production and conservation of wine and other wine products. The amendments made by this instrument to EUR 2019/934 make changes to the oenological practices that may be used in the production and conservation of wine and other wine products.

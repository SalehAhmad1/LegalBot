DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulations 4(2) and 5(2) of the Registration of Social Workers and Social Service Workers in Care Services (Scotland) Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”) to amend the time within which (respectively) social workers and social services workers starting work must apply to register with the Scottish Social Services Council.
Such workers must now apply for registration within 3 months (rather than “as soon as possible”) after starting work. The 2013 Regulations still provide for a period of grace of 6 months from starting work for registration to take place. In the case of social service workers, the obligation to register also applies where they start work as a different description of social service worker (the descriptions of social service worker being prescribed by the Regulation of Care (Social Service Workers) (Scotland) Order 2024).

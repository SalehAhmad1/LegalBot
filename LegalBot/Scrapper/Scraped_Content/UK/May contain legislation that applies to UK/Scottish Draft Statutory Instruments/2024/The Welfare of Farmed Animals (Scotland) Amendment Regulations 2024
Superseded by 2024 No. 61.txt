DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Welfare of Farmed Animals (Scotland) Regulations 2010 (“the 2010 Regulations”). These Regulations insert a new sub-paragraph into regulation 7A(2) of the 2010 Regulations.
Regulation 7A (animal welfare guidance) of the 2010 Regulations provides that a person responsible for a farmed animal must not attend to that animal unless that person is acquainted with any relevant animal welfare guidance and has access to it while attending to that animal. The person responsible must also take all reasonable steps to ensure that any other person employed or engaged by the person responsible does not attend to any such animal, unless that other person is acquainted with any relevant animal welfare guidance, has access to a copy of it while attending to the animal, and has received instruction on how to comply with the guidance.
These Regulations add a document titled “Guidance for the Welfare of Pigs” to the definition of “animal welfare guidance” found in regulation 7A(2) of the 2010 Regulations. A copy of the document can be viewed on, or downloaded from, the Scottish Government’s website. Copies of the document can be provided following request to the Scottish Government’s Agriculture and Rural Economy Directorate, Animal Health and Welfare Division.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

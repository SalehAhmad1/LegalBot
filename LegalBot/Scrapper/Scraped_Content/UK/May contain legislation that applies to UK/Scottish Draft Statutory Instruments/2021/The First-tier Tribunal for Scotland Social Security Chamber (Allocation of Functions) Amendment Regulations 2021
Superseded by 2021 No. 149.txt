DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Allocation of Functions to the Social Security Chamber) Regulations 2018 (“the 2018 Regulations”) and the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Social Security Chamber (Procedure and Allocation of Functions) Amendment Regulations 2020 (“the 2020 Regulations”) to further extend the period for which certain provisions of the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014 (“the 2014 Act”) will not apply in relation to the presidency of the First-tier Tribunal Social Security Chamber.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 5 of the 2018 Regulations to extend the period for which section 21(2) of the 2014 Act, and certain related provisions in schedule 4 of that Act, will not apply in relation to the presidency of that Chamber. This has the effect of extending the period for which the assignment to that Chamber of a president who is also the president of another chamber of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland is permitted. The period is extended until 31 March 2024.
Regulation 3 omits regulation 2 of the 2020 Regulations, which had previously amended regulation 5 of the 2018 Regulations to extend the period until 31 March 2021. That amendment is superseded by regulation 2 of these Regulations.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

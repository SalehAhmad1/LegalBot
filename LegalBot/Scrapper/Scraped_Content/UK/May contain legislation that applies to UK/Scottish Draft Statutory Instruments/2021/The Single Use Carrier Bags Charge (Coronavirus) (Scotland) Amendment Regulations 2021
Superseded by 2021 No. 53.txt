DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Single Use Carrier Bags Charge (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(1) amends regulation 7(2) of the 2014 Regulations by replacing the date on which the provision ceases to have effect with 31 May 2021. The exemption to the requirement to charge for the supply of a single use carrier bag in regulation 7(2) had ceased to have effect on 3 October 2020. The amendment to regulation 7(2) means that, from the coming into force of these Regulations until 0001 hours on 31 May 2021, the requirement to charge in regulation 6 of the 2014 Regulations does not apply in relation to the supply of a single use carrier bag if the bag is used for a purpose described in paragraph 1A of the schedule of the 2014 Regulations.
The urgent nature of the instrument means it has not been possible to prepare a Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment.

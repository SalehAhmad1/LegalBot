20.—(1) A reference to the voting rights in an overseas entity is to the rights conferred on shareholders in respect of their shares (or, in the case of an entity not having a share capital, on members) to vote at general meetings of the entity on all or substantially all matters.
(2) In relation to an overseas entity that does not have general meetings at which matters are decided by the exercise of voting rights—

21.—(1) A reference to a power to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors of an overseas entity is a reference to the right to appoint or remove directors holding a majority of the voting rights at meetings of the board on all or substantially all matters.
(2) References to a board of directors, in the case of an overseas entity that does not have such a board, are to be read as references to the equivalent management board of that entity.

(a)
holds that right, or
(b)
is part of a chain of legal entities—
(i)
each of which (other than the last) has a majority stake in the entity immediately below it in the chain, and
(ii)
the last of which holds that right.
(2) For these purposes, a person (“A”) has a “majority stake” in a legal entity (“B”) if—
(a)
A holds a majority of the voting rights in B,
(b)
A is a member of B and has the power to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors of B,
(c)
A is a member of B and controls alone, pursuant to an agreement with other shareholders or members, a majority of the voting rights in B, or
(d)
A has the right to exercise, or actually exercises, control over B.
(3) In the application of this paragraph to the power to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors, a legal entity is to be treated as having the right to appoint a director if—
(a)
a person’s appointment as a director follows necessarily from that person’s appointment as director of the legal entity, or
(b)
the directorship is held by the legal entity itself.
23.—(1) Where a person controls a right, the right is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as held by that person (and not by the person who in fact holds the right, unless that person also controls it).
(2) A person “controls” a right if, by virtue of any arrangement between that person and others, the right is exercisable only—
(a)
by that person, in accordance with that person’s directions or instructions, or
(b)
with that person’s consent or concurrence.
24.—(1) Rights that are exercisable only in certain circumstances are to be taken into account only—
(a)
when the circumstances have arisen, and for so long as they are extant, or
(b)
when whether the circumstances arise or not are within the control of the person having the rights.
(2) But rights that are exercisable by an administrator or by creditors while a legal entity is in relevant insolvency proceedings are not to be taken into account even while the entity is in those proceedings.
(3) “Relevant insolvency proceedings” means—
(a)
administration within the meaning of the Insolvency Act 1986(5), or
(b)
proceedings under the insolvency law of another country or territory during which an entity’s assets and affairs are subject to the control or supervision of a third party or creditor.
(4) Rights that are normally exercisable but which are temporarily incapable of exercise are to continue to be taken into account.
25.—(1) An individual does not meet a condition mentioned in paragraph 12 in relation to an overseas entity by virtue only of being a foreign limited partner.
(2) An individual does not meet a condition mentioned in paragraph 12 in relation to an overseas entity by virtue only of directly or indirectly holding a right in, or in relation to a foreign limited partner which (in its capacity as such) would meet the condition if it were an individual.
(3) Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply for the purposes of determining whether the requirement set out in the condition mentioned in paragraph 12(b)(iii) is met.
(4) In this paragraph “foreign limited partner” means an individual who—
(a)
participates in a foreign limited partnership as a limited liability participant, or
(b)
directly or indirectly, holds shares or a right in or in relation to a legal entity which participates in a foreign limited partnership as a limited liability participant.
(5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
a “foreign limited partnership” is an arrangement which—
(i)
is established under the law of a country or territory outwith the United Kingdom,
(ii)
consists of at least one person who has unlimited liability for the debts and obligations of the arrangement, and
(iii)
consists of at least one person who has no, or limited, liability for the debts and obligations of the arrangement so long as that person does not take part in the management of the arrangement’s business,
(b)
a “limited liability participant” is a person who—
(i)
has no, or limited, liability for the debts and obligations of the foreign limited partnership for so long as that person does not take part in the management of the foreign limited partnership’s business, and
(ii)

(a)
has a significantly greater difficulty in learning than the majority of others of the same age, or
(b)
has a disability for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010 (c. 15) which prevents or hinders him or her from making use of facilities for education or training of a kind generally provided for others of the same age in mainstream maintained schools or mainstream institutions in the further education sector.
(3)
A child under compulsory school age has a learning difficulty or disability if he or she is, or would be if no additional learning provision were made, likely to be within subsection (2) when of compulsory school age.
(4)
A person does not have a learning difficulty or disability solely because the language (or form of language) in which he or she is or will be taught is different from a language (or form of language) which is or has been used at home.

Review and revision of individual development plans
(1)
A governing body or a local authority required to maintain an individual development plan must review it before the end of each review period.
(2)
The first review period is a period of 12 months starting with the date on which a copy of the plan is given under section 22.
(3)
Each subsequent review period is a period of 12 months starting with—
(a)
the date during the preceding review period on which a copy of a revised plan is given under subsection (11) in relation to that review period, or
(b)
where the plan has not been revised in the preceding review period—
(i)
the date during that preceding review period on which notice of a decision is given under subsection (10) in relation to that review period, or
(ii)
the date during that preceding review period on which notice of a decision is given under section 27(4) in relation to that review period.
(4)
But where none of the documents referred to in subsection (3)(a) and (b) has been given during the preceding review period, the subsequent review period is a period of 12 months starting with the first day after the end of that preceding review period.
(5)
Where a copy of a plan, revised plan or notice of decision is required to be given to more than one person, the reference in subsections (2) and (3) to the date on which it is given is a reference to the date on which the plan, revised plan or notice of decision is first given.
(6)
The duty in subsection (1) to review a plan before the end of a review period is treated as met if, before the end of that period—
(a)
the plan is reconsidered by a local authority under section 27,
(b)
the Education Tribunal for Wales orders a governing body or a local authority to revise the plan, or
(c)
in the case of a plan maintained by the governing body of a maintained school, the Education Tribunal for Wales orders a local authority to review the plan.
(7)
A governing body or local authority must review an individual development plan it is required to maintain if—
(a)
the plan includes additional learning provision that an NHS body is required to secure under section 20, and
(b)
the NHS body asks it to review the plan.
(8)
A governing body or a local authority required to maintain an individual development plan for a child or young person must review the plan if a request is made to it by the child, the child's parent or the young person, unless it considers a review to be unnecessary.
(9)
A governing body or local authority may—
(a)
review an individual development plan at any time, and
(b)
revise a plan following a review.
(10)
If a governing body or a local authority decides following a review (required or authorised by or under this Part) that the plan should not be revised it must notify the child or young person and, in the case of a child, the child's parent of—
(a)
the decision, and
(b)
the reasons for the decision.
(11)
If a governing body or a local authority revises an individual development plan (as required or authorised by or under this Part), it must give a copy of the revised plan to—
(a)
the child or young person, and
(b)
if the plan is for a child, the child's parent.
(12)
This section does not apply if an individual development plan relates to a child who is looked after by a local authority, unless the child is in the area of a local authority in England.

(2)
This section also applies where an individual development plan is prepared under section 40(5).

But the duty in subsection (3) does not apply where the detained person is a young person who does not consent to the individual development plan being kept.
(5)
Nor does the duty in subsection (3) apply in relation to an individual development plan that was being maintained by the governing body of a maintained school or an institution in the further education sector, or by a local authority other than the home authority, unless the fact that the plan was being maintained is brought to the attention of the home authority.

The home authority must inform the detained person and the parent of a detained person who is a child that it is keeping an individual development plan while the person is detained in relevant youth accommodation.
(7)
The home authority must give a copy of the individual development plan to the person in charge of the relevant youth accommodation.

Duty to favour education for children at mainstream maintained schools
(1)
A local authority exercising functions under this Part in relation to a child of compulsory school age with additional learning needs who should be educated in a school must secure that the child is educated in a mainstream maintained school unless any of the circumstances in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (2) apply.
(2)
The circumstances are—

(c)
that the child's parent wishes the child to be educated otherwise than in a mainstream maintained school.
(3)
A local authority may not rely on the exception in subsection (2)(a) unless there are no reasonable steps the authority could take to prevent the incompatibility.
(4)
Where a child's parent wishes his or her child to be educated otherwise than in a mainstream maintained school, subsection (2)(c) does not require a local authority to secure that the child is educated otherwise than in a mainstream maintained school.

an independent school, or
(b)
a school approved under section 342 of the Education Act 1996 (c. 56),
if the cost is met otherwise than by a local authority.

Section 12 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (c. 15) (proceedings on appeal to the Upper Tribunal) applies in relation to appeals to the Upper Tribunal under this paragraph as it applies in relation to appeals to it under section 11 of that Act, but as if references to the First-tier Tribunal were references to the Welsh Tribunal.”

“6A
(1)

(5)
In this paragraph “the relevant time” means the time at which, under this Act, something is required or permitted to be done by or in relation to a parent or a person over compulsory school age.

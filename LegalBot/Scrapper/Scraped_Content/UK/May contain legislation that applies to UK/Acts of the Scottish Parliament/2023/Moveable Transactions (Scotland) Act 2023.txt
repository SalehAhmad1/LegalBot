Assignation of claims: general
(1)
The assignation of a claim requires the execution or authentication of a document assigning the claim (an “assignation document”) by the person assigning it.
(2)
The assignation document must identify the claim.
(3)
But an assignation document which assigns a number of claims need not identify each claim separately provided that the document identifies the claims in terms of their constituting an identifiable class.
(4)
It is competent to assign a claim which, at the time the assignation document is granted, is not held by the assignor (whether or not the claim yet exists at that time).
(5)
For the purposes of subsection (2), the ways in which the claim can be identified in the assignation document include by making reference in the assignation document to another document, the terms of which are not reproduced.
(6)
Nothing in this Part applies to the assignation of a claim as part of a financial collateral arrangement, within the meaning of regulation 3(1) of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No.2) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/3226).

Seriously misleading inaccuracies in the assignations record
(1)
In determining for the purpose of section 27(1)(a)(ii) whether an entry in the assignations record is seriously misleading as a result of an inaccuracy or inaccuracies in it—

(b)
any inaccuracy is to be disregarded to the extent that it appears in the assignation document but is not replicated elsewhere in the entry,
(c)
where the entry is seriously misleading in respect of only part of the assigned claim, that is not to be taken to affect the entry in its application to the rest of the claim,
(d)
where the entry is seriously misleading in respect of a co-assignor or co-assignee but not in respect of both (or all) co-assignors or co-assignees, that is not to be taken to affect the entry in its application to a co-assignor or co-assignee in respect of whom the entry is not seriously misleading.

(a)
there is a requirement, by virtue of section 21(1)(g), for an entry in the assignations record to specify the type of claim assigned, and

Assignee’s duty to respond to request for information
(1)

(a)
it is manifest that the registration is ineffective in relation to the assignation of the claim to which the request relates,

extend the period within which the registered assignee must comply with the request by such number of days as it specifies in the order,
if satisfied that in all the circumstances it would be reasonable to do so.

the issue, under section 26(1), of a written statement which is incorrect,
(c)
the service, under section 30(3), of a notification which is incorrect,
(d)
a search result which—
(i)
relates to a search of the assignations record carried out by means of a search facility provided by the Keeper,
(ii)
ought (as a result of the search terms used) to reflect accurately the contents of the assignations record at the time the search was made, and

(e)
the issue, under section 35, of an extract which is not a true extract,

in so far as the person’s loss could have been avoided had the person taken measures which it would have been reasonable for the person to take,
(b)
in so far as the person’s loss was not reasonably foreseeable, or
(c)
for non-patrimonial loss.
(3)
For the avoidance of doubt, an inaccuracy in information included in an entry in the assignations record when that entry is made up under section 25(1)(a) or corrected under section 29 does not fall within subsection (1)(a) to the extent that the Keeper—
(a)
has been misled into making the inaccuracy, and
(b)
reasonably believed the information to be accurate.
(4)
For the purposes of subsection (3), the circumstances where the Keeper is entitled to reasonably believe information to be accurate include those where it is provided—

(i)
the person who made the application for registration which gave rise to the inaccurate entry if that person failed to take reasonable care in making it, or
(ii)
where the inaccurate entry arises from the attempted correction of an apparent inaccuracy, the person who notified the Keeper of the apparent inaccuracy if that person failed to take reasonable care in doing so,
(b)
where P suffers loss in consequence of an inaccuracy in information supplied in response to a request under section 36(1), P is entitled to be compensated for that loss by the person who supplied the information if that person failed to take reasonable care in supplying it, or
(c)
where P suffers loss in consequence of a failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with a request in accordance with section 36(4), P is entitled to be compensated for that loss by the person whose failure it was.

But a person has no liability under subsection (1)—
(a)
in so far as P’s loss could have been avoided had P taken measures which it would have been reasonable for P to take,

Seriously misleading inaccuracies in the statutory pledges record
(1)
In determining for the purposes of sections 91(1)(a)(ii), 92(1)(a)(ii) and 93(3) whether an entry in the statutory pledges record is seriously misleading as a result of an inaccuracy or inaccuracies in it—
(a)
the entry is seriously misleading where—
(i)
any of subsections (2) to (6) apply, or
(ii)
despite sub-paragraph (i) not being satisfied, the inaccuracy or inaccuracies are such that a reasonable person would be seriously misled by the entry,
(b)
any inaccuracy is to be disregarded to the extent that it appears in the constitutive document, or in any amendment document, but is not replicated elsewhere in the entry,
(c)
where the entry is seriously misleading in respect of only part of the encumbered property, that is not to be taken to affect the entry in its application to the rest of the property,
(d)
where the entry is seriously misleading in respect of a co-provider or co-secured creditor but not in respect of both (or all) co-providers or co-secured creditors, that is not to be taken to affect the entry in its application to a co-provider or co-secured creditor in respect of whom the entry is not seriously misleading.
(2)
This subsection applies where—
(a)
the provider is a person required by RSP Rules to be identified in the statutory pledges record by an identifying number, and
(b)
if a search of the record were to be carried out for that number, using the search facility provided under section 104, it would not disclose the entry.
(3)
This subsection applies where—
(a)
the provider is not a person required by RSP Rules to be identified in the statutory pledges record by an identifying number, and
(b)
if a search of the record were to be carried out, using the search facility provided under section 104, for—
(i)
the provider’s proper name, or
(ii)
the provider’s proper name together with the provider’s month and year of birth,
it would not disclose the entry.
(4)
This subsection applies—
(a)
for the purposes of sections 91(1)(a)(ii) and 92(1)(a)(ii) only, and
(b)
where the entry inaccurately reflects the secured creditor’s proper name at the date the application for registration was made in such a way that a reasonable person would be seriously misled.
(5)
This subsection applies where—
(a)
the encumbered property is or includes property required by RSP Rules to be identified in the statutory pledges record by an identifying number, and
(b)
if a search of the record were to be carried out for that number, using the search facility provided under section 104, it would not disclose the entry.
(6)
This subsection applies where—
(a)
there is a requirement, by virtue of section 83(1)(g), for an entry in the statutory pledges record to specify the type of property encumbered, and
(b)
the entry—
(i)
does not describe the property as being of a type that it is, or
(ii)
fails to allocate a type to the property.
(7)
In the application of this section to co-providers and co-secured creditors—
(a)
subsections (2) and (3) apply in relation to a co-provider as they apply in relation to a provider,
(b)
subsection (4) applies in relation to a co-secured creditor as it applies in relation to a secured creditor.
(8)
The Scottish Ministers may by regulations modify this section to make provision about what does, and what does not, make an entry seriously misleading for the purposes of sections 91(1)(a)(ii), 92(1)(a)(ii) and 93(3) and how that is to be determined.
(9)
In this section, the “proper name” of a provider or secured creditor means the person’s name in the form determined in accordance with RSP Rules.

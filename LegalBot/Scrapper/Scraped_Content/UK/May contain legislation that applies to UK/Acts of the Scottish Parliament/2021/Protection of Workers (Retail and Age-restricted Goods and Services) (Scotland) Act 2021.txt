(3)
A person who commits an offence under subsection (1) is liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum (or both).

The offence under section 1 of threatening or abusing a retail worker is committed by a person only if the person—

intends by the behaviour to cause the worker or any other person fear or alarm or is reckless as to whether the behaviour would cause such fear or alarm.
(2)

behaviour of any kind including, in particular, things said or otherwise communicated as well as things done,
(b)
behaviour consisting of—

a course of conduct.3
Aggravation in relation to enforcement of statutory age restriction

This section applies where, in proceedings for an offence under section 1, it is—
(a)
specified in the complaint that the offence is aggravated by reason of the retail worker's enforcing a statutory age restriction, and
(b)
proved that the offence is so aggravated.
(2)
The offence is so aggravated if the behaviour constituting the offence occurred because of the enforcement of a statutory age restriction.
(3)
Evidence from a single source is sufficient to prove that the offence is so aggravated.

Where this section applies, the court must—
(a)
state on conviction that the offence is so aggravated,
(b)
record the conviction in a way that shows that the offence is so aggravated,
(c)
take the aggravation into account in determining the appropriate sentence, and
(d)
state—
(i)
where the sentence imposed in respect of the offence is different from that which the court would have imposed if the offence were not so aggravated, the extent of and the reasons for that difference, or

seeking information as to a person's age,
(b)
considering information as to a person's age,

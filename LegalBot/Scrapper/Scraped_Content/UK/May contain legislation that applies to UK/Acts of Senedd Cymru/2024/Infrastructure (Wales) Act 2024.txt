Transitional and saving provision
(1)
Sections 19 and 20 have no effect in relation to a development if the conditions in subsections (2) and (3) apply.
(2)
The first condition is that—
(a)
an application for a section 20 consent in relation to the development was made before the coming into force of sections 19 and 20 and the application has not been withdrawn,
(b)
a notification under section 62E(1) of the TCPA 1990 of a proposed application in relation to the development was made before the coming into force of sections 19 and 20 and the notification has not been withdrawn, or
(c)
on the coming into force of sections 19 and 20, the making or confirmation of an order or scheme mentioned in subsection (2) or (3) of section 20 in relation to the development is under consideration by the Welsh Ministers, other than in response to an application.

The second condition is that—
(a)
the question of whether to grant or make the section 20 consent is under consideration, where the transition period has not ended,
(b)

(i)
the first 12 months of the transition period has not ended without an application for planning permission being made in relation to the development, or

(8)
If the original consent, or a section 20 consent that replaces it, is varied or replaced, section 19 does not apply to the development to which the consent as varied, or the replacement consent, relates (and so infrastructure consent is not required for that development).
(9)
A section 20 consent replaces an earlier section 20 consent for the purposes of this section if (but only if)—
(a)
it is granted or made on an application for consent for development without complying with conditions subject to which the earlier section 20 consent was granted or made, and
(b)
it is granted subject to, or made on, different conditions or unconditionally.
(10)
The provisions of the TCPA 1990 have effect as if the amendments made to that Act by paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 had not been made in so far as the provisions of the TCPA 1990 relate to a development to which sections 19 and 20 do not apply by virtue of this section.147

(b)
if they apportion the compensation, must give details of the apportionment to the claimant and to any other person with an interest in land which the Welsh Ministers consider is substantially affected by the apportionment.
(2)
In carrying out an apportionment, the Welsh Ministers must divide the land into parts and distribute the compensation for depreciation between those parts according to how they consider different parts of the land are differently affected by the order in consequence of which the compensation is payable.

notify the parties of its decision.
(6)
Where on a reference to the Upper Tribunal it is shown that an apportionment—

(7)

4
(1)
Where compensation becomes payable which includes compensation for depreciation of‍ more than the minimum amount specified in regulations under paragraph 2 the Welsh Ministers must cause notice of that fact (a “compensation notice”) to be served—
(a)
on the council of the county or county borough for the area in which the land or any part of the land to which the notice relates is situated, and

the order in consequence of which the compensation is payable and the land to which the claim for compensation relates, and
(b)
the amount of the compensation and any apportionment of it under paragraph 3.

5
(1)
A person must not carry out development to which this paragraph applies on land in respect of which a compensation notice has been registered until any amount that is recoverable in respect of the compensation specified in the notice by virtue of paragraph 6 has been paid or secured to the satisfaction of the Welsh Ministers in accordance with paragraph 7.
(2)
This paragraph applies to—

(c)
development to which, having regard to the probable value of the development, the Welsh Ministers consider it reasonable that this paragraph should apply.

(4)
Where the compensation specified in the compensation notice became payable in consequence of an order changing an infrastructure consent order, this paragraph does not apply to development in accordance with the changed infrastructure consent order.Amount recoverable by Welsh Ministers in respect of compensation
6
(1)
The amount recoverable in respect of the compensation specified in a registered compensation notice is—
(a)
if the land on which development is to be carried out includes all of the land to which the notice relates (whether alone or with other land), the amount of compensation specified in the notice;
(b)
if the land on which development is to be carried out includes only part of the land to which the notice relates (whether alone or with land to which the notice does not relate), the amount of the compensation specified in the notice that is attributable to that part.
(2)
But the Welsh Ministers may defer recovery of all or part of the amount that would otherwise be recoverable in connection with a particular development of land if they consider, having regard to the probable value of any proper development of that land, that no proper development of it is likely to be carried out unless they exercise their powers under this sub-paragraph.
(3)
If the Welsh Ministers defer recovery of only part of the amount that would otherwise be recoverable in respect of any land, they must cause the registered compensation notice in question to be amended so that the amount of compensation stated in it, so far as attributable to that land, is the amount they have deferred.
(4)
Where an amount has become recoverable in respect of compensation in connection with the development of land, no amount is recoverable in respect of the compensation attributable to that land in connection with any later development of it.
(5)
Sub-paragraph (4) does not apply to an amount to the extent that recovery of the amount was deferred in connection with the earlier development.
(6)
No amount is recoverable by virtue of this paragraph in respect of any compensation by reference to which an amount has become recoverable from an acquiring authority under paragraph 8 (recovery on compulsory acquisition or sale).
(7)
For the purposes of this Schedule, the amount of the compensation specified in a compensation notice that is attributable to a part of the land to which the notice relates is to be calculated—
(a)
if the notice includes an apportionment of the compensation between different parts of the land under paragraph 3, on the basis that—
(i)
the compensation is distributed between those parts in accordance with the apportionment, and
(ii)
the compensation attributed to each part is distributed evenly by area over that part;
(b)
if the notice does not include an apportionment, on the basis that the compensation is distributed evenly by area over the land to which the notice relates.Payment etc. of amount recoverable
7
(1)
An amount recoverable by virtue of paragraph 6 in connection with the development of land is payable to the Welsh Ministers—
(a)
as a single capital payment,
(b)
as a series of instalments of capital and interest combined, or
(c)
as a series of other annual or periodical payments, of the amounts, and payable at the times, that the Welsh Ministers direct.
(2)
Before giving a direction under sub-paragraph (1)(c), the Welsh Ministers must take into account any representations made by the person by whom the development is to be carried out.
(3)
If the amount payable under sub-paragraph (1) is not paid as a single capital payment, it must be secured by the person by whom the development is to be carried out in the way (whether by mortgage, covenant or otherwise) that the Welsh Ministers direct.
(4)
If a person begins development to which paragraph 5 applies in breach of that paragraph, the Welsh Ministers may serve a notice on the person—
(a)
specifying the amount they consider to be recoverable under paragraph 6 in respect of the compensation in question, and
(b)
requiring the person to pay that amount to the Welsh Ministers within a period specified in the notice.
(5)
The period specified in the notice must be at least 3 months beginning with the day after the day on which the notice is served.‍Recovery of compensation from acquiring authority on compulsory acquisition or sale
8
(1)
This paragraph applies where—
(a)
an interest in land is compulsorily acquired or is sold to an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers,
(b)
a compensation notice is registered in respect of any of the land, whether before or after the completion of the acquisition or sale, and
(c)
the compensation specified in the notice is payable in consequence of a change or revocation of an infrastructure consent order that was made before the service of the notice to treat, or the making of the contract, in pursuance of which the acquisition or sale is effected.
(2)
The Welsh Ministers are entitled to recover from the acquiring authority an amount equal to the amount of the compensation specified in the compensation notice that is attributable to the land acquired or sold.
(See paragraph 6(7) for provision about calculating the amount of compensation that is attributable to a part of the land to which a compensation notice relates.).
(3)
If, immediately after the completion of the acquisition or sale, a person other than the acquiring authority continues to have an interest in the land acquired or sold, the amount that is recoverable under this paragraph does not become payable until that interest either ceases to exist or becomes vested in the acquiring authority.
(4)
No amount is recoverable under this paragraph in connection with the acquisition or sale if the Welsh Ministers are satisfied that the interest in question is being acquired for the purposes of the use of the land as an open space.
(5)
A power under any enactment to pay a grant in respect of expenditure incurred by the acquiring authority in connection with the acquisition or sale includes the power to pay a grant in respect of any amount recoverable from the authority under this paragraph.
(6)
In sub-paragraph (1)(a), “authority possessing compulsory purchase powers” means—
(a)
a person who could be or has been authorised to acquire the interest in question compulsorily for the purpose for which the interest is sold, or
(b)
a community council on whose behalf a county council or county borough council could be or has been authorised to acquire the interest for that purpose (see section 125 of the Local Government Act 1972 (c. 70)).
(7)
In a case where a notice to treat is deemed to be served by virtue of an enactment, the reference in sub-paragraph (1)(c) to the service of the notice to treat is to be read as a reference to the date on which the notice is deemed to be served.
(8)

(2)
Where an interest in land is subject to a mortgage—
(a)
any compensation for depreciation that is payable under this Schedule in respect of the interest must be assessed as if the interest were not subject to the mortgage;
(b)
a claim for compensation for depreciation may be made by any mortgagee of the interest, but that does not affect the right of the person whose interest is subject to the mortgage to make a claim;
(c)
no compensation for depreciation is payable in respect of the interest of the mortgagee (as distinct from the interest that is subject to the mortgage);
(d)
any compensation for depreciation that is payable in respect of the interest subject to the mortgage must be paid to the mortgagee or, if there is more than one mortgagee, to the first mortgagee; and it must be applied by the mortgagee to whom it is paid as if it were proceeds of sale.Determination of claims for compensation

(b)
if the case is within section 69(1)(b), the date on which the Ombudsman received the written allegation investigated under section 69(1)(a).
(4)
This subsection applies if the Ombudsman considers that the Ombudsman has, or is likely to have, an interest in the matters which may be investigated or the outcome of any investigation.
(5)
If subsection (4) applies the Ombudsman must disclose the nature of the interest to the person to whom any investigation under section 69 would or does relate, and to any person who has made an allegation as described in section 69(1)(a).
(6)
If the Ombudsman makes a decision as to whether to investigate a case, or investigates a case, in contravention of subsection (1), that contravention does not affect the validity of anything done by the Ombudsman.
69B
Investigation procedure
(1)
If the Ombudsman conducts an investigation under section 69, the Ombudsman must give the person to whom the investigation relates an opportunity to comment on whether that person has failed to comply with the code of conduct of the relevant authority of which that person is or was a member or co-opted member.
(2)
An investigation must be conducted in private.
(3)
Subject to subsections (1) and (2), the procedure for conducting an investigation is that which the Ombudsman thinks appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

sums in respect of the expenses properly incurred by them, and
(b)
allowances to compensate for the loss of their time.
(7)
The Ombudsman may attach conditions to payments under subsection (6).
(8)

(b)
any power or duty of a relevant authority to take further action in respect of any matter under investigation.
69C
Information, documents, evidence and facilities
(1)
The Ombudsman may require a person the Ombudsman thinks is able to supply information or produce a document relevant to an investigation under section 69 to do so.

(a)
the attendance and examination of witnesses (including the administration of oaths and affirmations and the examination of witnesses abroad), and

Subject to subsection (6), no person may be compelled to give any evidence or produce any document which the person could not be compelled to give or produce in civil proceedings before the High Court.
(6)
The Crown is not entitled to any privilege in relation to the production of documents or the giving of evidence that would otherwise be allowed by law in legal proceedings.
(7)
Where an obligation to maintain secrecy or other restriction on the disclosure of information obtained by or supplied to persons in Her Majesty's service has been imposed by an enactment or a rule of law, the obligation or restriction does not apply to the disclosure of information for the purposes of the investigation.
69D
Obstruction and contempt
(1)
If the Ombudsman is satisfied that the condition in subsection (2) is met in relation to a person, the Ombudsman may issue a certificate to that effect to the High Court.
(2)
The condition is that the person—
(a)
without lawful excuse, has obstructed the discharge of any of the Ombudsman's functions under this Part, or
(b)
has done an act in relation to an investigation under section 69 which, if the investigation were proceedings in the High Court, would constitute contempt of court.
(3)
But the condition in subsection (2) is not met in relation to a person merely because that person has taken action such as is mentioned in section 69B(8).
(4)
If the Ombudsman issues a certificate under subsection (1), the High Court may inquire into the matter.
(5)
If the High Court is satisfied that the condition in subsection (2) is met in relation to the person, it may deal with that person in the same manner as it may deal with a person who has committed contempt in relation to the High Court.
69E

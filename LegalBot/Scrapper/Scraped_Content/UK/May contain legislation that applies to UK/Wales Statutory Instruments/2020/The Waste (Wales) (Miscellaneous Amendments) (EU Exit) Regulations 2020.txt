S.I. 2005/1806 (W. 138) amended by S.I. 2009/2861 (W. 250), 2011/971 (W. 141), 2013/755 (W. 90), 2018/721 (W. 140) and 2019/414 (W. 96). There are other amendments not relevant to these Regulations.Lesley Griffiths

23 November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under powers of the Welsh Ministers in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16), in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively, and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
In particular, these regulations make modifications to the Waste (Wales) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/414 (W. 96)) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
The 2019 Regulations, which come into force on IP completion day, make modifications to the Waste (Wales) Measure 2010 (nawm 8), the Landfill Allowances Scheme (Wales) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/1490 (W. 155)), the Hazardous Waste (Wales) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/1806 (W. 138)) and the Recycling, Preparation for Re-use and Composting Targets (Monitoring and Penalties) (Wales) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1014 (W. 152).
As a result of implementation of EU legislation since the 2019 Regulations were made, including amendments to various EU Directives made under the EU Circular Economy Package, the correcting provisions made by the 2019 Regulations no-longer fully address the deficiencies in the operation of retained EU law which will arise as a consequence of leaving the European Union, and which they were intended to correct.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations, which has effect immediately before IP completion day, makes amendments to the 2019 Regulations, in order to ensure that when they come into force, the instruments they amend, will function effectively on IP completion day.
Regulation 3 revokes certain minor provisions in the Hazardous Waste (Wales) Regulations 2005 which will cease to function effectively after IP completion day.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a Regulatory Impact Assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

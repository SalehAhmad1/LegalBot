15 June 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations prescribe various enactments for the purposes of section 57(6) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”).
Under section 57(1) of the 1990 Act, the Welsh Ministers may direct the holder of any environmental permit authorising a waste operation to accept and keep, or accept and treat or dispose of, waste at specified places on specified terms.
Under section 57(2) of the 1990 Act, the Welsh Ministers may direct any person who is keeping waste on land to deliver the waste to a specified person on specified terms, with a view to it being treated or disposed of by that person.
Section 57(6) of the 1990 Act allows enactments to be prescribed by Regulations to ensure that a person shall not be guilty of an offence under such enactments by reason of anything done in order to comply with a Direction under section 57.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of regulatory impact assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment was not carried out as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

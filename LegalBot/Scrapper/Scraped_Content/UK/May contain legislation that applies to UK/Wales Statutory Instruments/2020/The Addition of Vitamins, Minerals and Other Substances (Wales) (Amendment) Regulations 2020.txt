The Welsh Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 16(1)(a) and (f), 17(2), 26(1)(a) and (3) and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990(1) and now vested in them(2) and section 2(2) of, and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(3).
The Welsh Ministers have been designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in relation to measures relating to food (including drink) including the primary production of food(4).These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, and it appears to the Welsh Ministers that it is expedient for certain references to provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2016/128(5) to be construed as references to those provisions as amended from time to time.
The Welsh Ministers have had regard to relevant advice given by the Food Standards Agency in accordance with section 48(4A) of the Food Safety Act 1990(6).
As required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(7), there has been open and transparent public consultation during the preparation and evaluation of these Regulations.

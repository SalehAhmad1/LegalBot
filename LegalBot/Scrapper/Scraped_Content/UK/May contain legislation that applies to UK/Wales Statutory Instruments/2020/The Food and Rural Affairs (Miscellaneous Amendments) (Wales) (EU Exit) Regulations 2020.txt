17 November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraphs 1(1) and 11M(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, to reflect the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the EU withdrawal agreement, and to make transitional provision.
These Regulations make amendments to subordinate legislation, which apply in relation to Wales, relating to food and rural affairs. They amend the Eggs and Chicks (Wales) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1671 (W. 158)), the Food (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/732 (W. 137)), the Retained EU Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1281 (W. 225)) and the Rural Affairs (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Wales) (EU Exit) (No. 3) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1376 (W. 242)) and revoke the Food Information (Wales) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1418 (W. 253)). The Food (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and the Rural Affairs (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Wales) (EU Exit) (No. 3) Regulations 2019 amend a number of statutory instruments in the field of food and rural affairs.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

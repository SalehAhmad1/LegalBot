11 March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016 (“the Act”).
Part 2 contains an amendment to section 9 of the Act. Section 9 of the Act concerns any decision the Welsh Ministers make about whether a service provider, a person applying to be a service provider, a responsible individual or a person to be designated as a responsible individual (hereafter collectively referred to as “a relevant person”) is a fit and proper person to be a service provider or, as the case may be, a responsible individual.
Regulation 3 amends section 9 to extend the application of subsection (6) to include any other person associated or formerly associated with a relevant person.
The effect of this amendment is to allow the Welsh Ministers to take into account evidence that any person associated or formerly associated with a relevant person has been responsible for, contributed to or facilitated misconduct or mismanagement in the provision of a regulated service in Wales or of the equivalent outside Wales.
Part 3 contains amendments to the Regulated Services (Registration) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (“the Registration Regulations”). The Registration Regulations are made under sections 6 and 11 of the Act.
Section 6(1) of the Act sets out the information that must be contained in an application for registration as a service provider of a regulated service and enables the Welsh Ministers to prescribe additional information that must be contained in an application for registration.
Regulation 3 of the Registration Regulations specifies the additional information that is to be provided by an applicant for registration. This includes the information listed in Schedule 1 to the Registration Regulations.
Regulation 5 inserts regulation 3A into the Registration Regulations.
Regulation 3A sets out the additional information that must be provided by, in the case of a body corporate, each director, trustee, or member of the managing committee; in the case of a partnership, each partner; and in the case of an unincorporated body, each person concerned in the management and control of the body.
Regulation 7 contains a transitional provision relevant to the inserted regulation 3A.
Part 4 amends each of the following sets of Regulations (hereafter collectively referred to as “the Regulated Services Regulations”) which are made under sections 27 and 28 of the Act:
(a)
the Regulated Services (Service Providers and Responsible Individuals) (Wales) Regulations 2017,
(b)
the Adult Placement Services (Service Providers and Responsible Individuals) (Wales) Regulations 2019,
(c)
the Regulated Advocacy Services (Service Providers and Responsible Individuals) (Wales) Regulations 2019,
(d)
the Regulated Fostering Services (Service Providers and Responsible Individuals) (Wales) Regulations 2019, and
(e)
the Regulated Adoption Services (Service Providers and Responsible Individuals) (Wales) Regulations 2019.
The Regulated Services Regulations set out the regulatory requirements which apply to providers of services regulated under the Act. These are care home services, secure accommodation services, residential family centre services, domiciliary support services, adult placement services, advocacy services, fostering services and adoption services.
In each set of the Regulated Services Regulations, Schedule 3 lists the events of which the service provider must notify the service regulator, the Welsh Ministers.
Regulation 9 substitutes for paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 to each set of the Regulated Services Regulations, new paragraphs 3 and 3A.
The event listed in new paragraph 3 is any change to the persons who form part of the body constituted (formally or informally) as the decision-making body of the organisation, such as the directors, trustees or members of the managing committee of the service provider where the service provider is a body corporate.
The event listed in new paragraph 3A is any change in the persons who are concerned in the management and control of the body of the service provider where the service provider is an unincorporated body.
Part 5 amends the Regulated Services (Service Providers and Responsible Individuals) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”).
The 2017 Regulations set out the regulatory requirements which apply to providers of care home services, secure accommodation services, residential family centre services and domiciliary support services.
Part 10 of the 2017 Regulations contains specific requirements as to the fitness of individuals working at the service.
Regulation 12 amends regulation 35 of the 2017 Regulations.
Paragraph (a) substitutes paragraph 2(f) of regulation 35 of the 2017 Regulations which provides that where a service provider employs a person, other than as a manager to provide care and support in connection with a care home provided wholly or mainly for children, a secure accommodation service or a domiciliary support service the person must be registered as a social care worker with Social Care Wales within 6 months of commencing their employment.
Paragraph (b) inserts a new paragraph 2(g) of regulation 35 of the 2017 Regulations which provides that where a person is engaged under a contract for services (which includes agency workers), other than as manager, to provide care and support to any person in connection with a care home service provided wholly or mainly for children, a secure accommodation service or a domiciliary support service that person must be registered with Social Care Wales within 6 months of the date the person is first engaged under a contract for services to provide such care and support.
Paragraph (d) inserts a new paragraph 11 to provide that the requirement that a person is registered with Social Care Wales in accordance with regulation 35(2)(f) and (g), does not apply where that person is employed or engaged under a contract for services to work as a nurse, or registered professional who is registered with the Health and Care Professions Council.

9 November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred on the Welsh Ministers by paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
They are also made in exercise of the powers in section 132 of the Education Act 2002 (c. 32).
These Regulations make technical amendments to the Teachers’ Qualifications (Amendment) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/444 (W. 107)). These technical amendments arise as a result of amendments which are made to the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/312) by the Professional Qualifications and Services (Amendments and Miscellaneous Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1038).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

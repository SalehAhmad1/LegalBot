(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (the “International Travel Regulations”). The International Travel Regulations have been previously amended by:
the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health Information for Persons Travelling to Wales etc.) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/595 (W. 136));
the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Public Health Information to Travellers) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/714 (W. 160));
the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/726 (W. 163)).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after being abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales to isolate for a period of 14 days.
The requirements imposed by the International Travel Regulations are subject to exceptions, and certain categories of person are exempt from having to comply. Persons entering Wales after being in one or more of the countries and territories listed in Schedule 3 to the International Travel Regulations are not required to isolate. The countries and territories listed in Schedule 3 are referred to as “exempt countries and territories”.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the International Travel Regulations to remove Spain from the list of exempt countries and territories.
Regulation 3 makes transitional provision. This relates to a person who had last been in Spain within the 14 days prior to their arrival in Wales and before the amendment made by regulation 2 came into force. If that person leaves Spain shortly before the amendment comes into force and arrives in Wales afterwards they are be treated (for the purposes of regulation 7(1)(b) and 8(1) of the International Travel Regulations) as having been in a non-exempt country or territory. Similarly if that person leaves Spain at any time within the 14 days before the amendment comes into force and arrives in Wales from another place that is exempt (or from elsewhere in the UK) after the amendment comes in to force, the person is also to be treated as having been in a non-exempt country or territory.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely cost and benefit of complying with these Regulations.

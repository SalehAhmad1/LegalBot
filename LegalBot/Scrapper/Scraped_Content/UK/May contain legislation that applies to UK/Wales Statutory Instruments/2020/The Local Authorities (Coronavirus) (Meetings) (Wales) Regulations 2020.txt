[F1(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in relation to local authority meetings, and the publication of and access to certain local authority documents.
Part 1 sets out preliminary matters and defines terms used in these Regulations, including the definition of “local authority” for the purposes of these Regulations. Regulation 3 makes provision about the interaction of these Regulations with standing orders, executive arrangements and any other rules of a local authority. Regulation 4 makes provision about how an authority with its own website must comply with requirements in these Regulations to publish notices or documents electronically.
Part 2 makes provision to enable meetings of local authorities held before 1 May 2021 to be held by means of remote attendance.
Part 3 makes provision about requirements relating to local authority meetings. Regulations 6 to 8 make provision about when annual meetings of principal councils, community councils and National Park authorities may be held in 2020. Regulation 9 makes provision ensuring a local authority is not restricted in determining when meetings (other than the annual meetings addressed by regulations 6 to 8) may be held before 1 May 2021. Regulation 10 makes provision about failures to attend meetings. Regulations 11 to 13 make provision about elections of chairs, vice-chairs and deputy chairs (as the case may be) at the 2020 annual meetings of principal councils, community councils, National Park authorities and the Swansea Bay Port Health Authority. Regulation 14 makes provision in relation to other appointments which are made at local authority meetings held before 1 May 2021.

Regulation 20 modifies provisions of the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960 (c. 67) and regulation 21 modifies provisions of Part 5A of the Local Government Act 1972 (c. 70). Those provisions relate to public access to meetings and to notices and documents relating to meetings.

The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.]

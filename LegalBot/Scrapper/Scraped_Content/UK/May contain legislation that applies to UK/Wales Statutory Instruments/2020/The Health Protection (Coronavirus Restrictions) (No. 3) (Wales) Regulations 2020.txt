These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wales.
The Welsh Ministers consider that restrictions and requirements imposed by these Regulations are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with section 45R of that Act the Welsh Ministers are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, Senedd Cymru.

Interpretation
52.—(1) For the purposes of this Schedule, a “holiday site” means any land in Wales on which a mobile home or caravan is stationed for the purposes of human habitation (including any land in Wales used in conjunction with that land), in respect of which the relevant planning permission or the site licence for the land—
(a)
is expressed to be granted for holiday use only, or
(b)
requires that there are times of the year when no mobile home or caravan may be stationed on the site for human habitation.
(2) For the purpose of determining whether or not a site is a holiday site, any provision of the relevant planning permission or of the site licence which permits the stationing of a mobile home on the land for human habitation all year round is to be ignored if the mobile home is authorised to be occupied by—
(a)
the person who is the owner of the site, or
(b)
a person employed by that person but who does not occupy the mobile home under an agreement to which Part 4 of the Mobile Homes (Wales) Act 2013 M2 applies.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2A of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 enables the Welsh Ministers, by regulations, to make provision for the purpose of preventing, protecting against, controlling or providing a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection or contamination in Wales.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wales. The Regulations impose requirements and restrictions on individuals, businesses and others.
There are 7 Parts to the Regulations.
Part 1 provides that these Regulations come into force at 6 p.m. on 23 October 2020 and expire at the end of the day on 8 November 2020.
Part 2 imposes limits on movement and travel. Regulation 3 requires people living in Wales to stay at home, unless they have a reasonable excuse not to. In addition, in the limited circumstances where people can leave home, there is a restriction in regulation 4 on people gathering with anyone who is not part of their household. The overall effect of these provisions is to restrict movement of people within Wales. Consistent with that, regulation 5 provides that people who live outside Wales need a reasonable excuse to travel into Wales. Regulations 6 and 7 limit the circumstances in which a pupil or student has a reasonable excuse to attend the premises of a school or further education institution. Regulation 9 makes further provision making it an offence (punished by a higher penalty) for organising large scale music events that encourage people to gather illegally.
Part 3 relates to business and services whose premises are ordinarily open to the public, requiring many to close. Part 1 of Schedule 1 lists those businesses and services whose premises must be closed to the public (though regulation 11 makes clear that this does not prevent certain activities from taking place on the premises). Part 2 of Schedule 1 lists businesses and premises whose premises must be closed but to which access may be allowed on a limited basis. These are categorised as premises selling food and drink (which are listed in Chapter 1 and to which limited access is allowed in accordance with regulation 12); premises offering hotel or holiday accommodation (which are listed in Chapter 2 and to which limited access is allowed in accordance with regulation 13); and others (which are listed in Chapter 3 and to which limited access is allowed in accordance with regulation 14). Regulation 15 provides for an exception to the requirement to close which applies to the premises of businesses or services listed in Part 3 of Schedule 1. Regulation 16 makes clear that where more than one type of business or service is provided at the same premises, those prohibited by regulation 11 (and listed in Part 1 of Schedule 1) may not continue.
Part 4 makes provisions for the purpose of minimising risk of exposure to coronavirus. Regulation 17 applies to “regulated premises” (any place which is open to the public or where work is carried out) and requires: (1) all reasonable measures to be taken to ensure that a distance of 2 metres is maintained between persons on the premises; (2) any other reasonable measures to be taken, for example to limit close face to face interaction and maintain hygiene; and (3) information to be provided to those entering or working at premises about how to minimise risk of exposure to coronavirus. It also specifies that not carrying out an activity, closing part of a premises, allowing staff to isolate and collecting contact information from those on the premises may be reasonable measures. Regulations 18 and 19 provide that face coverings must be worn on public transport, including taxis, and in certain indoor places, subject to listed exemptions and exceptions. Regulation 20 provides for guidance to be issued about the practical application of the requirements imposed by this Part, and those to whom the requirements apply must have regard to that guidance.
Part 5 relates to the enforcement of the restrictions and requirements. Regulation 21 makes provision about those who can take enforcement action, regulation 22 makes further provision (in Schedules 2 and 3) about enforcing the need to take preventative measures under regulation 17, regulation 23 relates to compliance notices, and regulation 24 to powers of removal and dispersal. Regulation 25 relates specifically to enforcing the requirement to wear a face covering and regulation 26 to children. Regulation 27 contains a power to enter premises and regulation 28 allows reasonable force to be used in certain circumstances.
Part 6 makes provision about offences and penalties. Regulation 29 provides that a person who, without a reasonable excuse, contravenes (listed) requirements in these Regulations commits an offence. That offence is punishable by an unlimited fine. Regulation 30 relates to offences by bodies corporate. Regulation 31 allows for offences to be punished by way of fixed penalty notices and regulation 32 relates to prosecutions of offences under the regulations.
Part 7 contains defined terms (regulation 33) and revokes the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (Wales) (No.2) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/725 (W. 162)) as they were amended (regulation 34). Regulation 33 also makes provision which modifies the numerous restrictions on individuals in the Regulations which limit interaction with anyone who is not a member of their household. This allows a person who lives alone or only with children to agree to form an extended household with another household, which means that members of both households can interact with each other as if they were members of one household.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely cost and benefit of complying with these Regulations.

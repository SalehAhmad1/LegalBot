20 November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Government of Maintained Schools (Wales) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/2914 (W. 211)).
These Regulations provide that meetings of governing bodies and of governing body committees may be held by remote access if the requisite conditions are met.
They remove the requirement for the clerk, or a person acting as clerk to a governing body or a governing body committee, to enter minutes of proceedings in a book or pages kept for that purpose.
They also remove the requirement for the clerk to record the names of those members of the governing body or the committee and of any other person present at the meeting concerned in the book or pages used for that purpose.
These Regulations enable governing bodies and committees to keep the minutes and agenda in electronic form and for the minutes to be signed electronically.
These Regulations remove the provision disqualifying a person from holding or continuing in office as a governor when he or she is liable to be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely cost and benefit of complying with these Regulations.

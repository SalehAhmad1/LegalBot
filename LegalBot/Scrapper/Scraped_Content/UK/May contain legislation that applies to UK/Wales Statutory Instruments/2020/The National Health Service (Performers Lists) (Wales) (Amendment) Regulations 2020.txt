3 November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Performers Lists) (Wales) Regulations 2004 (“the principal Regulations”), specifically Part 4 of the principal Regulations relating to dental performers lists, to reflect the change to the employment position of foundation dentists.
The principal Regulations currently require that for the purposes of undertaking foundation training, a foundation dentist must be employed under a contract for services with an approved trainer, which for the purposes of the principal Regulations is a dentist.
From 1 September 2020, foundation dentists no longer hold a contract of employment with an approved trainer. Their contract of employment will instead be with Velindre University NHS Trust under the direction of the NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership committee who will act as a single lead employer for all foundation dentists in Wales.
These Regulations amend the principal Regulations to align the applicable legislative provisions with the change to policy.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 28 (interpretation) of the principal Regulations. It amends the definitions of “approved trainer” and “foundation training” to reflect the move to Velindre University NHS Trust under the direction of the NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership committee as single lead employer for foundation dentists. Definitions of “HEIW”, “NWSSP committee” and “Velindre University NHS Trust” are also inserted into regulation 28 of the principal Regulations.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 30 of the principal Regulations so that it requires foundation dentists, as part of the undertakings the foundation dentist is required to give in regulation 30(2), not to perform any primary dental services except when acting in accordance with their contract of employment with Velindre University NHS Trust.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

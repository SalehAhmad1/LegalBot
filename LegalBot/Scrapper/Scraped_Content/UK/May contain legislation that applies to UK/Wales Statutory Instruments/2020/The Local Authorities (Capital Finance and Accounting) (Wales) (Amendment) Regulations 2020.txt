31 January 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Local Authorities (Capital Finance and Accounting) (Wales) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”).
These Regulations insert a new regulation 24K into the 2003 Regulations. New regulation 24K provides that a local authority must not charge an amount to its revenue account to reflect any fluctuation in the fair value of a local authority’s investment in a pooled investment fund. Instead, such amounts must be recorded in a separate account established and used solely for that purpose.
The fair value of a local authority investment in a pooled investment fund is determined in accordance with proper accounting practices as defined in regulation 25 of the 2003 Regulations. This accounting treatment is not to apply to the recognition of an impairment loss to such an investment as recognised under those proper accounting practices, or to any disposal (including a sale) of such an investment. It is also not applicable to investments made by a local authority in its capacity as the administering authority of a local government pension fund.
Regulation 24K will apply to accounts prepared for financial years in respect of the period beginning with 1 April 2019 and ending with 31 March 2023.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced as no impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

21 January 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Education (School Day and School Year) (Wales) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”) apply to schools maintained by local authorities and to special schools whether or not so maintained. They make provision, among other things, for a school day which is ordinarily to be divided into two sessions with a break in the middle, and for schools (other than nursery schools) to meet for at least 380 sessions during any school year.
These Regulations amend the 2003 Regulations to reduce the minimum number of school sessions which must be held in the 2021–2022 school year from 380 to 378. The reduction in the minimum number of school sessions is to ensure schools benefit from the additional bank holiday taking place during the half term holiday on 3 June 2022 to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen.
These Regulations also revoke the Education (School Day and School Year) (Wales) (Amendment) (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 which made amendments to the 2003 Regulations in relation to the 2020-2021 school year.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

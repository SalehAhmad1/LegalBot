(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations prescribe the form of certain notices and other documents required or authorised to be given or made by or because of the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 1).
Regulation 3(1) introduces the regulations and Schedule which set out the form of the notices and other documents prescribed by these Regulations. Regulation 3(2) provides that a notice or other document which is in a form substantially to the same effect is valid.
Regulations 4 to 41 prescribe the form of each specified notice or other document.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

https://www.aocs.org/crm.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Welsh Ministers make these Regulations pursuant to retained Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed (“Regulation 1829/2003”). These Regulations authorise the placing on the market of nine food and feed products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified organisms.
Regulation 3 and Schedules 1 to 9 provide for the authorisation of the nine products—
Schedule 1 renews the authorisation for genetically modified maize MIR604;
Schedule 2 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MZIR098;
Schedule 3 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 87427 × MON 89034 × MIR162 × NK603 and its sub-combinations;
Schedule 4 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 87427 × MON 89034 × MIR162 × MON 87411 and the sub-combinations that are not covered by Schedule 3;
Schedule 5 is a new authorisation for genetically modified soybean MON 87751 × MON 87701 × MON 87708 × MON 89788 and its sub-combinations;
Schedule 6 renews the authorisation for genetically modified maize Bt11;
Schedule 7 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 87427 × MON 87460 × MON 89034 × MIR162 × NK603 and the sub-combinations that are not covered by Schedule 3;
Schedule 8 renews the authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 88017;
Schedule 9 renews the authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 89034.
Authorisations granted by these Regulations are valid for a period of ten years in accordance with Articles 7(4) and 19(4) of Regulation 1829/2003. This is subject to Articles 11(4) and 23(4) of that Regulation, which provide for an extension of the authorisation period in certain circumstances where an application for renewal has been submitted.
Paragraphs (a) to (d) of regulation 4 revoke, in relation to Wales, retained EU Decisions that contain the previous authorisations (which have expired) for the products now authorised by Schedules 1, 6, 8 and 9.
Paragraph (e) of regulation 4 revokes, in relation to Wales, retained Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1111, which contains the existing authorisation for four of the sub-combinations of the product now authorised by Schedule 3. The existing authorisation has been consolidated within Schedule 3.
In each Schedule, paragraph 4 specifies the method, for detection, including sampling, which has been validated for use in relation to the authorised products. The documents referred to have been published at http://gmo-crl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/statusofdossiers.aspx.
All relevant information on the authorisation of the products will be entered in the register of genetically modified food and feed referred to in Article 28(1) of Regulation 1829/2003.
The authorisations made by this instrument will be notified through the Biosafety Clearing-House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Articles 9(1) and 15(1)(e) of retained Regulation (EC) No. 1946/2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms.
Further information, including in relation to the register or the information notified pursuant to the Cartagena Protocol, can be obtained from the Food Standards Agency, 11th Floor, Southgate House, Cardiff, CF10 1EW or by writing to regulated.products.wales@food.gov.uk.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

At 4.04 p.m. on 5 July 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Building (Approved Inspectors etc.) Regulations 2010 (“the Approved Inspectors Regulations”). The amendments made by these Regulations are consequential on section 48 of the Building Safety Act 2022. That section makes repeals to the Building Act 1984 in respect of insurance requirements for approved inspectors.
Regulation 2(2) omits regulation 5A (approved inspector’s insurance) from the Approved Inspectors Regulations, removing the requirement for a declaration of insurance to be in the possession of the person who approved the inspector. Regulations 2(3) and (4) make consequential amendments to regulations 7 and 9 respectively. Regulation 2(5) amends the forms in Schedule 1 to the Approved Inspectors Regulations so the forms no longer refer to the declaration of insurance. Regulation 2(6) to (8) amends Schedules 2, 3 and 4 to the Approved Inspectors Regulations to remove from each of the Schedules the ground of rejection relating to the declaration of insurance.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

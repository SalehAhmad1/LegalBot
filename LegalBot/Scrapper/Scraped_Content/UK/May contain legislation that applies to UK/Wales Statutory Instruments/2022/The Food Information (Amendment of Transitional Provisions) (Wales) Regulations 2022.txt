Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Wellbeing, one of the Welsh MinistersEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend statutory instruments and retained EU law in relation to food labelling in Wales. The amendments extend previous transitional arrangements, which were due to expire at the end of September 2022, so that they continue to apply until the end of 2023.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

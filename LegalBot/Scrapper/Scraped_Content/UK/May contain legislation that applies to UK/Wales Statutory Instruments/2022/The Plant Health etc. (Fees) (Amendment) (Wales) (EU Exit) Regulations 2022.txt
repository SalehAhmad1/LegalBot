17 February 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 4 and paragraphs 12 and 21(b) of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) and amend the Plant Health etc. (Fees) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1179) (W. 238) (“the 2018 Regulations”).
They make modifications to the 2018 Regulations, in consequence of amendments made by the Official Controls (Extension of Transitional Periods) (England and Wales) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/1443). The amendments in those Regulations extended “the transitional staging period” (defined in Annex 6 to Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (EUR 2017/625)).
Regulation 2 amends the 2018 Regulations to align the timing of the imposition of certain fees in Wales with the extended transitional staging period.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

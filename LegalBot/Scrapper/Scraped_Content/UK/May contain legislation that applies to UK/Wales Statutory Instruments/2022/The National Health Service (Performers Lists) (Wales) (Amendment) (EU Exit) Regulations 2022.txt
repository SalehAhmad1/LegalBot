(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Performers Lists) (Wales) Regulations 2004 (“the principal Regulations”). Regulation 2 amends regulation 31 of the principal Regulations in the consequence of the repeal of section 15(1)(b) of the Dentists Act 1984. These Regulations ensure dentists holding an appropriate European diploma remain exempt from the requirement to undertake foundation training before being eligible for inclusion on a Dental Performers List.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

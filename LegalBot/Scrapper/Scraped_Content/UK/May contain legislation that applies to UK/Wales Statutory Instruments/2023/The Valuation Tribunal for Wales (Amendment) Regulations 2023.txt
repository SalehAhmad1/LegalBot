10 July 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Valuation Tribunal for Wales Regulations 2010 (“the 2010 Regulations”).
Regulations 3, 4 and 12 amend provisions relating to the Governing Council. The amendments reduce the quorum for meetings of the Governing Council to three, and allow Welsh Minister appointed members to sit on an Appointments Panel when it is appointing Chairpersons and those who are not Chairpersons to be elected as national representatives.
Regulation 5 removes the maximum 10-year period of membership. Regulation 6 enables the Appointments Panel to appoint members for periods not exceeding five years and clarifies that membership will not cease at the end of a period of appointment when it is followed immediately by a further period of membership.
Regulations 7 to 11 amend administrative arrangements for Council Tax Appeals. The amendments confirm that a hearing includes one which takes place either in whole or part by electronic two-way communication, specify that the Valuation Tribunal may regulate its own procedure, and update requirements for displaying of notices.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision as regards the provisional authorisation, in relation to Wales, of certain feed additives under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on additives for use in animal nutrition.
Regulation 3, and Schedules 1 to 4, prescribe the forms of the provisional authorisations, in relation to Wales, of four feed additives.
Schedule 1 contains the prescribed form of provisional authorisation for cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate (identification number 3b301).
Schedule 2 contains the prescribed form of provisional authorisation for cobalt(II) carbonate (identification number 3b302).
Schedule 3 contains the prescribed form of provisional authorisation for cobalt(II) carbonate hydroxide (2:3) monohydrate (identification number 3b303).
Schedule 4 contains the prescribed form of provisional authorisation for cobalt(II) sulphate heptahydrate (identification number 3b305).
Further information, including in relation to any documentation referenced in the Schedules, can be obtained from the Food Standards Agency, 11th Floor, Southgate House, Wood Street, Cardiff, CF10 1EW or by writing to regulated.products.wales@food.gov.uk.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

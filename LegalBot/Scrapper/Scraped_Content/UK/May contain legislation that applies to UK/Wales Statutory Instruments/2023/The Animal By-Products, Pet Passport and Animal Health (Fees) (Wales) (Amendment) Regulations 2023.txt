The Welsh Ministers make these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 4 and paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018(1) (“the 2018 Act”) and section 10(1) and (3)(c) of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 1984(2).
In accordance with paragraph 1(8) of Schedule 7 to the 2018 Act, a draft of these Regulations has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, Senedd Cymru(3).
(1)
2018 c. 16; see paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 for the meaning of “appropriate authority”. Paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 to the 2018 Act was amended by section 41(4) of, and paragraph 47(5) of Schedule 5 to, the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1) (“the 2020 Act”). Paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 was amended by section 41(4) of, and paragraphs 38 and 53(2) of Schedule 5 to, the 2020 Act.
(2)
1984 c. 40. Section 10 was amended by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1993 (c. 50) and the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44). Section 10(8) defines the “appropriate Minister” as meaning the Secretary of State in relation to Wales for the purposes of section 10. The functions of the Secretary of State, insofar as they are exercisable in relation to Wales, were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales by article 2 of the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672). Those functions are now exercisable by the Welsh Ministers by virtue of section 162 of, and paragraph 30 of Schedule 11 to, the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32).
(3)
Paragraph 1(8) of Schedule 7 applies to regulations under Schedule 4 by virtue of paragraph 12(3) of Schedule 7 to the 2018 Act.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under powers given to the Welsh Ministers by the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 (“the 2014 Act”). The 2014 Act makes provision in relation to annual reports by local authorities about the exercise of their social services functions.
The Local Authority Social Services Annual Reports (Prescribed Form) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”) make provision in relation to the form of those reports. These Regulations amend the 2017 Regulations to set out revised requirements as to the form of annual reports.
Regulation 3 amends the information that must be included in the annual report and headings under which the information that is required must be included.
Regulation 4 makes transitional arrangements in respect of these amendments.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

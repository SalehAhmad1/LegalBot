9 March 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Care and Support (Population Assessments) (Wales) Regulations 2015 (“the principal Regulations”), which make provision for the carrying out of population assessments.
Regulation 4 of the principal Regulations provides that, in carrying out a population assessment, responsible bodies must engage with certain private sector or third sector organisations. Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends regulation 4 of the principal Regulations so that responsible bodies must also engage with any public body which they believe is concerned with or has an interest in the provision of care and support or preventative services to the local population. Regulation 2 of these Regulations also inserts relevant definitions for these purposes.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under section 28 of the Health and Social Care (Quality and Engagement) (Wales) Act 2020 (asc 1) (“the 2020 Act”).
The 2020 Act established the Citizen Voice Body for Health and Social Care, Wales (“the Body”). The Body’s general objective, in exercising its functions, is to represent the interests of the public in respect of health and social services. The 2020 Act also provides for the abolition of the Community Health Councils.
These Regulations make consequential, supplementary and incidental amendments to, and provide for the revocation of, secondary legislation to reflect the establishment of the Body and the commencement of its substantive functions, and the abolition of the Community Health Councils, provided for in the 2020 Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

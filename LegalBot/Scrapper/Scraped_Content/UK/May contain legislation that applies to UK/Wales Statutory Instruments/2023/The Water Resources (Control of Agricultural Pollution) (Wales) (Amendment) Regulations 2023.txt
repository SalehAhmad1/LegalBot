25 April 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Water Resources (Control of Agricultural Pollution) (Wales) Regulations 2021 (“the 2021 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 2 of the 2021 Regulations to change the implementation date for regulations 4 and 36 of the 2021 Regulations from 30 April 2023 to 31 October 2023 for holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within a nitrate vulnerable zone (“NVZ”).
Regulation 2(3) amends regulation 4 of the 2021 Regulations so the 170kg per hectare maximum limit of nitrogen in livestock manure applies to each 12 month period beginning with 31 October for holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within an NVZ.
Regulation 2(4)(a) amends the definition of “previous 12 month period” in regulation 36(6) of the 2021 Regulations so the relevant record keeping period reflects the 12 month period beginning 31 October under regulation 4 for holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within an NVZ. It also makes clear that the first relevant record keeping period for occupiers of holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within an NVZ is 31 October 2023 to 30 October 2024.
Regulation 2(4)(b) amends the definition of “relevant date” in regulation 36(6) of the 2021 Regulations so that the occupiers of holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within an NVZ must make a record of the relevant data required under regulation 36(1) before 28 February 2025 and 28 February for all years subsequently.

(This note is not part of the Order)
The blight notice provisions in sections 149 to 171 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (“the Act”) enable persons holding certain interests in categories of land (including land affected by certain planning and highway proposals) to require the appropriate authority to acquire their interest in the land. The categories of land are specified in Schedule 13 to the Act.
One of the interests in land in Wales which qualifies for protection is an interest of an owner-occupier of a hereditament where the annual value of the hereditament does not exceed such amount as may be prescribed by the Welsh Ministers. “Hereditament” means a relevant hereditament within the meaning of section 64(4)(a) to (c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988.
This Order increases the annual value limit from £34,800 to £36,000 in relation to Wales.
The Town and Country Planning (Blight Provisions) (Wales) Order 2011 is revoked.
An impact assessment has been prepared in relation to this Order. Copies are available from the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

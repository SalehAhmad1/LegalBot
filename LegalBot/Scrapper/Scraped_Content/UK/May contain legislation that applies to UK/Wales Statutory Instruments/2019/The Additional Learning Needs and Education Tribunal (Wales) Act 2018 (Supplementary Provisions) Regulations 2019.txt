The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”) establishes the statutory system in Wales for meeting the additional learning needs of children and young people. Part 3 of the 2018 Act continues the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales and re-names it the Education Tribunal for Wales.
These Regulations make amendments to section 91 of the 2018 Act which provides for the constitution of the Education Tribunal, including the appointment of the President of the Tribunal and other members of the Education Tribunal.
Regulation 2(2) removes from section 91(3) of the 2018 Act the requirement for the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice for the appointment of the President of the Education Tribunal by the Lord Chancellor.
Regulation 2(3) removes from section 91(4) of the 2018 Act the requirement for the agreement of the President of the Tribunal for the appointment of the legal chair panel by the Lord Chancellor.
Regulation 3 substitutes for the entry in Schedule 14 to the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 relating to the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales an entry relating to the Education Tribunal.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in the light of these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

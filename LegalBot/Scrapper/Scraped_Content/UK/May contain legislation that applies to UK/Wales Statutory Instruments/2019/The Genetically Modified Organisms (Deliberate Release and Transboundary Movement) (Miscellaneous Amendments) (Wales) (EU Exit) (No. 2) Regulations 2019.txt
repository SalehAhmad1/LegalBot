4 December 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations revoke and remake with amendments Part 3 of the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release and Transboundary Movement) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/379 (W. 94)) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
These Regulations make amendments to subordinate legislation, which applies in relation to Wales, relating to the control and regulation of the deliberate release, placing on the market, and transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms.
Regulations 2 and 3 of these Regulations make various amendments to Welsh subordinate legislation in order to correct failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from withdrawal from the European Union.
Regulation 4 revokes various provisions including Part 3 of the 2019 Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a Regulatory Impact Assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

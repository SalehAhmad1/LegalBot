Coming into force

The Welsh Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred on them by section 2(2) of, and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(1).
The Welsh Ministers have been designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in relation to measures in respect of food (including drink) including the primary production of food(2).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Welsh Ministers that it is expedient for any reference in the Fishery Product (Official Controls Charges) (Wales) Regulations 2007(3) to an EU instrument defined in the Schedule to those Regulations, as those Regulations are amended by these Regulations, to be construed as a reference to that instrument as amended from time to time.
As required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(4) there has been open and transparent public consultation during the preparation of these Regulations.

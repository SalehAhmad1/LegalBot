11 June 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Electricity (Offshore Generating Stations) (Applications for Consent) (Wales) Regulations 2019 (“the Applications for Consent Regulations”), the Electricity (Offshore Generating Stations) (Inquiries Procedure) (Wales) Regulations 2019 (“the Inquiries Procedure Regulations”) and the Electricity (Offshore Generating Stations) (Variation of Consents) (Wales) Regulations 2019 (“the Variation of Consents Regulations”).
Regulations 2 and 3 amend the Applications for Consent Regulations and the Variation of Consents Regulations respectively. They replace references to “the Department of the Environment” in Northern Ireland to “a district council” to reflect changes made by the Planning (Northern Ireland) Act 2011 which transferred the majority of planning functions and decision making responsibilities to district councils. They also replace the term “national newspapers” with “newspapers circulating in Wales, England and Northern Ireland”.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 16 of the Inquiries Procedure Regulations to define “by local advertisement” and to prescribe when first publication of the notice of the inquiry required by regulation 16(1) must be made. Other minor amendments are made to regulation 16.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of regulatory impact assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

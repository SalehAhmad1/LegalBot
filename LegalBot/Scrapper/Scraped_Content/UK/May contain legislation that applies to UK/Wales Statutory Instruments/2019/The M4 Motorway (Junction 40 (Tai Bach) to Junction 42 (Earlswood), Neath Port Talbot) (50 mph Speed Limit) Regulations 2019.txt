(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Welsh Ministers make these Regulations which impose a maximum speed limit of 50 miles per hour (instead of the general 70 miles per hour speed limit imposed on motorways by the Motorways Traffic (Speed Limit) Regulations 1974 (S.I. 1974/502)) on the lengths of the M4 motorway specified in the Schedule to these Regulations.
The M4 Motorway (Port Talbot, Neath Port Talbot) (50 Mph Speed Limit) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/2179) (W. 208) are revoked by these Regulations. The M4 Motorway (Junction 41 (Pentyla) to Junction 42 (Earlswood), Neath Port Talbot) (Temporary 50 mph Speed Limit) Order 2018 (S.I. 2018/746) (W. 144) which is in place at the above location will be revoked in a separate revocation order.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as these Regulations maintain the current 50 miles per hour limit for road safety reasons and extend the affected length to reduce vehicle emissions and improve air quality. These Regulations have no impact on the costs of business.

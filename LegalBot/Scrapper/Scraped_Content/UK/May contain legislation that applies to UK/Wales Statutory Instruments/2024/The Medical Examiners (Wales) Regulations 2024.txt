12 April 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in respect of medical examiners appointed by a Welsh NHS body to discharge the functions conferred on medical examiners by or under Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (c. 25) (“the Act”). Those functions include functions relating to the medical certification of the cause of deaths which are required to be registered under Part 2 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 (c. 20).
Regulation 3 sets out provisions about mandatory terms to be included in the terms of appointment of medical examiners and about termination of appointment, and permits the inclusion of such other terms as may be agreed between the appointing body and medical examiner (as defined in regulation 2 of these Regulations).
Regulation 4 makes provision permitting an appointing body to pay remuneration, expenses, fees, compensation for termination of appointment, pensions, allowances or gratuities to medical examiners.
Regulation 5 makes provision in relation to the training to be undertaken by medical examiners.
Regulation 6 requires medical examiners to follow certain steps where, in relation to a death which is required to be registered, the medical examiner is insufficiently independent within the meaning of that regulation, because of a connection the medical examiner had with the deceased person, the relevant attending practitioner or any other relevant medical practitioner at the time of the death. These steps include declining to exercise functions in relation to a death and notifying their appointing body.
Regulation 7 confers functions on medical examiners which are in addition to their functions relating to the medical certificate of cause of death under regulations made under section 20(1) of the Act.
Regulation 8 provides that the supply of any information under these Regulations does not breach any obligation of confidence. It also provides that these Regulations do not operate to require or authorise the disclosure or use of information which would contravene the data protection legislation.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

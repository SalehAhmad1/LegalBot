17 July 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under section 146 of the Tertiary Education and Research (Wales) Act 2022 (“the 2022 Act”) which enables the Welsh Ministers to make provision for the purposes of, in consequence of, or for giving full effect to any provision of the 2022 Act.
The 2022 Act establishes the Commission for Tertiary Education and Research, abolishes the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and makes provision in relation to the regulation and funding of tertiary education and research in Wales.
These Regulations make consequential amendments to primary and secondary legislation to reflect the provisions in the 2022 Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

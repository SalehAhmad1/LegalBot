13 February 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend—
(a)
the Higher Education (Amounts) (Wales) Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”),
(b)
the Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”), and
(c)
the Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (“the 2018 Regulations”).
The 2015 Regulations prescribe the maximum amount that an institution with a fee and access plan is able to charge by way of tuition fees for full-time undergraduate courses. The 2015 Regulations also prescribe lower maximum amounts in respect of certain courses.
Regulations 3 to 6 amend the 2015 Regulations to increase each prescribed maximum amount in respect of academic years beginning on or after 1 August 2024.
The 2017 Regulations provide for financial support for eligible students taking designated higher education courses which begin before 1 August 2018.
The 2018 Regulations provide for financial support for eligible students taking designated higher education courses which begin on or after 1 August 2018.
Regulation 7 makes corrections to the 2017 Regulations.
Regulation 8 amends the 2018 Regulations to increase the maximum amount of tuition fee loan available to certain categories of students undertaking courses at ordinary providers in Wales in respect of academic years beginning on or after 1 August 2024. The increase in support corresponds to the increase in the prescribed maximum amount of fee under the 2015 Regulations, as a result of the amendments made by regulations 3 to 6.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

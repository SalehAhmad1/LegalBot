(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (the “International Travel Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales to isolate for a period determined in accordance with those Regulations.
These Regulations amend Schedule 3A to the International Travel Regulations, which contains the list of countries and territories subject to additional measures. Non-exempt persons are prohibited from entering Wales where they have been in a country or territory listed in Schedule 3A within the last 10 days of arrival, pursuant to regulation 12E of the International Travel Regulations. Regulation 2 adds Maldives, Nepal and Turkey to the list in Schedule 3A.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

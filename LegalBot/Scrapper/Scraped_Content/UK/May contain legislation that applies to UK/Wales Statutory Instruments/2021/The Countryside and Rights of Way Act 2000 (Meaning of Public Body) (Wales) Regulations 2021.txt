At 9.45 a.m. on 1 December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend section 85 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (c. 37). Section 85(1) provides that when exercising or performing any function in relation to, or affecting, an area of outstanding natural beauty a “relevant authority” shall have regard to the purposes of conserving and enhancing the natural beauty of the area.
Section 85(2) lists the bodies and persons who are a “relevant authority” and who are therefore subject to the duty contained in section 85(1). The list includes “any public body”, with section 85(3) listing bodies that are included within this term.
These Regulations amend section 85(3) so that corporate joint committees, established by regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (asc 1) (“the Act”), are included in the list of public bodies in section 85(3). This results in corporate joint committees being subject to the duty in section 85(1).
These Regulations are connected with regulations which established certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected orders and regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

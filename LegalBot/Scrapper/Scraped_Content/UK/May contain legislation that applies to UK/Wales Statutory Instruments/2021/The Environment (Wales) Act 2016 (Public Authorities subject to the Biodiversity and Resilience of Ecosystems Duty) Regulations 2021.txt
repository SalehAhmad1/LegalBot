(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend section 6 of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 3) to include corporate joint committees within the definition of “public authority” in subsection (9) of that section, so that corporate joint committees are subject to the biodiversity and resilience of ecosystems duty (“the biodiversity duty”). As a result of these Regulations, corporate joint committees will be required to consider the Nature Recovery Action Plan for Wales when making decisions.
Corporate joint committees are bodies established by regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (asc 1) (“the Act”).
These Regulations are connected with regulations which established certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Act. The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected orders and regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

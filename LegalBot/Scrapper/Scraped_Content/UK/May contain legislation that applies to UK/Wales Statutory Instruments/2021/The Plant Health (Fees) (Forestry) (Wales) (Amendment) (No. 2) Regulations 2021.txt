13 July 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) and amend the Plant Health (Fees) (Forestry) (Wales) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/497 (W. 114)).
These Regulations provide for increases in the fees for services in relation to plant passport authorities and applications for phytosanitary certificates (including phytosanitary certificates for re-export) to reflect an inflationary rise in the cost of providing those services since the introduction of those fees. The fees relating to plant passport authorities have increased by 34% for the period between 2006 and 2020, while fees for export certification have increased by 40% for the period between 2004 and 2020 (based on the Consumer Price Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH)).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

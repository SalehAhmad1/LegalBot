Sch. 1A inserted (31.12.2023) by The Water Resources (Control of Agricultural Pollution) (Wales) (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1393), reg. 1, Sch.
Application of Schedule 1A
1.  The following enhanced nutrient management requirements apply to the occupier of a qualifying grassland holding intending during the relevant period to apply to the holding, whether directly by an animal or by spreading, a total amount of nitrogen in grazing livestock manure which exceeds 170 kg multiplied by the area of the holding in hectares.
Interpretation
2.  In this Schedule—
“soil phosphorus index” (“mynegai ffosfforws pridd”) means a reference to the index number assigned to the soil in accordance with Table 1 of this Schedule, to indicate the level of phosphorus available from the soil;“soil sampling analysis” (“dadansoddiad samplu pridd”) means analysis of a soil sample carried out by a soil testing laboratory to analyse soils for phosphorus.
Livestock manure to be applied to the holding during relevant period
3.  The occupier must ensure that the only livestock manure to be applied to the holding during the relevant period, whether directly by an animal or by spreading, is manure produced by the livestock on the holding.
Soil sampling analysis
4.—(1) The occupier must, for the purposes of determining the soil phosphorus index for each area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type, undertake soil sampling analysis of at least every five hectares of the agricultural area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type.
(2) An occupier may rely on the results of previous soil sampling analysis of the agricultural area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), provided such sampling analysis was carried out within the period beginning with 1 January 2020 and ending with 31 December 2023.
(3) Where phosphorus soil sampling analysis of the agricultural area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type has not been carried out within the period referred to in sub-paragraph (2), such sampling analysis must be undertaken within the period beginning with 1 January 2024 and ending with 30 March 2024.
Determining the soil phosphorus index
5.  The occupier must determine the soil phosphorus index for each area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type by using the results from the soil sampling analysis under paragraph 4 and the values in the following table.
Table 1 – Phosphorus index

Planning the spreading of phosphate fertiliser
6.  In addition to the production of nitrogen spreading plans under regulation 6 (planning the spreading of nitrogen fertiliser) the occupier must, within the period beginning with 1 January 2024 and ending with 30 March 2024—
(a)
calculate the optimum amount of phosphate fertiliser (kg) that should be spread on the crop during the relevant period, taking into account the soil phosphorus index, and
(b)
produce a plan (“enhanced nutrient management plan”) for the spreading of phosphate fertiliser during the relevant period.
Requirements for enhanced nutrient management plans
7.—(1) The enhanced nutrient management plan for the holding must—
(a)
include a risk map, produced in accordance with paragraph 11(1), indicating the location of the fields to which the plan relates, and
(b)
clearly state in relation to any field referred to in the plan the type of fertiliser to be used.
(2) The enhanced nutrient management plan must record—
(a)
the soil phosphorus index for each area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type,
(b)
the optimum amount of phosphate fertiliser (kg) that should be spread on the crop, taking into account the soil phosphorus index,
(c)
the amount of nitrogen (kg) likely to be available for uptake by the crop from any organic manure intended to be spread for crop uptake in the growing season during the relevant period,
(d)
the amount of phosphate (kg) likely to be supplied to meet the requirement of the crop from any organic manure spread or intended to be spread during the relevant period, calculated in accordance with—
(i)
tables 1 and 2 (as applicable) of Schedule 1,
(ii)
sampling and analysis in accordance with Part 2 of Schedule 3, or
(iii)
technical analyses provided by the supplier,
(e)
the amount of manufactured nitrogen fertiliser (kg) required (that is, the optimum amount of nitrogen required by the crop less the amount of nitrogen that will be available for crop uptake from any organic manure spread during the relevant period), and
(f)
the amount of manufactured phosphate fertiliser (kg) required (that is, the optimum amount of phosphate required by the crop less the amount of phosphate supplied for crop uptake from any organic manure spread for the purpose of fertilising the crop during the relevant period).
Total phosphorus spread on a holding during relevant period
8.  Irrespective of the figure recorded in the enhanced nutrient management plan in accordance with paragraph 7(2)(b), the occupier must ensure that the total amount of—
(a)
phosphate from manufactured phosphate fertiliser, and
(b)
phosphate from organic manure, in the growing season in which it is spread,
does not, during the relevant period, exceed the limits set out in paragraph 9.
Maximum phosphate limits by crop
9.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), the total amount of phosphate spread on any crop listed in the first column of any of the tables below must not exceed the figure under the applicable soil phosphorus index number in the same table.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace—
(a)
the Nitrate Pollution Prevention (Wales) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/2506 (W. 245)) which control the application of nitrogen fertiliser in nitrate sensitive areas, and
(b)
the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Silage and Slurry) (Wales) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1493 (W. 136)) which regulate the custody and control of silage and slurry and provided the design and construction standards applicable for its storage.
These Regulations make provision concerning the protection of waters against pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources.
Principal Changes
Whereas the requirements under the Nitrate Pollution Prevention (Wales) Regulations 2013 applied only to holdings situated in designated Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, these requirements will now apply to all holdings in Wales. The majority of the measures in the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Silage and Slurry) (Wales) Regulations 2010 will continue to apply under these Regulations but the capacity requirements for the storage of organic manure and silage in those Regulations are superseded and mirror those in the Nitrate Pollution Prevention (Wales) Regulations 2013.
Furthermore, persons proposing to build or improve their storage facility for slurry or silage will be required to notify the Natural Resources Body for Wales (“NRBW”) 14 days before construction work is begun, replacing the previous requirement for notification prior to the storage facility’s actual use.
Occupiers of organic holdings wishing to benefit from the exemption to the closed periods for spreading organic manure with high readily available nitrogen (regulation 20) must now submit an undertaking to the control system referred to in Article 27 of Council Regulation (EC) 834/2007 rather than register with the Advisory Committee on Organic Standards which has now been dissolved.
The Regulations
Part 1 of these Regulations contains introductory provisions including transitional provision for all holdings not previously within a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone which are now required to comply with the relevant provisions and requirements under these Regulations.
Part 2 of these Regulations imposes annual limits on the amount of nitrogen from organic manure that may be applied or spread.
Part 3 establishes requirements relating to the amount of nitrogen to be spread on a crop, and requires an occupier to plan in advance how much nitrogen fertilizer will be spread.
Part 4 requires an occupier to provide a risk map of the holding, and imposes conditions on how, where and when to spread nitrogen fertilizer.
Part 5 establishes closed periods during which it is prohibited to spread nitrogen fertilizer.
Part 6 makes provision for the storage of organic manure and prescribes the capacity and construction requirements for such storage systems. It provides for exemptions from the requirements for certain storage systems; for NRBW to serve notices requiring the carrying out of works or precautions for reducing the risk of pollution to controlled waters and provides an appeal process against such notices. It also requires NRBW to be notified of certain works to be carried out to such storage systems.
Part 7 specifies what records must be kept.
Part 8 requires the Welsh Ministers to review these Regulations within set time scales, including a review after two years to consider any submissions on an alternative suite of measures to those in these Regulations for preventing or reducing pollution caused by agriculture.
Part 9 of these Regulations provides for enforcement and for contravention of certain regulations to be a criminal offence. These Regulations are enforced by NRBW.
Part 10 contains miscellaneous provisions including revocations.
These Regulations repeal and re-enact (without modification) technical regulations in the Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Silage and Slurry) (Wales) Regulations 2010.
British Standard publications referred to in these Regulations can be obtained from the British Standard Institute either online at https://shop.bsigroup.com/Contact-Us/ or by writing to BSI Customer Services, 389 Chiswick High Road, London, W4 4AL, UK.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

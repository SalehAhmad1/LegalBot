5 March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Adoption and Fostering (Wales) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 (“the 2020 Regulations”).
These Regulations extend the expiry date of the 2020 Regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The main effect of these Regulations is to amend the expiry date of regulations 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 of the 2020 Regulations by substituting 30 September 2021 for 31 March 2021. This means that the amendments made by regulations 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 of the 2020 Regulations continue to have effect until 30 September 2021.
The secondary effect of these Regulations is that the amendments made by regulation 5 of the 2020 Regulations will no longer expire on 31 March 2021.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely cost and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

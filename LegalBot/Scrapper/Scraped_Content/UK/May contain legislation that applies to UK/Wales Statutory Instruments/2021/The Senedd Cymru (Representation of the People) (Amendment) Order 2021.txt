At 4.13 p.m. on 17th March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) Order 2007 (“the 2007 Order”).
The 2007 Order was made by the Secretary of State, but the enabling powers were transferred to the Welsh Ministers by the Wales Act 2017. The Welsh Ministers made their first Order in relation to the conduct of Senedd Cymru elections in 2020, namely the Senedd Cymru (Representation of the People) (Amendment) Order 2020 (“the 2020 Order”).
Article 3 of this Order amends the 2007 Order to change the time for delivery of nomination papers to 4 p.m. on the 19th day before the day of the election.
Articles 4, 5 and 6 of this Order amend paragraphs 4, 6 and 7 of Schedule 5, and Part 2 of form CZ (Home address form) in Schedule 10, to the 2007 Order. The amendments require a candidate, who does not want their home address made public, to provide either their Senedd Cymru constituency, or if they reside outside Wales, their UK Parliamentary constituency where their home address is located. Form CZ is amended to reflect this change also.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Under section 160A(3) of the Housing Act 1996 (c. 52) (“the 1996 Act”), a person who is subject to immigration control is ineligible for an allocation of housing accommodation by a local authority unless they come within a class of persons prescribed in regulations made by the Welsh Ministers.
Under paragraph (1)2 of Schedule 2 to the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 (2014 anaw 7) (“the 2014 Act”), a person who is subject to immigration control is ineligible for housing assistance under Chapter 2 of Part 2 of that Act unless they come within a class of persons prescribed in regulations by the Welsh Ministers (or the Secretary of State).
These Regulations amend the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (Wales) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2603 (W. 257)) (“the 2014 Regulations”) which make provision for which persons who are subject to immigration control are eligible for an allocation of housing accommodation and for housing assistance.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 3 of the 2014 Regulations which relates to the eligibility of persons subject to immigration control for an allocation of housing accommodation under the 1996 Act. It prescribes an additional class of persons subject to immigration control who are eligible for an allocation of housing accommodation under the 1996 Act.
Class I applies to persons who are habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland and who have been given limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom under paragraph 405 of the Immigration Rules on the basis that they are a stateless person.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 5(1) of the 2014 Regulations which relates to the eligibility of persons subject to immigration control for housing assistance under the 2014 Act. It prescribes an additional class of persons who are eligible for such assistance: Class J - stateless persons (equivalent to Class I inserted by regulation 3).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

Section 33(4) of the Act requires the Welsh Ministers to set a limit on the amount of carbon units that may be credited to the net Welsh emissions account for a budgetary period.
Regulation 2 limits the number of carbon units that may be credited to the net Welsh emissions account for the budgetary period 2021-2025 to 0% of the carbon budget.
In accordance with section 49 of the Act, the Welsh Ministers have obtained and taken into account the advice of the advisory body before laying draft regulations.

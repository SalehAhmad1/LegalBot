(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Environmental Noise (Wales) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/2629 (W. 225)) (“the 2006 Regulations”) in order to implement Commission Directive (EU) 2015/996 of 19 May 2015 establishing common noise assessment methods according to Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ No L 168, 1.7.2015, p. 1).
These Regulations provide for new common noise assessment methods as set out in Annex II to Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise (OJ No L 189, 18.7.2002, p. 12) (“the Directive”), as amended by Commission Directive (EU) 2015/996.
Regulation 2(2) amends the definition of “Directive” in regulation 2(2) of the 2006 Regulations.
Regulation 2(3)(a) amends paragraph (3) of regulation 4 of the 2006 Regulations to require determination of the values of Lden, Lnight and supplementary noise indicators at the assessment position and in accordance with the methodology in Annex II to the Directive.
Regulation 2(3)(b) inserts a new paragraph (3A) into regulation 4 of the 2006 Regulations, which defines the term “assessment position” for the purposes of paragraph (3).
Paragraphs (4) and (5) of regulation 4 of, and Schedule 2 to, the 2006 Regulations are omitted.
Regulation 2(5) omits the supplementary noise indicator “LA10, 18h” in Schedule 3 of the 2006 Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of regulatory impact assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

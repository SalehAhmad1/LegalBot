(2) The requirements of this paragraph are—
(a)
that the water does not contain—
(i)
any micro-organism (other than a parameter listed in Schedule 1) or parasite, or
(ii)
any substance (other than a parameter listed in Schedule 1),
at a concentration or value which would constitute a potential danger to human health;

(6) Water transferred from a service reservoir for supply for regulation 4(1) purposes is to be regarded as unwholesome if more than 5% of samples taken in a year exceed the prescribed concentration for the coliform bacteria parameter.Interpretation and application of Part 4
5.—(1) In this Part “monitoring of a Group A parameter” means monitoring of a Group A parameter for the purpose of obtaining information at regular intervals—
(a)
as to the organoleptic and microbiological quality of water;
(b)
where relevant, as to the effectiveness of drinking water treatment, particularly for the purposes of disinfection, for the purposes referred to in paragraph (2); and
(c)
as regards indicator parameters, whether water supplied for regulation 4(1) purposes meets the specifications for those parameters.
(2) The purpose of monitoring of a Group A parameter is to determine whether the presence of such a parameter in water supplied for regulation 4(1) purposes satisfies the provisions of Part 3 or, if a departure has been authorised under Part 7 in relation to that supply, the provisions of Part 3 as read with the terms of that departure.
(3) In this Part, “monitoring of a Group B parameter” means monitoring of a Group B parameter for the purpose of obtaining information from which it may be established whether water supplied for regulation 4(1) purposes—
(a)
satisfies the provisions of Part 3 or, if a departure has been authorised under Part 7 in relation to that supply, the provisions of Part 3 as read with the terms of that departure;
(b)
meets the specifications for indicator parameters; and
(c)
in respect of other parameters identified as relevant by the Welsh Ministers under regulation 9, meets the specifications for those parameters.
(4) This Part applies to water supplied for regulation 4(1) purposes by a relevant supplier in the performance of its duties under Chapter III.
(5) Regulations 6 to 10 apply to a supplementary licensee in relation to samples taken from supply points as they apply to a water undertaker, but only in so far as the supplementary licensee is introducing water into a water supply zone in which the water undertaker takes samples under this Part (to the extent authorised by or under regulation 8) from supply points.Monitoring: general provisions
6.—(1) Paragraph (2) applies for the purpose of determining whether water to which this Part applies satisfies the provisions of Part 3 or, if a departure has been authorised under Part 7 in relation to that supply, those provisions as read with the terms of that authorisation.
(2) A water undertaker must take or cause to be taken, and analyse or cause to be analysed, not less than the number of samples of the water within each of the water supply zones which it supplies specified in, or in accordance with the provisions of, this Part and Schedule 3.
(3) Except in a case to which paragraph (4) applies, the parameters listed in Tables A and B in Schedule 1 and the indicator parameters must be subject to—
(a)
monitoring of a Group A parameter if the parameter is one listed in column 2 of Table 1 in Schedule 3, and the circumstances specified in column 3 of that Table apply; and
(b)
monitoring of a Group B parameter in any other case.
(4) Where the distribution of water in any part of a water supply zone is by tanker and is (or is likely to be) an intermittent short-term supply, samples of water from each tanker from which the water is distributed must be taken—
(a)
at the commencement of the distribution from that tanker; and
(b)
every 48 hours thereafter until the distribution is discontinued.
(5) Of the samples taken in accordance with paragraph (3) in relation to each distribution—
(a)
the first sample must be analysed for compliance with the following parameters—
(i)
E. coli (item 2 in Part 2 of Table A in Schedule 1); and
(ii)
conductivity (item 6 in Schedule 2); and
(b)
the second and any subsequent samples must be analysed for compliance with those and every other parameter.
(6) For the purposes of the application of paragraph (3)(b) to the aluminium, iron and manganese parameters (items 1, 9 and 10 in Table 1 in Schedule 3, a supply which consists of both groundwater and surface water will be deemed to be a supply which consists only of surface water.
(7) Compliance samples for chemical parameters, including copper, lead and nickel must take the form of a random daytime sample of one litre volume taken at a consumer's tap without prior flushing.
(8) A water undertaker must monitor each water supply zone within its area of supply for the radioactive parameters contained in Schedule 2 in accordance with paragraphs (9) to (16).
(9) As regards the indicative dose parameter—
(a)
monitoring must be carried out where an artificial source of radionuclides or elevated natural radioactivity is present and it cannot be shown on the basis of other representative monitoring programmes or other investigations that the level of indicative dose is below the value specified in Schedule 2;
(b)
where monitoring for natural radionuclide levels is required, the Welsh Ministers must define the frequency of the monitoring of either gross alpha activity, gross beta activity or individual natural radionuclides, depending on the screening strategy adopted in accordance with Schedule 4;
(c)
where the monitoring frequency defined in accordance with sub-paragraph (b) requires one sample per year for naturally occurring radioactivity, a further sample must be taken where any change occurs in relation to the supply that is likely to influence the concentrations of radionuclides in water supplied for regulation 4(1) purposes;
(d)
in the case of naturally occurring radionuclides where the results of the monitoring referred to in sub-paragraph (b) show that the concentration of radionuclides in the supply is stable, the minimum sampling and analysis frequencies are to be decided by the Welsh Ministers and confirmed by notice to the water undertaker, taking into account the risk to human health;
(e)
a water undertaker may use a screening strategy for gross alpha, gross beta activity or individual radionuclides and, in the event that there is any exceedance of the value specified in Schedule 2, it must carry out an analysis of the specific radionuclides in accordance with Schedule 4.
(10) As regards the radon parameter—
(a)
a water undertaker must ensure that a representative survey is carried out in accordance with paragraph (11) to determine the likelihood of a supply failing the parametric value for radon specified in Schedule 2; and
(b)
monitoring must be carried out where there is reason to believe, on the basis of the results of the representative surveys or other reliable information, that the parametric value for radon might be exceeded.
(11) A representative survey must be designed in such a way—
(a)
as to be capable of determining the scale and nature of likely exposures to radon in water intended for human consumption originating from different types of groundwater sources and wells in different geological areas; and
(b)
that the underlying parameters, in particular the geology and hydrology of the area, radioactivity of rock or soil, and well type, can be identified and used to direct further action to areas of likely high exposure.
(12) As regards the tritium parameter—
(a)
monitoring must be carried out where an anthropogenic source of tritium or other artificial radionuclides is present within the catchment area and it cannot be shown on the basis of other surveillance programmes or investigations that the level of tritium is below the parametric value specified in Schedule 2; and
(b)
if the concentration of tritium exceeds its parametric value, an investigation of the presence of other artificial radionuclides must be carried out.
(13) Where a parametric value is exceeded in a particular sample, the Welsh Ministers must define the extent of re-sampling necessary to ensure that the measured values are representative of an average activity concentration for a full year.
(14) The Welsh Ministers may notify a water undertaker which supplies water to a water supply zone that a radioactive parameter need not be monitored if the Welsh Ministers are satisfied that, for the period specified in the notice, the water supplied to that zone for regulation 4(1) purposes—
(a)
gives rise to a calculated indicative dose that is below the parametric value specified in Schedule 2;
(b)
contains levels of radon that are below the parametric value specified in Schedule 2;
(c)
contains levels of tritium that are below the parametric value specified in Schedule 2.
(15) Where paragraph (14) applies, the Welsh Ministers must [F1 publish, in such manner as the Welsh Ministers consider appropriate, the grounds for the notification ] with the necessary documentation supporting the decision (including the findings of any surveys, monitoring or investigations carried out).
(16) The Welsh Ministers must by notice in writing withdraw a notice under paragraph (14)—
(a)
given in relation to the indicative dose parameter, if the Welsh Ministers believe that water supplied to the zone in question for regulation 4(1) purposes gives rise to a calculated indicative dose that is likely to exceed the parametric value specified in Schedule 2;
(b)
given in relation to the radon parameter, if the Welsh Ministers believe that water supplied to the zone in question for regulation 4(1) purposes contains levels of radon that are likely to exceed the parametric value specified in Schedule 2;
(c)
given in relation to the tritium parameter, if the Welsh Ministers believe that water supplied to the zone in question for regulation 4(1) purposes contains levels of tritium that are likely to exceed the parametric value specified in Schedule 2.
(17) A water undertaker which receives a notice under paragraph (16) must monitor or cause to be monitored the indicative dose parameter or, as the case may be, the radon or tritium parameter, in accordance with Tables 8 to 13 (as applicable) in Schedule 3.

7.  Except in relation to water supplied from a tanker, sampling points in respect of every parameter, other than a parameter for which samples are taken from a supply point authorised by or under regulation 8, must be selected at random unless, by notice in writing to a water undertaker (whether or not on the application of the water undertaker), the Welsh Ministers otherwise determine.Authorisation of supply points
8.—(1) For those parameters specified as item 6 in column 1 of Table 1, and [F1items 1 to 12] and 14 to 21 in column 1 of Table 3, in Schedule 3, samples may be taken from —
(a)
any blending point;
(b)
the water leaving any service reservoir which receives water from a treatment works before its supply to any consumer; and
(c)
the water leaving any treatment works.
(2) If the Welsh Ministers are satisfied that analysis of those samples will produce data which are unlikely to differ in any material respect from the data that would be produced from analysis within the sampling points, the Welsh Ministers may authorise the use for the purposes of regulation 6 of those samples taken for a water supply zone from a blending point, a service reservoir of that description or a treatment works.
(3) In respect of any water supply zone, the taking of samples from a supply point is not authorised by paragraph (2) where a supplementary licensee introduces water into the water supply zone unless the water quality within the water supply zone remains approximately uniform.
(4) Subject to paragraph (6), the Welsh Ministers may, in relation to any parameter not covered by an authorisation under paragraph (2), on the written application of a water undertaker or on the joint written application of a water undertaker and supplementary licensee, authorise the use for the purposes of regulation 6 of samples taken for a water supply zone otherwise than from a sampling point.
(5) An authorisation under paragraph (4) may extend to all samples in relation to that parameter or to such number or proportion of those samples as is specified in the authorisation.
(6) The Welsh Ministers must not grant an authorisation under paragraph (4) unless they are satisfied that analysis of samples taken from a point other than a sampling point will produce data in respect of the parameter in question which are unlikely to differ in any material respect from the data that would be produced in respect of that parameter from analysis of samples obtained from sampling points.
(7) Subject to paragraph (8), the Welsh Ministers may at any time modify or revoke an authorisation under paragraph (4).
(8) Unless it appears to the Welsh Ministers that the immediate modification or revocation of an authorisation under paragraph (4) is required in the interests of public health, they must not modify or revoke such an authorisation without giving to the water undertaker to which the authorisation relates at least 6 weeks' notice of their intention to modify or revoke.
(9) A water undertaker must notify the Welsh Ministers as soon as it has reasonable grounds for believing that an analysis of samples taken for a water supply zone from a point other than a sampling point would produce data in respect of the parameter in question which would differ in a material respect from the data produced by an analysis of samples taken from any of the sampling points within that zone.
(10) On being notified under paragraph (9) and without the need for prior notice to the water undertaker, the Welsh Ministers must revoke the authorisation.

O.J. No L 327, 22.12.2000, p 1, as last amended by Commission Directive 2014/101/EU (OJ No L 311, 31.10.2014, p 32).Sampling: further provisions
10.—(1) Paragraph (2) applies as soon as a relevant supplier has reasonable grounds for believing that any element, organism or substance, other than a residual disinfectant or a parameter (whether alone or in combination with any parameter or any other element, organism or substance) may cause the supply within any of the water supply zones which it supplies to be a supply which does not satisfy—
(a)
the provisions of Part 3; or
(b)
if a departure has been authorised under Part 7, those provisions as read with the terms of that authorisation.
(2) Where this paragraph applies, the relevant supplier must take or cause to be taken sufficient samples from water within that zone (whether from a service reservoir, a treatment works or otherwise) in respect of any element, organism or substances, in order to establish whether that water is wholesome.Sampling for particular substances and parameters
11.—(1) For the purposes of establishing the quality of water to be supplied to any of its water supply zones, a water undertaker must take, or cause to be taken, and analyse, or cause to be analysed, not less than the number of samples specified in this Part.
(2) For the purposes of establishing the quality of water to be supplied in any supply system into which a supplementary licensee introduces water, a supplementary licensee must take, or cause to be taken, and analyse, or cause to be analysed, not less than the number of samples specified in this Part.Sampling at treatment works
12.—(1) Subject to paragraph (3), in each year every water undertaker or supplementary licensee must take, or cause to be taken, from the point at which water leaves each treatment works which it uses to supply water to water supply zones, the standard number of samples for analysis—
(a)
for determining the concentration of residual disinfectant;
(b)
for determining whether, in relation to the colony counts and turbidity parameters, water leaving treatment works meets the specifications for those parameters set out in Schedule 2; and
(c)
for testing for compliance with the prescribed concentrations or values in respect of the coliform bacteria, E coli, and nitrite parameters for water leaving treatment works.
(2) Samples required to be taken by this regulation must be taken at regular intervals.
(3) Where a particular treatment works is in use for part only of a year, the minimum number of samples to be taken from that works in that year must bear to the standard number or, as the case may be, the number specified in a current notice given by the Welsh Ministers under regulation 9 which departs from the standard number, the same proportion as the number of days in that year in which the treatment works have been in use bears to 365.
(4) In this regulation, “the standard number” has the same meaning as in regulation 9.Sampling at service reservoirs
13.—(1) Every water undertaker or supplementary licensee must take, or cause to be taken, from each of its service reservoirs in each week in which the reservoir is in use or as directed by notification by the Welsh Ministers under regulation 9(4), one sample for analysis—
(a)
for testing for compliance with the prescribed concentrations or values in respect of the parameters E coli and coliform bacteria;
(b)
for determining the concentration of residual disinfectant; and
(c)
for determining whether the specification in relation to the colony counts parameter is met.Sampling: new sources
14.—(1) This regulation applies in relation to—
(a)
any source which has not previously been used for the supply of water by a water undertaker or supplementary licensee; and
(b)
any source which has been so used but not so used for a period of 6 months preceding the date on which the water undertaker or supplementary licensee proposes to supply water from it.
(2) Every water undertaker or supplementary licensee must take, or cause to be taken, in accordance with paragraph (3) and (4), such samples of that water as will enable it to establish —
(a)
whether water can be supplied from that source without contravening section 68(1) of the Act (duties of water undertakers and licensed water suppliers with respect to water quality) M1; and
(b)
the treatment necessary to ensure that section 68(1) of the Act is complied with in relation to the supply of that water.
(3) The samples must be taken or caused to be taken—
(a)
before the water undertaker or supplementary licensee supplies water from a source mentioned in paragraph (1)(a);
(b)
as soon as is reasonably practicable after the water undertaker or supplementary licensee has begun to supply water from a source mentioned in paragraph (1)(b).
(4) Samples must be taken—
(a)
in the case of a source mentioned in paragraph (1)(a), in respect of—
(i)
the parameters listed in Schedules 1 and 2; and
(ii)
any other element, organism or substance which, in the opinion of the water undertaker or supplementary licensee proposing to use the source, may cause the supply to contravene section 68(1) of the Act;
(b)
in the case of a source mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), in respect of—
(i)
the parameters listed in Table A in Schedule 1;
(ii)
the conductivity, hydrogen ion and turbidity parameters; and

any other parameter as regards which the water undertaker or supplementary licensee proposing to use the source is of the opinion that its concentration or value is likely to have altered since the last occasion on which water from that source was analysed.
(5) Unless the conditions in paragraph (6) are satisfied, a water undertaker or supplementary licensee must not supply water from a source mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) for regulation 4(1) purposes until 1 month has passed following the day on which the water undertaker or supplementary licensee complied with regulation 28(1) with respect to that source.
(6) The conditions are that the water undertaker or supplementary licensee—
(a)
must supply water from the source as a matter of urgency in order to prevent an unexpected interruption in piped supply to consumers; and
(b)
before the supply is made, has carried out a risk assessment under regulation 27 specifically with respect to the source.
(7) For the purposes of paragraph (6)(b), regulation 27 will apply to supplies made as a matter of urgency as if “treatment works” includes a source from which untreated water is supplied.

19.—(1) Where a water undertaker or supplementary licensee has reason to believe that water of a relevant description does not meet the specifications for indicator parameters set out in Schedule 2, it must immediately take such steps as are necessary to identify—
(a)
whether water of a relevant description does or does not meet the specifications;
(b)
the indicator parameters in respect of which the specifications are not met;
(c)
if the specification for the coliform bacteria or colony counts parameter (items 4 and 5 in Schedule 2) is not met, whether the inability to meet that specification is attributable—

send a copy of that notice to any other relevant supplier which uses the supply system for the purposes of supplying water to consumers who are likely to be affected by the failure.
(3) Where, in a case to which paragraph (1)(c) applies, the inability to meet the specification has been identified as attributable to the domestic distribution system or to the maintenance of that system, the water undertaker or supplementary licensee must, at the same time as notification is given under paragraph (2)—
(a)
by notice in writing—
(i)
to those of its consumers who are likely to be affected by the failure; and

(a)
a notification given in accordance with regulation 18(5) in the circumstances mentioned in regulation 18(3)(b) discloses—
(i)
a failure in relation to any parameter specified in Table B in Schedule 1, and
(ii)
that the failure is not attributable to the domestic distribution system or the maintenance of that system, and
(b)
it appears to the Welsh Ministers that the failure in respect of that parameter is not trivial and is likely to recur,
the Welsh Ministers must consider whether to vary the terms of an authorisation under regulation 22.
(4) Where—
(a)
a notification given in accordance with regulation 19(2) discloses an inability to meet the specification applicable to an indicator parameter, and
(b)
the Welsh Ministers consider that the inability poses a potential danger to human health,

subject to subsection (10) may recover any expenses reasonably incurred by the undertaker in taking those steps from the person on whom the notice was served.”
(6) Where the water undertaker exercises the power in section 75(2) of the Act pursuant to a notice served by the Welsh Ministers under paragraph (3) it must inform by notice in writing any of its other consumers who are likely to be affected, of the steps it has taken, and that notice must include a copy of any notice that it has served.
(7) Where the Welsh Ministers consider that the failure (or any aspect of it) is attributable to factors arising from the further distribution by a person other than a water undertaker or water supply licensee of water supplied by a water undertaker or water supply licensee, the Welsh Ministers—
(a)
must not serve a notice under paragraph (3) in respect of that failure or aspect of it; and
(b)
if the Welsh Ministers consider that the local authority needs information or assistance from the water undertaker or water supply licensee in order to be able to carry out its duties under regulation 17 (provision of information) or 18 (investigation) of the Private Water Supplies (Wales) Regulations 2017 M3, the Welsh Ministers must serve a notice on the water undertaker or water supply licensee requiring it to provide such information or assistance to the local authority as is specified in the notice.
(8) The water undertaker or water supply licensee on which a notice under this regulation has been served must take the steps specified in the notice as soon as possible.

(a)
disinfect the water; and
(b)
where necessary, subject the water to sufficient preliminary treatment to prepare it for disinfection.

water is supplied for regulation 4(1) purposes when it leaves a treatment works.Risk assessment
27.—(1) This regulation applies to every treatment works and supply system from which water is supplied for regulation 4(1) purposes.
(2) Every water undertaker or supplementary licensee must carry out a risk assessment of each of its treatment works and connected supply system in order to establish whether there is a significant risk of supplying water from those works or supply system that would constitute a potential danger to human health or is likely to be unwholesome.
(3) Every water undertaker or supplementary licensee must keep its risk assessments under continuous review.
(4) The Welsh Ministers may by notice served on a water undertaker or supplementary licensee, require a risk assessment or review to be carried out by a date specified in the notice.
(5) Where a water undertaker or supplementary licensee becomes aware of any factors which make it likely that a risk assessment under this regulation would establish that there is a significant risk of supplying water that would constitute a potential danger to human health, or that is likely to be unwholesome, it must serve a notice on the Welsh Ministers specifying the relevant factors.Procedure following risk assessment and prohibition of supply
28.—(1) As soon as reasonably practicable after a water undertaker or supplementary licensee has carried out a risk assessment or review of such assessment under regulation 27, it must submit to the Welsh Ministers a report of the assessment or review.
(2) The report must contain—
(a)
a description of the methods used to carry out the assessment or review;
(b)
where the assessment or review establishes that there is no significant risk of supplying water that could constitute a potential danger to human health or could be unwholesome, a statement confirming this; and
(c)
where the assessment or review establishes that measures have been taken to remove a significant risk of supplying water that could constitute a potential danger to human health or could be unwholesome—
(i)
monitoring data which verifies this; and
(ii)
details of those measures.
(3) Where the assessment or review establishes that there is a significant risk of supplying water that could constitute a potential danger to human health or could be unwholesome, the report must—
(a)
contain a full explanation including details of every property, organism or substance that has been identified as contributing to the risk; and
(b)
specify the measures that the water undertaker or supplementary licensee—
(i)
has made operational as at the date of the report; and
(ii)
intends to make operational, to mitigate the risk.
(4) Where the Welsh Ministers have received a report which states that there is or has been a significant risk of supplying water that could constitute a potential danger to human health or could be unwholesome, they may, by notice served on the water undertaker or supplementary licensee, require the water undertaker or supplementary licensee—
(a)
to maintain such specified measures for such period of time as the Welsh Ministers consider appropriate to mitigate the risk;
(b)
to review, revise or make operational such specified measures by such date as the Welsh Ministers consider appropriate to mitigate the risk;
(c)
to audit whether the measures have been effective by such means as may be specified;
(d)
not to supply water for regulation 4(1) purposes from specified treatment works or supply systems, or not to so supply unless specified conditions are satisfied; and
(e)
to give the Welsh Ministers such information as they may require to monitor progress towards mitigation of that risk.
(5) In paragraph (4), “specified” means specified in the notice served under that paragraph.
(6) The Welsh Ministers may, by notice served on the relevant water undertaker or supplementary licensee, revoke or amend a notice served under paragraph (4).Water treatment to minimise contamination from pipes
29.—(1) Paragraph (2) applies where there is a risk (“the prescribed risk”) that water supplied by a relevant supplier would, for the reason mentioned in paragraph (3), after leaving the relevant supplier's pipes—
(a)
contain a concentration of copper in excess of 2 mg/litre; or
(b)
contain a concentration of lead in excess of 10 μg/litre.
(2) Every water undertaker or supplementary licensee which introduces water into the supply system used by the relevant supplier must, subject to paragraph (4), treat the water in such a way as will, in its opinion, eliminate the prescribed risk or reduce it to a minimum.
(3) The reason referred to in paragraph (1) is the presence in the water of a concentration of copper or lead which is attributable to the fact that copper or lead is the major component of such a pipe as is mentioned in section 68(3)(a) M1 of the Act, or its associated fittings.
(4) Paragraph (1) will not require a water undertaker or supplementary licensee to treat water—
(a)
if the treatment is unlikely to achieve a significant reduction in the concentration of copper or lead; or
(b)
if treatment is not reasonably practicable.

(b)
of information mentioned in any other sub-paragraph of paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) at any time more than 5 years after the date on which the information was first entered in the record.Provision of information
35.—(1) Any person may request a relevant supplier to send to the person making the request a copy of any record maintained by the relevant supplier under regulation 34 and the relevant supplier must, within 7 days of the receipt of the request, send a copy of the record requested to the person who requested it.
(2) A relevant supplier must comply with a request under paragraph (1)—
(a)
in the case of a request relating to a water supply zone, free of charge if the person receives a supply of water in the zone; or
(b)
in any other case, on payment of such reasonable charge as the relevant supplier may determine.
(3) Paragraph (1) does not oblige a relevant supplier to comply with a request which is vexatious.
(4) Where a relevant supplier has previously complied with a request which was made by any person, paragraph (1) does not oblige it to comply with a subsequent identical or substantially similar request from that person unless a reasonable interval has elapsed between compliance with the previous request and the making of the subsequent request.
(5) A water undertaker must include in, or append to, at least one of the accounts sent to each customer in any year a statement informing customers of their rights under paragraph (1).
(6) As soon as possible after an event which, by reason of its effect or likely effect on the water supplied by a relevant supplier, gives rise or is likely to give rise to a significant risk to human health the relevant supplier must notify—
(a)
in every case—
(i)
every appropriate local authority;
(ii)
the Public Health Wales National Health Service Trust;
(iii)
the Council; and
(iv)
the Welsh Ministers; and
(b)
in any case where the event gives rise or is likely to give rise to a significant risk to human health in England—
(i)
Public Health England; and
(ii)
the Secretary of State.
(7) Where a person has received a notification under paragraph (6), that person may require the relevant supplier to provide such further information relating to the event and its consequences as that person may reasonably require.Application and interpretation of this Part
36.—(1) This Part applies to the performance by a local authority of their duty under section 77(1) of the Act (general functions of local authorities in relation to water quality) insofar as that duty relates to water supplies which are not private supplies.
(2) In this Part “specified relevant supplier”, in relation to a local authority, means—
(a)
a water undertaker any of whose water supply zones include an area which is situated within the area of that authority; or
(b)
a water supply licensee which uses any such water supply zones for the purposes of supplying water to consumers.Duties of local authorities: supplementary provision
37.—(1) In performing their duty under section 77(1) of the Act, a local authority—
(a)
must make such arrangements with the specified relevant supplier as will secure that the authority is notified as mentioned in regulation 35(6)(a)(i); and
(b)
may take, or cause to be taken, and analyse, or cause to be analysed, by a person designated by them in writing, such samples of the water supplied to premises in their area as they may reasonably require.
(2) Regulation 15 applies to samples taken by virtue of paragraph (1) as it applies to samples taken for the purposes of Parts 4 and 5 of these Regulations, but regulation 15(1) is to be read as if for the words “water undertaker or supplementary licensee” there were to be substituted “ local authority ”.Contraventions by relevant suppliers
38.  Any duty or requirement imposed by Parts 4 to 9 of these Regulations on a relevant supplier will be enforceable under section 18 of the Act by the Welsh Ministers or the Authority M1, whether or not the duty or requirement constitutes an offence.

2.—(1) If one of the activity concentrations exceeds 20% of the corresponding derived value or the tritium concentration exceeds its parametric value listed in Schedule 2 an analysis of additional radionuclides is required.
(2) In deciding which radionuclides are required to be measured for each supply, a water undertaker must take into account all relevant information about likely sources of radioactivity.
Screening strategies for gross alpha activity and gross beta activity
3.—(1) A water undertaker may use a screening strategy for gross alpha and gross beta to monitor for the parametric indicator value for indicative dose.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) the recommended screening values are—
(a)
0,1Bq/l for gross alpha activity; and
(b)
1,0Bq/l for gross beta activity M1.
(3) If the gross alpha activity exceeds 0,1Bq/l or the gross beta activity exceeds 1,0Bq/l, analysis for specific radionuclides is required.
(4) The Welsh Ministers may set alternative screening levels for gross alpha activity and gross beta activity where it can be demonstrated by the water undertaker that the alternative levels are in compliance with an indicative dose of 0,1 mSv.
(5) The radionuclides to be measured must be based on all relevant information about likely sources of radioactivity.

M1
Where appropriate, gross beta activity may be replaced by residual beta activity after subtraction of the K-40 activity concentration.
Calculation of the indicative dose
4.—(1) The indicative dose must be calculated from—
(a)
the measured radionuclide concentrations and the dose coefficients referred to as “standard values and relationships” in Article 13, and recommended for the estimation of doses from internal exposure in the definition of “standard values and relationships” in Article 4(96), of Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation M2;or
(b)
more recent information recognised by the Welsh Ministers, on the basis of the annual intake of water (730 l for adults).
(2) Where the following formula is satisfied, it can be assumed that the indicative dose is less than the parametric value of 0,1 mSv and no further investigation is required—
where—
“Ci(obs)” means observed concentration of radionuclide I;
“Ci(der)” means derived concentration of radionuclide i;
“n” means number of radionuclides detected.
Table 1
Derived concentrations for radioactivity in water intended for human consumption
This table includes values for the most common natural and artificial radionuclides: these are precise values, calculated for a dose of 0.1 mSy, an annual intake of 730 litres and using the dose coefficients referred to as “standard values and relationships” in Article 13, and recommended for the estimation of doses from internal exposure in the definition of “standard values and relationships” in Article 4(96), of Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom. Derived concentrations for other radionuclides can be calculated on the same basis, and values can be updated on the basis of more recent information recognised by the Welsh Ministers.

Performance characteristics and methods of analysis
For the following parameters and radionuclides, the method of analysis used must, as a minimum, be capable of measuring activity concentrations with a limit of detection specified below:
1 The limit of detection must be calculated according to the ISO standard 11929: Determination of the characteristic limits (decision threshold, detection limit, and limits of confidence interval) for measurements of ionising radiation – Fundamentals and application, with probabilities of errors of 1st and 2nd kind of 0,05 each.
2 Measurement uncertainties must be calculated and reported as complete standard uncertainties, or as expanded uncertainties with an expansion factor of 1,96 according the ISO Guide for the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement.
3 The limit of detection for tritium and for radon is 10% of its parametric value of 100 Bq/1.
4 The limit of detection for gross alpha activity and gross beta activities are 40% of the screening values of 0,1 and 1,0 Bq/1 respectively.
5 This limit of detection applies only to initial screening for indicative dose for a new water source; if initial checking indicates that it is not plausible that Ra-228 exceeds 20% of the derived concentration, the limit of detection may be increased to 0,08 Bq/1 for routine Ra-228 nuclide specific measurements, until a subsequent re-check is required.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations supplement Chapter III (Water Supply) of the Water Industry Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”) and revoke and replace the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2010. They are primarily concerned with the quality of water supplied by water undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales (and water supply licensees using the supply systems of such undertakers) for drinking, washing, cooking and food preparation, and for food production, and with arrangements for the publication of information about water quality.
The Regulations implement Council Directive 98/83/EC (OJ No L 330, 5.12.98, p. 32) (“the 1998 Directive”), on the quality of water intended for human consumption and their purpose is to protect human health from the adverse effects of any contamination of water intended for human consumption by ensuring that it is wholesome and clean. They also transpose the requirements of Council Directive 2013/51/Euratom laying down requirements for the protection of the health of the general public with regard to radioactive substances in water intended for human consumption (OJ No L 296, 7.11.2013, p 12).
Part 1 of the Regulations (regulations 1 and 2) contains preliminary provisions and defines terms that are used in the Regulations.
Part 2 (regulation 3) requires water undertakers to identify annually the areas (“water supply zones”) that are to be relevant for a particular year for the purposes of the application of provisions of the Regulations. A water supply zone may not comprise an area in which the estimated population exceeds 100,000. Water undertakers may not alter the boundaries of water supply zones during the year.
Part 3 (regulation 4) prescribes standards of wholesomeness in respect of water that is supplied for human consumption by water undertakers, including for domestic purposes including cooking, drinking food preparation or washing, or for food production purposes. These various purposes are referred to in the Regulations as “regulation 4(1) purposes”. In particular, regulation 4 provides that water is to be regarded as wholesome if it contains concentrations or values in respect of various properties, elements, organisms and substances that do not contravene prescribed maximum and, in some cases, minimum concentrations or values.
Part 4 (regulations 5 to 10) provides for the monitoring of water supplies. Regulation 5 defines two monitoring regimes; “monitoring of a Group A parameter” and “monitoring of a Group B parameter”. Regulation 6 sets out general monitoring provisions relating to the parameters set out in Schedules 1 (prescribed concentrations and values) and 2 (indicator parameters). Regulation 6 imposes requirements for the monitoring of indicative dose, radon and tritium (“radioactive parameters”) and introduces the additional monitoring provisions for the indicative dose parameter in Schedule 4 (Monitoring for indicative does and analytical performance characteristics). Regulation 6 also makes provision for monitoring supplies from tankers. Regulation 7 requires water undertakers to select at random the points at which samples are to be taken for the purposes of monitoring (referred to as “sampling points”). Regulation 8 provides that the Welsh Ministers may authorise the taking of samples from points other than sampling points. Regulation 9 deals with the number of samples to be taken. These are specified in Schedule 3 (Monitoring). Regulation 10 requires samples to be taken where water undertakers have reason to believe that the quality of the water within their water supply zone has been adversely affected by the presence of certain elements, organisms or substances.
Part 5 (regulations 11 to 16) contains additional provisions relating to sampling. Regulations 12 and 13 require samples to be taken in respect of particular organisms and substances, at treatment works and at reservoirs which store treated water. Regulation 14 requires samples to be taken before water is supplied from new sources and from sources which have not recently been used. Regulation 15 prescribes requirements relating to the taking, handling, storage, transport and analysis of samples. Regulation 16 provides an alternative method of analysis to that in regulation 15(6)(b) that may be used by a water undertaker or supplementary licensee before 23:59 on 31 December 2019.
Part 6 (regulation 17) requires water undertakers and supplementary licensees to identify every point from which they abstract water for supply for regulation 4(1) purposes and to take samples from those points to comply with regulations 26 to 28. This implements Article 8(1) and (2) of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (OJ No L 327, 22.12.2000, p 1).
Part 7 (regulations 18 to 25) requires water undertakers and supplementary licensees to investigate the cause of any failure, or apprehended failure, of any parameters set out in Schedule 1 or any indicator parameters set out in Schedule 2 and to notify the Welsh Ministers. Where the failure is attributable to a domestic distribution system or the maintenance of that system, notification must be provided to the consumers of the affected water supply and to any other relevant supplier. Regulations 20 provides for actions that may be taken by the Welsh Ministers upon receipt of a notification under regulation 18 or 19. Where a failure relates to a parameter in Table B in Schedule 1, and certain other conditions are met, the Welsh Ministers may require the supplier to apply for an authorisation for a departure from the requirements of Part 3 of the Regulations. The circumstances in which authorisations may be granted and the conditions to which they are subject are set out in regulations 22 and 23. Provision is made in regulation 24 for publicising authorisations. Regulation 25 provides for the revocation and variation of authorisations.
Part 8 (regulations 26 to 33) deals with the treatment of water and regulates the substances, processes and products that may be used by water undertakers in connection with the supply of water. Regulation 26 imposes requirements relating to the disinfection of water and imposes additional requirements for the treatment of surface water. Regulation 27 provides for the carrying out of risk assessments and subsequent reviews. Regulation 28 requires water undertakers and supplementary licensees to submit reports of risk assessments and reviews to the Welsh Ministers. Paragraph (4) of regulation 28 sets out the steps that the Welsh Ministers may take on receipt of a report which states there is or has been a significant risk of supplying water that could constitute a potential danger to human health or could be unwholesome. Regulation 29 requires water undertakers and supplementary licensees to treat water to minimise the risk of copper and lead contamination from pipes. Regulation 30 sets out provisions relating to the replacement or modification of lead pipes Regulation 31 specifies the circumstances in which water undertakers and supplementary licensees may apply or introduce substances or products into water supplied for regulation 4(1) purposes. Regulation 32 enables the Welsh Ministers to require that its approval be obtained to the use of processes in connection with the supply of water for regulation 4(1) purposes. Under regulation 33, contravention of specified requirements of regulations 26, 28, 31 and 32 are criminal offences, as is the making of false statements.
Part 9 (regulations 34 and 35) deals with the provision of information by water undertakers, supplementary licensees and retail licensees.
Part 10 (regulations 36 and 37) imposes requirements on local authorities in the performance of their duties in relation to the quality of water supplied by water undertakers or water supply licensees.
Part 11 (regulation 38) provides that contraventions by any relevant supplier of duties or requirements imposed by Parts 4 to 9 of the Regulations are to be enforceable under section 18 of the 1991 Act by the Welsh Ministers. This provision is additional to the criminal sanctions provided by regulation 33.
Part 12 (regulations 39 and 40) provides for transitional provisions, amendments and revocations (as set out in Schedule 6 (Amendments and revocations)).
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for interim emissions targets under Part 2 of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016.
The purpose of Part 2 of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 is to require the Welsh Ministers to meet targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from Wales. Section 29 requires that the Welsh Ministers ensure that the net Welsh emissions account for the year 2050 is at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline.
Section 30 requires that the Welsh Ministers make regulations to set interim emissions targets for the years 2020, 2030 and 2040. These targets are expressed as a percentage below the baseline.
Regulation 3 sets targets to reduce the net Welsh emissions account for the interim target years of 2020, 2030 and 2040.
In accordance with section 32 of the Act, the Welsh Ministers have satisfied themselves that the interim emissions targets are consistent with meeting the 2050 target and in drafting these regulations have had regard to the factors listed in section 32(3).
In accordance with section 49 of the Act, the Welsh Ministers have obtained and taken into account the advice of the advisory body before laying draft regulations.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

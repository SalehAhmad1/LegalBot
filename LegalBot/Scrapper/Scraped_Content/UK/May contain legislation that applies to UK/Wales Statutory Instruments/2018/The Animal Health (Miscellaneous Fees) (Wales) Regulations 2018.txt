These Regulations set out fees payable to the Welsh Ministers in the field of animal health, replacing the existing fees in the Animal Health (Miscellaneous Fees) (Wales) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/1241 (W. 133)). The fees are collected by the Animal & Plant Health Agency (APHA) on behalf of the Welsh Ministers. These Regulations apply in relation to Wales.
The fees in regulation 4 and Schedule 1 are payable in relation to activities required under Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the control of salmonella and other specified food-borne zoonotic agents (OJ No L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 1) and in accordance with Salmonella National Control Programmes for poultry.

This Order designates the county of Carmarthenshire as a civil enforcement area for bus lane and moving traffic contraventions for the purposes of Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004. The county of Carmarthenshire is already designated as a civil enforcement area for parking contraventions under that Act by the Road Traffic (Permitted Parking Area and Special Parking Area) (County of Carmarthenshire) Order 2004 (S.I. 2004/104 (W. 11)), which is deemed by paragraph 8(4) of Schedule 8 to the Act to be an order designating the area as a civil enforcement area for parking contraventions under paragraph 8 of Schedule 8 to the Act.
The practical effect of the Order is to enable Carmarthenshire County Council to enforce bus lane and moving traffic contraventions within the county of Carmarthenshire through a civil law regime.

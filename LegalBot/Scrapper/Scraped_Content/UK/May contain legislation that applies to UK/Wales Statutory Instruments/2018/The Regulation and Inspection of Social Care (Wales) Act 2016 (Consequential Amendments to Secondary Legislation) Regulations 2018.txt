(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under section 186 of the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016 (“the Act”).
The Act introduces a new system of regulation for care and support services in Wales, replacing that established by the Care Standards Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”).
Part 1 of the Act replaces the system of registration for the providers of social care services, set out in Parts 1 and 2 of the 2000 Act, where establishments and agencies were registered. This required a separate registration for each location where a service was provided.
The Act takes a different approach which is service based. A provider must register with the Welsh Ministers in order to provide any care and support service which is regulated under the Act and that registration will contain the details of all the locations at which the provider provides the regulated service.
Part 1 of the Act is commenced on 2 April 2018 in relation to the following regulated services:
(a)
a care home service;
(b)
a secure accommodation service;
(c)
a residential family centre service; and
(d)
a domiciliary support service.
Establishments and agencies that provide adoption, fostering and adult placements will remain subject to registration and inspection under the 2000 Act until the commencement in full of Part 1 of the Act.
Regulation 2 and Schedule 1 make amendments to secondary legislation as a consequence of this partial commencement.
Regulation 3 and Schedule 2 specify the secondary legislation revoked by these Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

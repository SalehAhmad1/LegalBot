(2) Where this regulation applies, G may qualify for the support specified in the notification for such period as the Welsh Ministers think appropriate.
(3) But this regulation does not apply if the notification is incorrect because the information provided by G was materially inaccurate.Further restriction on support for part-time students

28.—(1) Where an eligible student transfers from a designated course (in this Section, the “old course”) to another designated course (in this Section, the “new course”), the Welsh Ministers must transfer the student's status as an eligible student to the new course if—
(a)
they receive a request from the student to do so,
(b)
they are satisfied that one of the grounds of transfer applies (see paragraph (2)), and
(c)
the student's period of eligibility has not ended or been terminated.
(2) The grounds of transfer are—
First ground
The eligible student ceases the old course and undertakes the new course at the same institution.
Including—
(a)
where the old course is not a compressed degree course, undertaking the same course as a compressed degree course, or
(b)
where the old course is a compressed degree course, undertaking the same course on a non-compressed basis.
Second ground
The eligible student undertakes the new course at another institution.
Third ground
After commencing a course for the Certificate in Education, the eligible student is, on or before the completion of that course, admitted to a designated course for the degree (including an honours degree) of Bachelor of Education.
Fourth ground
After commencing a course for the degree (other than an honours degree) of Bachelor of Education, the eligible student is, on or before completion of that course, admitted to a designated course for the honours degree of Bachelor of Education.
Fifth ground
After commencing a course for a first degree (other than an honours degree) the eligible student is, before the completion of that course, admitted to a designated course for an honours degree in the same subject at the same institution.Effect of transfer – tuition fee loans
29.  Where the Welsh Ministers transfer an eligible student's status under regulation 28 during an academic year, the amount of tuition fee loan payable in respect of that academic year is to be determined by the Welsh Ministers as follows—
Step 1
Calculate, in accordance with Part 6, the amounts of tuition fee loan that would have been payable in respect of—
(a)
the old course, and
(b)
the new course,
for the whole academic year.
Step 2
Reduce those amounts by such proportion as the Welsh Ministers think appropriate having regard to—
(a)
the day on which the transfer occurs, and
(b)
the need to ensure that no amount is payable in respect of both courses for the same period.Effect of transfer – grants and maintenance loans
30.—(1) This regulation applies where the Welsh Ministers transfer an eligible student's status under regulation 28 during an academic year.
(2) If regulation 31 applies to the transfer, the total amount of any grants and maintenance loan payable to the eligible student for the academic year must be reassessed in accordance with that regulation.
(3) If regulation 31 does not apply to the transfer—
(a)
the Welsh Ministers may re-assess the amount of any grants and maintenance loan payable to the eligible student for the academic year, but
(b)
if no re-assessment is made, the total amount of any grants and maintenance loan payable to the eligible student is the amount which the Welsh Ministers assessed as the amount payable to the student for the academic year in respect of the old course.
(4) Paragraph (5) applies where the transfer occurs after the Welsh Ministers have assessed the amount of any grants or maintenance loan payable to the eligible student for the academic year in respect of the old course but before the student completes that year.
(5) Where this paragraph applies, the eligible student may not apply in respect of the academic year of the new course for another grant or loan of a kind for which the student has already applied in respect of the academic year of the old course (unless specifically permitted to do so by these Regulations).
(6) Where, immediately before the transfer, the eligible student—
(a)
was eligible to apply for a maintenance loan for the academic year of the old course, and
(b)
had not applied for the maximum amount for which the student was entitled,
paragraph (5) does not prevent the student from applying for an additional amount of loan (whether or not a reassessment is made under this regulation or regulation 31).
(7) Where an eligible student has applied for a disabled student's grant for the academic year in which the transfer occurs, paragraph (5) does not prevent the student from making a further such application—
(a)
for a purpose for which the student has not already applied, or
(b)
for an additional amount in respect of a purpose for the which the student has already applied.Transfers involving conversions between part-time and full-time study
31.—(1) This regulation applies where, in relation to a transfer under regulation 28—
(a)
the old course is a full-time course and the new course is a part-time course, or
(b)
the old course is a part-time course and the new course is a full-time course.
(2) Where this regulation applies, the total amount of any grants and maintenance loan payable to the eligible student for the academic year is to be reassessed by the Welsh Ministers as follows—
Step 1
Calculate, in accordance with Parts 7 to 11, the amounts of any grants and maintenance loan that would have been payable in respect of—
(a)
the old course, and
(b)
the new course,
for the whole academic year.
Step 2
Reduce those amounts by multiplying them by the appropriate fraction.
The total of the two amounts arrived at under Step 2 is the total amount of grants and maintenance loan payable to the student for the academic year during which the transfer occurs.
(3) In Step 2 of paragraph (2), the appropriate fraction in relation to the old course is the fraction where—
(a)
the numerator is the number of days in the academic year up to and including the day on which the transfer occurs, and
(b)
the denominator is the total number of days in the academic year.
(4) In Step 2 of paragraph (2), the appropriate fraction in relation to the new course is the fraction where—
(a)
the numerator is the number of days remaining in the academic year after the day on which the transfer occurs, and
(b)
the denominator is the total number of days in the academic year.
(5) For the avoidance of doubt, where the start date of the academic year of the new course is later than the start date of the academic year of the old course, references in paragraph (4) to the academic year are to the academic year of the new course.Requirement to apply for support
32.—(1) A person does not qualify for support as an eligible student in relation to an academic year unless the person makes an application for that support in relation to the academic year.
(2) An application under paragraph (1) must—
(a)

(b)
be accompanied by such documentation as the Welsh Ministers may require, and
(c)
reach the Welsh Ministers within the time limit specified in regulation 33.Time limit for making application

(c)
P receives notification from the Welsh Ministers under regulation 34(5) incorrectly stating that P is an eligible student.

77.—(1) The amount of GfD payable to an eligible student in respect of an academic year is calculated by applying the following steps— Step 1 Aggregate—
(a)
the eligible student's household income calculated under Part 2 of Schedule 3,
(b)
if not already taken into account as part of the eligible student's household income, the residual income of the eligible student's adult dependant for the applicable financial year calculated under Chapter 2 of Part 4 of Schedule 3, and
(c)
the net income of the eligible student's dependent children for the applicable financial year calculated under Part 5 of Schedule 3.
Step 2 Deduct the following amounts from the aggregated total calculated under Step 1—
(a)
[F1£6,332], where the eligible student has no dependent children;
(b)
[F2£8,711], where the eligible student is not a lone parent and has one dependent child;
(c)
[F3£9,902], where the eligible student—
(i)
is not a lone parent and has more than one dependent child, or
(ii)
is a lone parent and has one dependent child;
(d)
[F4£11,100], where the eligible student is a lone parent and has more than one dependent child.
The result is the net total. Step 3 Add up the maximum amounts of each GfD for which the eligible student qualifies. The result is the aggregated maximums. Step 4
(a)
If the net total under Step 2 is nil or a negative amount, the amount payable is—
(i)
where the present course is a full-time course, the aggregated maximums arrived at under Step 3;
(ii)
where the present course is a part-time course, the aggregated maximums arrived at under Step 3 reduced in accordance with paragraph (2).
(b)
If the net total under Step 2 is equal to or exceeds the aggregated maximums arrived at under Step 3, the amount payable is nil.
(c)
If the net total under Step 2 is a positive amount which is less than the aggregated maximums arrived at under Step 3, deduct the net total from the aggregated maximums so as to reduce the amount of GfDs payable in the following order until the net total is extinguished—
(i)
first deduct the maximum amount of adult dependants grant for which the eligible student qualifies;
(ii)
then deduct the maximum amount of childcare grant for which the student qualifies;
(iii)
finally deduct the maximum amount of parents' learning grant for which the student qualifies.
(d)
Where sub-paragraph (c) of this Step applies, the amount remaining after that reduction is—
(i)
the amount payable where the present course is a full-time course;
(ii)
the amount to be reduced in accordance with paragraph (2) where the present course is a part-time course.
[F5(2) If the eligible student’s present course is a part-time course, the amount of GfD payable is the amount referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) or (d)(ii) of Step 4 of paragraph (1) multiplied by—
(a)
25%, where the intensity of study for the current academic year is at least 25% but less than 30%;
(b)
30%, where the intensity of study for the current academic year is at least 30% but less than 40%;
(c)
40%, where the intensity of study for the current academic year is at least 40% but less than 50%;
(d)
50%, where the intensity of study for the current academic year is at least 50% but less than 60%;
(e)
60%, where the intensity of study for the current academic year is at least 60% but less than 75%;
(f)
75%, where the intensity of study for the current academic year is 75% or more.]
(3) Where the amount of GfD payable as a result of Step 4 of paragraph (1) or, as the case may be, paragraph (2), is an amount of parents' learning grant which is more than £0.01 but less than £50, the amount payable is £50.
(4) This regulation is subject to regulations 78 and 79.

2.  This Part makes provision about the calculation of an eligible student's household income.
Calculation of household income
3.—(1) An eligible student's household income is calculated by applying the following steps— Step 1 If the student is not an independent eligible student (see paragraph 4), aggregate the total residual income of the persons listed in List A. If the student is an independent eligible student, aggregate the total residual income of the persons listed in List B.
List A
The persons are—
(a)
the eligible student, plus
(b)
either—
(i)
each of the eligible student's parents (subject to paragraph 5), or
(ii)
where the student's parents have separated, the parent selected under paragraph 6(3) and that parent's partner (if that parent has one), (subject to paragraph 7).
List B
The persons are—
(a)
the independent eligible student, plus
(b)
the student's partner (if the student has one), (subject to paragraphs 7 and 8).
Step 2 Calculate the applicable amount of dependent child deduction (see sub-paragraphs (2) to (4)) and deduct that from the aggregated total calculated under Step 1. The result is the eligible student's household income.
(2) A dependent child deduction is a deduction made in respect of each child wholly or mainly financially dependent on—
(a)
the eligible student,
(b)
the eligible student's partner,

(b)
the partner of the eligible student's parent,
if the child is the eligible student.

Period of eligibility
5.—(1) An Oxbridge college fee loan is available in respect of each standard academic year of the designated Oxbridge course and in respect of one academic year of the course that is not a standard academic year.
(2) Where an eligible Oxbridge student is allowed to study the content of one standard academic year of the designated Oxbridge course over two or more academic years, for the purpose of determining whether the student qualifies for an Oxbridge college fee loan for those years, the first of such years of study is to be treated as a standard academic year and the following years of that kind are to be treated as academic years that are not standard academic years.
(3) In this paragraph, “standard academic year” means an academic year of the designated Oxbridge course that would be undertaken by a person who does not repeat any part of the course and who enters the course at the same point as the eligible Oxbridge student.
Amount of the college fee loan
6.—(1) The amount of an Oxbridge college fee loan in respect of an academic year of a designated Oxbridge course must not exceed the amount equal to the college fees payable by the eligible Oxbridge student to the student's college or permanent private hall in connection with that year.
(2) Where an eligible Oxbridge student has applied for an Oxbridge college fee loan of less than the maximum amount available in relation to the academic year, the student may apply to borrow an additional amount which, when added to the amount already applied for, does not exceed the maximum amount available.
Transfers
7.—(1) Where an eligible Oxbridge student transfers from one designated Oxbridge course to another, the Welsh Ministers must transfer the student's status as an eligible Oxbridge student to the other course if—
(a)
they receive a request from the student to do so, and
(b)
the student's period of eligibility has not ended or been terminated.
(2) If the eligible Oxbridge student transfers before the end of the academic year but after applying for an Oxbridge college fee loan, the amount applied for is to be paid to the relevant college or permanent private hall in respect of the designated Oxbridge course to which the student transfers (unless sub-paragraph (4) applies).
(3) Where sub-paragraph (2) applies, the eligible Oxbridge student may not apply for another Oxbridge college fee loan in respect of that academic year.
(4) If an eligible Oxbridge student transfers after the Oxbridge college fee loan is paid and before the end of the academic year, the student cannot apply for another Oxbridge college fee loan in connection with the academic year of the designated Oxbridge course to which the student transfers.
Payment
8.—(1) The Welsh Ministers must pay an Oxbridge college fee loan for which an eligible Oxbridge student qualifies to the college or permanent private hall to which the student is liable to make payment.
(2) The loan must be paid in a single lump sum.
(3) The Welsh Ministers may not pay the loan before—
(a)
they have received from the college or permanent private hall—
(i)
a request for payment in writing, and
(ii)
an attendance confirmation in such form as the Welsh Ministers may specify, and
(b)
the period of three months beginning with the first day of the academic year to which the loan relates has expired.
(4) The Welsh Ministers may pay an Oxbridge college fee loan without receiving an attendance confirmation if they think that owing to exceptional circumstances it would be appropriate to do so.
(5) In this paragraph, “attendance confirmation” means a confirmation such as is referred to in regulation 87(1).
(6) The Welsh Ministers must not make a payment of an Oxbridge college fee loan in respect of an academic year of a designated Oxbridge course if—
(a)
the eligible Oxbridge student ceases to undertake the course before the expiry of the period of three months beginning with the first day of the academic year, and
(b)
the college or permanent private hall has determined or agreed that the student will not commence undertaking the course in the United Kingdom again during the academic year.
(7) Paragraphs 9 and 10 set out other circumstances in which payment of an Oxbridge college fee loan may not be made or may be withheld.
Requirement to provide national insurance number
9.—(1) The Welsh Ministers may make it a condition of entitlement to payment of an Oxbridge college fee loan that an eligible Oxbridge student must provide them with the student's United Kingdom national insurance number.
(2) If that condition is imposed, the Welsh Ministers may not make any payment of the loan until the eligible Oxbridge student has complied with it, unless the Welsh Ministers are satisfied that, owing to exceptional circumstances, it would be appropriate to make a payment despite the condition not being complied with.
Information requirements and agreements for repayment
10.—(1) The Welsh Ministers may at any time request from an eligible Oxbridge student such information or documentation as they may require for the purposes of—
(a)
determining eligibility for an Oxbridge college fee loan, or
(b)
recovering a loan.
(2) A request under sub-paragraph (1) may include requesting sight of an eligible Oxbridge student's—
(a)
valid passport issued by the state of which that student is a national,
(b)
valid national identity card, or
(c)
birth certificate.
(3) Where the Welsh Ministers have requested information or documentation under sub-paragraph (1), they may withhold any payment of an Oxbridge college fee loan until the student provides what has been requested or provides a satisfactory explanation for not complying with the request.
(4) The Welsh Ministers may at any time require an eligible Oxbridge student to enter into an agreement to repay an Oxbridge college fee loan by a particular method.
(5) Where the Welsh Ministers have requested an agreement as to the method of repayment, they may withhold any payment of an Oxbridge college fee loan until the student provides what has been requested.
Overpayment
11.  Any overpayment of an Oxbridge college fee loan is recoverable by the Welsh Ministers from the college or permanent private hall.(Regulation 25(2))

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for financial support for students taking designated higher education courses which begin on or after 1 August 2018. They also provide support for courses which begin before that date and are subsequently converted from full-time to part-time or part-time to full-time on or after 1 August 2018.
The Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (“2017 Regulations”) remain in force as amended by regulation 100 of, and Schedule 6 to, these Regulations. The 2017 Regulations apply to the provision of support to students who continue on courses they started on or after 1 September 2017 and before 1 August 2018. The 2017 Regulations also apply to end-on courses (within the meaning of those Regulations) and in relation to courses where a student's status has transferred under regulation 8, 75, 102, 114 of, or paragraph 11 of Schedule 4 to, the 2017 Regulations, whether that transfer occurs before, on or after 1 August 2018.
To qualify for support under these Regulations a student must be an “eligible student”. To be an eligible student, a person must satisfy the eligibility provisions in Part 4 (Chapter 2, Section 1) and any other eligibility requirements elsewhere in the Regulations. An eligible student must also satisfy the specific requirements applicable to each type of financial support.
To be an eligible student, a person must fall within one of the categories set out in Schedule 2. The majority of categories in Schedule 2 require the student to be ordinarily resident in Wales (other than categories 4(1)(a)(iv) – (vi) and category 6(1)). For the purposes of these Regulations a person who is ordinarily resident in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man as a result of having moved from one of those areas for the purpose of undertaking a designated course is considered ordinarily resident in the place from which that person moved (Schedule 2, paragraph 9(1)).
The period for which a student is eligible to receive support under these Regulations is determined in accordance with regulations 12 to 23. Regulations 24 to 27 restrict the availability of support where a student has undertaken certain previous study. In certain circumstances an eligible student may transfer from one designated course to another, including from a full-time course to a part-time course and vice-versa (regulations 28 to 31).
Support is only available under these Regulations in respect of “designated” courses within the meaning of regulations 5 and 8. Support is provided to eligible students undertaking a designated course wherever they study in the United Kingdom.
These Regulations provide a core set of rules for the provision of support to eligible students whether they study full-time, part-time, sandwich courses or distance learning courses. Any differences in treatment between those courses are prescribed in the relevant regulations. Eligible students undertaking part-time courses will not be eligible for support under these Regulations in respect of an academic year where their intensity of study for that year is less than 25% (regulation 13). Schedule 1 of these Regulations makes provision about the interpretation of certain key terms and paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 sets out how “intensity of study” is to be calculated.
Part 5 of these Regulations makes provision for applications for support (regulation 32), time limits for applications (regulation 33) and regulation 34 permits the Welsh Ministers to make such inquiries as they think necessary to make a decision on an application and to notify an applicant of a decision. This Part imposes obligations on eligible students to provide the Welsh Ministers with information (regulation 35), to enter into a contract for a loan (regulation 36) and an obligation on academic authorities to inform the Welsh Ministers when a student has ceased to undertake a course (regulation 37).
Support under these Regulations is available in the form of the following grants and loans-
a
tuition fee loan (Part 6);
b
base grant and maintenance grant (Part 7);
c
maintenance loan (Part 8);
d
disabled student's grant (Part 9);
e
grants for travel (Part 10);
f
grants for dependants (Part 11);
g
disabled postgraduate student's grant (Part 15);
h
Oxbridge college fee loans (Part 16).
In order to qualify for a tuition fee loan, base grant, maintenance grant, maintenance loan, disabled student's grant, grant for travel, or grants for dependants, an eligible student must meet the qualifying conditions for those types of support. In order to be eligible for support eligible students who wish to undertake a distance learning course must, in addition to satisfying the qualifying conditions, be in Wales on the first day of the first academic year of the course. This requirement does not apply to students who are not in Wales on the first day of the first academic year of the course because they, or their close relative, is serving as a member of the regular navy, military or air forces of the Crown outside Wales. Eligible students undertaking distance learning courses are not eligible for grants for travel, grants for dependants or Oxbridge college fee loans (subject to the exception in paragraph 3(4) of Schedule 5).
Fee grants payable under the 2017 Regulations are not available under these Regulations and are replaced with tuition fee loans which are payable in accordance with Part 6. Part 7 provides for the payment of a new base grant and a maintenance grant. The base grant is a payment of £1,000 for eligible students undertaking full-time courses and for eligible students undertaking part-time courses it is £1,000 multiplied by the intensity of their study.
The amount of maintenance grant payable to full-time students is determined by reference to the student's living arrangements, their household income and whether they are a care leaver (regulation 46). The amount of maintenance grant payable to part-time students is determined by reference to the student's household income, whether they are a care leaver and the intensity of their study (regulation 47). An eligible student's household income is calculated in accordance with Part 2 of Schedule 3. “Care leaver” for these purposes is defined in regulation 49.
Chapter 4 of Part 7 of these Regulations provides for a special support payment to be made to an eligible student who meets one of the qualifying conditions in regulation 51 and who qualifies for a base grant or maintenance grant. A special support payment is intended to meet the cost of books and equipment, travel expenses and childcare costs incurred by an eligible student in undertaking a designated course.
Maintenance loans are payable to eligible students in accordance with Part 8 of these Regulations. An eligible student will qualify for a maintenance loan unless one of the exceptions in regulation 54 applies to the student. The amount of maintenance loan available is calculated in accordance with regulations 55 to 57 for full-time students and regulation 58 for part-time students.
Part 9 of these Regulations makes provision in respect of grants for disabled students. The qualifying conditions for such grants are set out in regulation 62. The amount of grant available to disabled students is the amount that the Welsh Ministers think appropriate not exceeding the aggregate amount of the limits applicable in respect of the Cases listed in regulation 63(2).
Part 10 of these Regulations makes provision in respect of grants for travel; including grants for travel for medical students (regulation 65) and for study or work overseas (regulation 66).
Part 11 makes provision for grants to eligible students in respect of the costs associated with certain dependants. Three grants are available; an adult dependants grant (Chapter 2), a parents' learning grant (Chapter 3) and childcare grant (Chapter 4). In order to qualify for a grant an eligible student must meet the specified qualifying conditions for that grant and the qualifying conditions in regulation 69.
Part 12 makes provision for students who qualify for certain types of support part way through an academic year. Where a student qualifies for a grant or maintenance loan during the course of an academic year, such support is payable only in respect of the academic quarters following the event which triggers their eligibility. A maintenance loan will only be payable if it is a quarter in respect of which the loan would otherwise be payable under regulation 85(6) and (7).
Part 13 of these Regulations makes provision in respect of payments, overpayments and recovery of payments.
Regulations 93 to 95 make provision for support payable under these Regulations to be reduced in certain circumstances; including where an eligible student becomes a prisoner, stops undertaking the present course for any period, or where their eligibility has ended or has been terminated, during an academic year.
Schedule 3 concerns the calculation of income. Part 2 of Schedule 3 provides for the way in which an eligible student's household income will be calculated for the purposes of determining the amount of maintenance grant, grant for travel and grants for dependants which may be payable to the eligible student. In order to calculate household income it is necessary to calculate the taxable income and residual income of each person in the household. Part 3 of Schedule 3 sets out the meaning of taxable income for these purposes. Part 4 of Schedule 3 makes provision about the calculation of a person's residual income. Part 5 of Schedule 3 makes provision about the calculation of net income for the purposes of determining whether an eligible student qualifies for an adult dependants grant and for the purposes of calculating the amount of grant for dependants payable to the student.
Part 15 and Schedule 4 make provision for support for postgraduate students with disabilities.
Part 16 and Schedule 5 make provision for “Oxbridge college fee loans”. These are loans in respect of the college fees payable by eligible Oxbridge students (as defined in paragraph 3 of Schedule 5) to a college or permanent private hall of the University of Oxford, or a college of the University of Cambridge, in connection with their attendance on a designated Oxbridge course (as defined in paragraph 2 of Schedule 5).
Part 17 and Schedule 6 contains amendments to the 2017 Regulations.
Schedule 7 is the final schedule to these Regulations and contains the index of defined terms.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

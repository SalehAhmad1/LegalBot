FOOD, WALES
The Condensed Milk and Dried Milk (Wales) Regulations 2018
Made
27 February 2018
Laid before the National Assembly for Wales
5 March 2018
Coming into force
26 March 2018
The Welsh Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 6(4), 16(1)(e), 17(1) and (2), 26(1) and (3) and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990(1) and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to the European Communities Act 1972(2).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Welsh Ministers that it is expedient for references to the European instruments, and the Annex to the European instrument, listed in regulation 2(4) to be construed as references to those instruments and that Annex as amended from time to time.
So far as these Regulations are made in exercise of powers under the Food Safety Act 1990, the Welsh Ministers have had regard to relevant advice given by the Food Standards Agency in accordance with section 48(4A)(3) of that Act.
There has been open and transparent public consultation during the preparation and evaluation of these Regulations as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(4).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in relation to Wales, revoke and replace the Condensed Milk and Dried Milk (Wales) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/3053 (W. 291)) and revoke the Condensed Milk and Dried Milk (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/137 (W. 19)). They transpose Council Directive 2001/114/EC relating to certain partly or wholly dehydrated preserved milk for human consumption (OJ No L 15, 17.1.02, p 19).
Regulation 2 and Schedules 1 and 2 define condensed milk and dried milk products and the reserved descriptions that apply to them.
Regulation 3 prohibits the labelling with reserved descriptions of food other than the designated condensed and dried milk products to which they relate.
Regulation 4 sets out the labelling requirements for designated condensed and dried milk products.
Regulation 5 sets out the manner of marking or labelling the designated condensed and dried milk products with the particulars required by regulation 4. The marking and labelling requirements are in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers (OJ No L 304, 22.11.11, p 18).
Regulation 6 and Schedule 3 apply certain provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 (1990 c. 16) with modifications. This includes the application of section 10(1) (with modifications) and (2), enabling an improvement notice to be served to require compliance with regulations 3, 4 and 5. The provisions, as applied, make the failure to comply with an improvement notice an offence under section 10(2).
Regulation 7 imposes an obligation on food authorities to enforce these Regulations.
Regulation 8 revokes previous Regulations, as set out above.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

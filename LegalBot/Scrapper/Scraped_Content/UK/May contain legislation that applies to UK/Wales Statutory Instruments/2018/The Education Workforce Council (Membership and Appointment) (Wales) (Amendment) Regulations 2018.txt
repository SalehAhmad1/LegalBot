17 July 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2 of the Education (Wales) Act 2014 (“the 2014 Act”) confers functions on the Education Workforce Council (“the Council”) in relation to persons who are required to register in the register the Council maintains in accordance with section 9 of that Act (“Registered Persons”). The categories of Registered Persons are set out in Table 1 at paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 to the 2014 Act.
Schedule 1 to the 2014 Act provides that the Council will have 14 members appointed by the Welsh Ministers. Seven of those members must be appointed from nominees of organisations set out in Regulations (“Nominating Bodies”). The list of Nominating Bodies is set out in Schedule 2 to the Education Workforce Council (Membership and Appointment) (Wales) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”).
These Regulations amend Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations so as to omit paragraph 1 (entry for the National Union of Teachers (Cymru)) and paragraph 7 (entry for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers). Those Unions have now merged to create a new union called the National Education Union. Therefore, to reflect that merger the National Education Union is added to the list of bodies set out in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations (regulation 2(a)).
The categories of Registered Persons were amended by the Education Workforce Council (Registration of Youth Workers, Youth Support Workers and Work Based Learning Practitioners) Order 2016 so as to include youth workers, youth support workers, and work based learner practitioners (“New Categories”).
These Regulations amend Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations so as to allow bodies that represent the New Categories of Registered Persons to nominate persons to become members of the Council. Accordingly these Regulations add to the list of Nominating Bodies the following (regulation 2(b))—
(a)
Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services Cyngor Cymreig y Gwasanaethau Ieuenctid Gwirfoddol;
(b)
Wales Principal Youth Officers’ Group;
(c)
National Training Federation for Wales Ltd; and
(d)
Education Training Standards Wales.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

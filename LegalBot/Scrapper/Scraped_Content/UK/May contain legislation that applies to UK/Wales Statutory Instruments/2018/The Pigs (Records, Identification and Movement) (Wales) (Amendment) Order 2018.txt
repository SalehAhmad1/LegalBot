22 May 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, which applies in relation to Wales, amends the Pigs (Records, Identification and Movement) (Wales) Order 2011 (S.I. 2011/2830) (W. 303).
It removes the definitions of MLCSL (Meat and Livestock Commercial Services Limited) and BPEX (in effect the British Pig Executive) from article 2 and inserts a new definition of AHDB (Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board). All subsequent references to MLCSL and BPEX are replaced by AHDB.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order as the amendments are technical in nature.

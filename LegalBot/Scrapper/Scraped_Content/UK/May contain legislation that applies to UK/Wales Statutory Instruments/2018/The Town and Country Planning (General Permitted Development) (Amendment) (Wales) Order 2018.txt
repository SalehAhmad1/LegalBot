2 May 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (S.I. 1995/418) (“the GPDO”) in relation to Wales.
Article 3 of and Schedule 2 to the GPDO confer permitted development rights in respect of certain development. Where such rights are conferred, an application for planning permission is not required.
Class A of Part 24 of Schedule 2 to the GPDO permits certain development by electronic communications code operators provided it does not fall within A.1 (development not permitted) and subject to any relevant conditions and limitations in A.2 and A.3.
Paragraph A.2(4A) sets out conditions in relation to the construction, installation or replacement of telegraph poles, cabinets or lines for fixed line broadband services in relation to categories of land identified in article 1(5) of and Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the GPDO. If all the relevant conditions are satisfied, such development does not require prior approval under paragraph A.3. One of those conditions is that the development must be completed on or before 30 May 2018.
Article 2 of this Order extends that date to 30 May 2019.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this Order as no impact is foreseen on business, charities or the public sector beyond the nature of what was examined in the impact assessment that accompanied the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Amendment) (Wales) (No. 2) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/2692 (W. 267)), which inserted paragraph A.2(4A) into Part 24. Copies of that assessment can be obtained from the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ and on the Welsh Government website at www.gov.wales.

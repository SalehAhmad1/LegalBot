(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for a maximum total amount for the net Welsh emissions account (a carbon budget) for the first two budgetary periods, 2016-2020 and 2021- 2025, provided for in section 31(3) of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016.
The purpose of Part 2 of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 is to require the Welsh Ministers to meet targets for reducing net Welsh emissions of greenhouse gases from Wales. Section 29 places a duty upon the Welsh Ministers to ensure that net Welsh emissions for the year 2050 are at least 80% lower than the 1990 baseline emissions figures.
Section 31(1) provides that the Welsh Ministers set carbon budgets for each 5 year budgetary period between 2016 and 2050. Section 32(2) requires that each carbon budget set by the Welsh Ministers is set at a level consistent with meeting the 2050 Target.
Regulation 2 provides that the carbon budget for the budgetary period 2016-2020 is limited to an average of 23% lower than the baseline and that the budgetary period for 2021-2025 is limited to an average of 33% lower than the baseline.
In accordance with section 49 of the Act, the Welsh Ministers have obtained and taken into account the advice of the advisory body before laying draft regulations.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

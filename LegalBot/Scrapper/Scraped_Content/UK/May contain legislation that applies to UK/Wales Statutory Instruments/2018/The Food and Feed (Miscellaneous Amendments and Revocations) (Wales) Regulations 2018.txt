Coming into force
26 July 2018
The Welsh Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred on them by—
(a)
except regulations 4, 26 and 29, to the extent that regulation 29 as read with Schedule 3 revokes the Beef Bones (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 1999 and the Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) (Butchers' Shops) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2000, section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”) M1;
(b)
in relation to regulations 8(4)(b), 11(6)(a), 13(2), 21 and 26, paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to the 1972 Act M2;
(c)
in relation to regulations 4, 26 and 29, to the extent that regulation 29 as read with Schedule 3 revokes the Beef Bones (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 1999 and the Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) (Butchers' Shops) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2000, sections 16(1)(a) and 48(1)(c) of the Food Safety Act 1990 M3.
The Welsh Ministers have been designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the 1972 Act in relation to—
(a)
the control and regulation of the deliberate release, placing on the market and transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms M4;
(b)

(c)
measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields for the protection of public health M6;
(d)
measures in relation to the common agricultural policy of the European Union M7.
As set out above, these Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the 1972 Act and it appears to the Welsh Ministers that it is expedient for particular references to the specified Annexes to the following EU instruments to be construed as references to those Annexes as amended from time to time—
(a)
Annex I or II to Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods M8;
(b)
the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives M9;
(c)
Annex I to Directive 2009/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on extraction solvents used in the production of foodstuffs and food ingredients (Recast) M10;
(d)
Annex I to Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food M11;
(e)
the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 579/2014 M12.
So far as these Regulations are made in exercise of powers under the Food Safety Act 1990, in accordance with section 48(4A) M13 of the Food Safety Act 1990, the Welsh Ministers have had regard to relevant advice given by the Food Standards Agency before making these Regulations.
There has been open and transparent public consultation during the preparation and evaluation of these Regulations as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety M14.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments in relation to Wales to a number of pieces of secondary legislation relating to food and feed.
Regulation 11 amends the Food Hygiene (Wales) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/32 (W. 5)) to amend the definition of Regulation (EC) 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (OJ No L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 1) so as to require that Regulation to be read with new Commission Regulation (EU) No 2017/2158 establishing mitigation measures and benchmark levels for the reduction of the presence of acrylamide in food (OJ No L 304, 21.11.2017, p. 24).
Regulation 25 amends the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (Wales) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/2750 (W. 267)) to implement Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1040/2014 amending Council Directive 2001/112/EC relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption to adapt its Annex I to technical progress (OJ No L 288, 2.10.2014, p. 1). This allows plant proteins from wheat, peas and potatoes to be used for the clarification of products to which the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (Wales) Regulations 2013 apply.
These Regulations make other miscellaneous minor amendments to legislation relating to food and feed, in particular amending out of date references to domestic legislation and to EU instruments.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

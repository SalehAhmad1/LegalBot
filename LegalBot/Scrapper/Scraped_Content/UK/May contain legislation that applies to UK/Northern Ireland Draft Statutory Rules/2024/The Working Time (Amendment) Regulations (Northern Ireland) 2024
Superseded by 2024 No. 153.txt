Minister for the EconomyEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
These Regulations amend the Working Time Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 to include express provision about the rights of workers, in certain circumstances, to carry forward annual leave into subsequent leave years and the calculation of holiday pay in relation to those rights.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these regulations as the purpose of the regulations is to restate certain employment rights to ensure those rights continue to apply and provide legal certainty.

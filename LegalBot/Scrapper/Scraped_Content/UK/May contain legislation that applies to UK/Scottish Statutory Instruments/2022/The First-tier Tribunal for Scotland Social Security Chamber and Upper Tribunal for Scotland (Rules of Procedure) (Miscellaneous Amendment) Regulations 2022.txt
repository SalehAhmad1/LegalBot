10th May 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Social Security Chamber (Procedure) Regulations 2018 (“the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Social Security Chamber Regulations”) and Upper Tribunal for Scotland (Social Security Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2018 (“the Upper Tribunal Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends rule 14 (disclosure of documents and information) in the schedule of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Social Security Chamber Regulations. The amendments enable the First-tier Tribunal on its own initiative, or on application by one or more of the parties, to give a direction prohibiting disclosure of a document or information to the recipient or some other person if it will cause serious harm to their physical or mental health. The amendments also enable the First-tier Tribunal to give a direction allowing for disclosure of documents or information to a party’s representative, or any other person acting on their behalf, where a direction has been given which prevents disclosure of documents or information to the party. A direction given by the First-tier Tribunal will apply only to proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal.
Regulation 3 amends rule 17 (disclosure of documents and information) in the schedule of the Upper Tribunal Regulations to make equivalent provision for the Upper Tribunal.

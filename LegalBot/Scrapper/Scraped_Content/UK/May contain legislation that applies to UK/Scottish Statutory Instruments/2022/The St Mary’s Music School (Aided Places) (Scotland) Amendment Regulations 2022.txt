These Regulations amend the St Mary’s Music School (Aided Places) (Scotland) Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”). These Regulations come into force on 1 August 2022.
The 2015 Regulations provide for the payment of allowances to St Mary’s Music School, Edinburgh, to reimburse it for its expenditure in respect of fees and charges remitted and grants made in operating the aided places scheme described in schedule 1 of those Regulations.
Regulation 2(2) amends the residence criteria for eligibility for the aided places scheme in paragraph 2 of Part 1 of schedule 1 of the 2015 Regulations.
Regulation 2(2)(a) amends paragraph 2 to substitute a new criterion for EEA nationals to ensure that EEA nationals who have been resident in the British Islands since before IP completion day (as defined in section 39 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) remain eligible under that paragraph. It inserts a criterion for the children of such EEA nationals who are resident in the British Islands on the relevant date.
Regulation 2(2)(a) also inserts a new criterion for applicants who have applied to one of several schemes operated by the United Kingdom Home Office which are related to the conflict in Ukraine and who are either waiting for their application to be considered or who have been granted leave to enter or remain following such an application.

Regulation 2(4) amends the income threshold below which no parental contribution is payable in respect of fees for boarders and amends the table that sets out parental contribution levels for boarders by income band. Regulation 2(5) does the same in respect of fees for day pupils.
Regulation 2(6)(a) amends the parental income threshold below which an aided pupil is entitled to a clothing grant in the pupil’s first year at the school, and substitutes a new table setting out the maximum amount of clothing grant payable by income band. Regulation 2(6)(b) does the same for any subsequent year of an aided pupil at the school.

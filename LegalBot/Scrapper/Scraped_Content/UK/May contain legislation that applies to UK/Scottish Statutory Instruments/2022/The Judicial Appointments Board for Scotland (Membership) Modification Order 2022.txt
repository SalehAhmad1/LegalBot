7th September 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order modifies the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 (“the 2008 Act”).
Article 2(2)(a) increases the number of members of the Judicial Appointments Board for Scotland (“the Board”) who are judges of the Court of Session from one to two. Article 2(2)(c) provides for an additional legal member of the Board, who may be either a solicitor or an advocate.
In accordance with paragraph 4 of schedule 1 of the 2008 Act, the number of lay members of the board is to be equal to the total number of judicial and legal members. This Order therefore has the additional effect of increasing the required number of lay members by two persons.

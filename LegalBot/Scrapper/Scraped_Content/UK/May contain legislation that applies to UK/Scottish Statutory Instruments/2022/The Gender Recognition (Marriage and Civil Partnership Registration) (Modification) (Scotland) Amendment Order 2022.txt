(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Gender Recognition (Marriage and Civil Partnership Registration) (Modification) (Scotland) Order 2016 (“the 2016 Order”). The 2016 Order modifies the operation of the law concerning the registration of marriages and civil partnerships where a new entry is made in the register of marriages or the civil partnership register in accordance with the Gender Recognition (Marriage and Civil Partnership Registration) (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”). Such an entry may be made when a full Gender Recognition Certificate has been issued to a party, or to both parties, to a marriage or civil partnership, so the information on the register does not identify them as having obtained a gender recognition certificate.
In consequence of amendments to the 2016 Regulations, a new civil partnership register entry may show a civil partnership as having been registered on a date other than that shown on the existing entry. This Order amends the 2016 Order so that, in cases in which a new entry has been made in the civil partnership register, an extract of the entry is only sufficient evidence of the date of registration where the dates shown on the existing entry and the new entry are the same.

These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Scotland) Regulations 1989 (“the 1989 Regulations”), which provide for the making and recovery of charges for relevant services provided under the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. Schedule 1 of the 1989 Regulations, as introduced by regulation 3 of the 1989 Regulations, contains a list of diseases for the treatment of which no charge is to be made.
Regulation 2 amends the 1989 Regulations to insert “Monkeypox” and “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)” into schedule 1 and remove “Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)” which is a name no longer used from that schedule. A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

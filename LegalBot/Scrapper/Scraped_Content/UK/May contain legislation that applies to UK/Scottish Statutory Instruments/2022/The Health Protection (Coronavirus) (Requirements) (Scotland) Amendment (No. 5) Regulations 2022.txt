These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Requirements) (Scotland) Regulations 2021 (“the Principal Regulations”). These Regulations come into force on 28 February 2022.
The effect of these Regulations is to remove the requirement in the Principal Regulations for persons responsible for certain premises to have a reasonable system for checking that a person on the premises has been fully vaccinated, has received appropriate test results, or is otherwise exempt. Regulation 2(2) also removes the requirement to treat information as confidential (regulation 7B), the requirement for persons responsible for certain premises to prepare and maintain a compliance plan (regulation 7C), supplemental provisions in relation to licensing (regulation 7D), and regulation 7E (interpretation of regulations 7A to 7D).
Regulation 2(3) makes a consequential amendment to regulation 15(9) of the Principal Regulations.

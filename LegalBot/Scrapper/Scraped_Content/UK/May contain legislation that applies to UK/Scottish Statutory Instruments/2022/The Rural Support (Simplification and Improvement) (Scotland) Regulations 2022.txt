(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 352/78, (EC) No 165/94, (EC) No 2799/98, (EC) No 814/2000, (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 485/2008 (“the Horizontal Regulation”) and the Rural Support (Controls) (Coronavirus) (Scotland) Regulations 2022.
Regulation 2 simplifies and improves the retained EU law relating to the operation of rural support schemes by amending the Horizontal Regulation to allow Scottish Ministers to begin making advance payments for direct payment schemes at a date in the calendar year earlier than 16 October.
Regulation 3 corrects a minor drafting error in the Rural Support (Controls) (Coronavirus) (Scotland) Regulations 2022.

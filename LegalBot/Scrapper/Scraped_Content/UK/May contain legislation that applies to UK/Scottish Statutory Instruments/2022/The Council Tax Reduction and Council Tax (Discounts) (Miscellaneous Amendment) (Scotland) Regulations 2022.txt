At 11.22 a.m. on 31st March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Council Tax (Discounts) (Scotland) Regulations 1992 (“the Discount Regulations”), the Council Tax Reduction (State Pension Credit) (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (“the Pension Age Regulations”) and the Council Tax Reduction (Scotland) Regulations 2021 (“the Working Age Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the Discount Regulations to add to the list of persons who are to be disregarded in working out entitlement to a discount from liability for council tax. The addition is any person who was residing in Ukraine immediately before 1 January 2022, left Ukraine in connection with the Russian invasion which took place on 24 February 2022 and who has either been granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, or has a right of abode in the United Kingdom.
Regulation 3 amends the definition of “non-dependant” in the Pension Age Regulations so that it does not cover any person who normally resides with a council tax reduction applicant and falls within the description set out above in relation to regulation 2. It also amends the Pension Age Regulations so that a payment made in acknowledgement of providing accommodation under the United Kingdom Government Homes for Ukraine scheme is not to be counted as capital in determining entitlement to council tax reduction.
Regulation 4 makes equivalent amendments to the Working Age Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Requirements) (Scotland) Regulations 2021 (“the Principal Regulations”). These Regulations come into force on 4 April 2022.
Regulation 2(2) removes regulation 5(1)(f) to (i) from the Principal Regulations. Regulation 5(1)(f) provided an exemption from the requirement to wear a face covering for a person in a place of worship and leading an act of worship in certain circumstances. Regulation 5(1)(g), (h) and (i) provided exemptions from the requirement to wear a face covering for a person at a funeral, commemorative event, marriage ceremony, or civil partnership registration if certain conditions were met. These provisions are being omitted in consequence of the amendments to regulation 6.
Regulation 2(3) amends regulation 6 of the Principal Regulations. The amendments in regulation 2(3)(a) and (c) together clarify that the requirement to wear a face covering does not apply to any indoor place listed in regulation 6(1) of the Principal Regulations which is used as a place of worship or, where a funeral, commemorative event for a deceased person, marriage ceremony, or civil partnership registration is taking place, for the duration of the funeral, event, ceremony or registration. The amendment in regulation 2(3)(b) removes the requirement to wear a face covering in indoor public places where a marriage ceremony or civil partnership registration is taking place and in places of worship.

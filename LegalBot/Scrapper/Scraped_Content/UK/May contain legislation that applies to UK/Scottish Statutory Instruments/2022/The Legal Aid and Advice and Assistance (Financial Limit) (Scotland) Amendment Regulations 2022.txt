(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend two sets of Regulations made under the Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 (“the 1986 Act”).
Regulation 2 amends the Criminal Legal Aid (Scotland) (Fees) Regulations 1989 to substitute the maximum total fees allowable to duty solicitors representing accused persons in the sheriff or district court where the accused person pleads not guilty or where the case is adjourned under section 145 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.
Regulation 3 amends the Advice and Assistance (Financial Limit) (Scotland) Regulations 1993 to substitute the financial limit amounts for advice and assistance specified in section 10(2) of the 1986 Act beyond which solicitors are required to seek prior approval of the Scottish Legal Aid Board before providing further advice and assistance.
A business and regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared in relation to these Regulations as no, or no significant impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

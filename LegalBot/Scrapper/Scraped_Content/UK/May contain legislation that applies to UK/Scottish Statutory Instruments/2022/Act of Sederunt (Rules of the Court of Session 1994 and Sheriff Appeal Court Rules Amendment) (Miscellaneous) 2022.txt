19th April 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)
This Act of Sederunt amends the Rules of the Court of Session 1994 as a consequence of the enactment of the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 (c.10). That Act amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (c.29) to insert sections 396DA and 396DB which make provision concerning the period for which an interim freezing order has effect.
This Act of Sederunt also makes court rule amendments to the Sheriff Appeal Court Rules 2021 and 2015 to correct a cross-referencing error in those Rules.

SCHEDULE 2EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations temporarily modify the Private Residential Tenancies (Prescribed Notices and Forms) (Scotland) Regulations 2017 and the Rent Regulation and Assured Tenancies (Forms) (Scotland) Regulations 2017 in response to emergency measures introduced by the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Act 2022, which comes into force on 28 October 2022 and is due to expire on 31 March 2023, unless amended.
Regulation 2 and schedule 1 modify the notice to leave form which is required to be issued to tenants under the Private Housing (Tenancies) (Scotland) Act 2016. The modified form includes additional, temporary grounds for eviction which were introduced by the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Act 2022.
Regulation 3 and schedule 2 modify Form AT6 which is required to be issued by a landlord who intends to raise proceedings for possession to a tenant of an assured tenancy under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988. The modified form includes additional, temporary grounds for eviction which were introduced by the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Act 2022.
These Regulations make changes to certain forms and notices in light of emergency measures introduced by the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Act 2022, which was subject to a Business Regulatory Impact Assessment. No further impact on business is foreseen as a result of these Regulations. A copy of all impact assessments for the Act can be obtained online at www.legislation.gov.uk.

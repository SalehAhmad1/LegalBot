(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/871). Those Regulations impose on producers obligations to recycle packaging waste in order to attain overall recycling and material-specific recycling targets.
These Regulations set an overall recycling target as well as material-specific recycling targets for 2023 on obligated producers in Scotland in relation to glass, plastic, aluminium, steel, paper/board and wood.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument (in combination with similar instruments in England and Wales) will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Producer Responsibility Unit at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Seacole Building, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.

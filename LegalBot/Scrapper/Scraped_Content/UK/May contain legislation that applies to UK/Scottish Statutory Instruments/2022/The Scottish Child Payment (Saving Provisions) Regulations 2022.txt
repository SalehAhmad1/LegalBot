(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make savings provisions in connection with the amendments made by the Social Security (Miscellaneous Amendment and Transitional Provision) (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (“the principal Regulations”) to the Scottish Child Payment Regulations 2020. These Regulations, together with the principal Regulations, come into force on 14 November 2022.
Regulation 4(6)(a) of the principal Regulations increases the value of Scottish Child Payment with effect from 14 November 2022. Regulation 2 of these Regulations makes saving provision so that the value of Scottish Child Payment that applied prior to that date continues to apply in respect of a period of entitlement on or after 1 April 2022 and before 14 November 2022.
Regulation 4(6)(b) of the principal Regulations increases the amount of Scottish Child Payment payable in the period of 12 weeks ending with the death of a child. Regulation 3 of these Regulations makes saving provision so that the change to entitlement effected by regulation 4(6)(b) of the principal Regulations does not apply where the child in question died before 14 November 2022.

These Regulations consolidate the Students’ Allowances (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (S.S.I. 2007/153), (“the Allowances Regulations”), the Nursing and Midwifery Student Allowances (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (S.S.I. 2007/151), (the Nursing and Midwifery Allowances Regulations”), the Education (Student Loans) (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (S.S.I. 2007/154), (“the Student Loans Regulations”), the Education (Student Loans for Tuition Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (S.S.I. 2006/333), (“the SLTF Regulations”), the Education Authority Bursaries (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (S.S.I. 2007/149) (“the Bursaries Regulations”) and the Education Maintenance Allowances (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (S.S.I. 2007/156) (“the EMA Regulations”).
In addition to minor and drafting alterations, these Regulations revoke and replace those six sets of regulations and make amendments to extend eligibility of student support to new categories of students.

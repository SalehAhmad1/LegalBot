(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Valuation Timetable (Scotland) Order 2022, which prescribes the dates on which, and periods within which, various things require to be done in relation to a valuation roll, including the making of a proposal for alteration of an entry in a valuation roll.
The timescales removed relate to the making of and dealing with proposals. They will now be provided for instead in the Valuation (Proposals Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (S.S.I. 2022/369), meaning that the procedures and timescales in relation to the making and disposal of proposals and the timescales for the making of appeals will be set out in the same instrument.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared in respect of the package of instruments of which the Valuation Timetable (Scotland) Order 2022 formed part. This Order does not affect the outcome of that assessment. Accordingly, no further assessment is required.

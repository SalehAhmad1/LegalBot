These Regulations amend (a) the National Health Service (Optical Charges and Payments) (Scotland) Regulations 1998 (“the 1998 Regulations”) which provide for payments to be made by means of a voucher system in respect of costs incurred by certain categories of persons in connection with the supply, replacement and repair of optical appliances and (b) the National Health Service (General Ophthalmic Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (“the 2006 Regulations”) on the provision of general ophthalmic services under the National Health Service in Scotland.
These Regulations amend the voucher values in the 1998 Regulations to—
a)
increase the redemption value of a voucher issued towards the cost of replacing a single contact lens, increase the maximum contribution by way of a voucher to the cost of repairing a frame and increase the maximum supplement for repair of small glasses and special frames (regulation 3),
b)
increase the value of vouchers issued towards the cost of supply and replacement of optical appliances (regulation 4),
c)
increase the value of vouchers issued towards the cost of repair of optical appliances (regulation 5), and
d)
increase the additional values for vouchers for prisms, tints, photochromic lenses and special categories of appliances (regulation 6).
These Regulations amend the 2006 Regulations to—
a)
remove references to “patient practice record form” and make consequential amendments (regulations 8, 10 and 11),
b)
amend regulation 12 to alter processes for removal from the Ophthalmic List (regulation 9), and
c)
amend schedule 1 to remove paragraph 5 (on notice for visits) and alter the time period in paragraph 13 for submitting a claim for fees for general ophthalmic services (regulation 12).
Regulation 13 makes savings provision in relation to the amendments made by regulations 3 to 6. The increases to the voucher values in the 1998 Regulations do not apply to vouchers accepted or used before these Regulations come into force.

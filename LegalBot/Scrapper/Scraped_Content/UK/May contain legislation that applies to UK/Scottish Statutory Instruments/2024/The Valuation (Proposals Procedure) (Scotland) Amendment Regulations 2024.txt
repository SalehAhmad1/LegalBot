25th June 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Valuation (Proposals Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (“the 2022 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 inserts new regulations 17ZA, 17ZB and 17ZC into the 2022 Regulations. These set out the timescales within which certain things require to be done in connection with the making of a proposal for alteration of an entry in a valuation roll and the handling of such a proposal. This brings together in one instrument the procedures and timescales for the making and disposal of proposals and the timescales for the making of appeals. Regulation 2 also makes consequential changes to the 2022 Regulations in light of the insertion of regulations 17ZA, 17ZB and 17ZC.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared in respect of the package of instruments of which the 2022 Regulations formed part. These Regulations do not alter the outcome of that assessment. Accordingly, no further assessment is required.

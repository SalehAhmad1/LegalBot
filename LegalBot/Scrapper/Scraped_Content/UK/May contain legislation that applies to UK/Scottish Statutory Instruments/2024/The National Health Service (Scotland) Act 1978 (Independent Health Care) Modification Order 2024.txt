13th June 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order modifies the definition of “independent health care services” in section 10F of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 (“the Act”).
Article 3(2)(a) modifies the definition of “independent clinic” in section 10F(2) of the Act to include a clinic not comprised in a hospital and in or from which services are provided by a registered pharmacist or registered pharmacy technician.
Article 3(2)(b) substitutes a new definition of “independent medical agency” in section 10F(2) of the Act. The new definition provides that an independent medical agency is, subject to section 10F(2D) of the Act, an undertaking which consists of or includes the provision of services, other than in pursuance of the Act, by a medical practitioner, dental practitioner, dental care professional, registered nurse, registered midwife, registered pharmacist, or registered pharmacy technician.
Article 3(3) modifies section 10F(2A) of the Act to provide that a clinic does not fall within the definition of “independent clinic” in section 10F(2) if it provides pharmaceutical services in accordance with arrangements made pursuant to section 27 of the Act or if it is a registered pharmacy within the meaning of section 74 of the Medicines Act 1968.
Article 3(4) substitutes a new section 10F(2B) of the Act which provides for definitions of “dental care professional” and “registered pharmacy technician” where these terms appear in the definitions of “independent clinic” and “independent medical agency” in section 10F(2) of the Act.
Article 3(5) inserts a new section 10F(2D) in to the Act which sets out which undertakings do not fall within the definition of “independent medical agency” in section 10F(2) of the Act.
This Order also modifies the independent health care functions (as defined in section 10E of the Act) of Health Improvement Scotland (“HIS”) to allow for cancellation of registration of an independent health service where it fails to pay the annual continuation fee (article 5). Additionally, where a service has previously had registration cancelled for non-payment of continuation fees, and the service seeks to register with HIS again, there is a requirement to pay any annual continuation fees that remained due (article 4).
Article 6 makes transitional provision so that the offence, in section 10Z9(1)(a) of the Act, of providing an independent health care service without being registered, does not apply to a registered pharmacist or a registered pharmacy technician providing services from an independent clinic for a period of 1 year after this Order comes into force.

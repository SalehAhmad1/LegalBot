This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992 (“the 1992 Order”).
Article 3(a) amends the interpretation provisions of the 1992 Order and together with articles 4(b), 5(b), 6(f)(ii), 9(b), 10(b), 11(b), 13, 15, 16 and 18 provides for a single definition of “World Heritage Site”.
Articles 4 and 5 amend Part 1 and Part 1ZA of schedule 1 of the 1992 Order in consequence of other changes made by the Order to ensure that, where particular provision is made in respect of the grant of permitted development rights for specified development, the development is excluded from the more general classes of development to which classes 2B, 3B and 4A apply.
Article 6 amends Part 1A of schedule 1 of the 1992 Order in relation to the installation of domestic microgeneration equipment. Article 6 amends the 1992 Order to replace the existing class 6G and to introduce new classes 6HA, 6HB and 6HC and makes consequential changes to the interpretation section of Part 1A.
Article 7 amends Part 1B of schedule 1 of the 1992 Order in relation to the installation of generation equipment on and within the curtilage of non-domestic buildings. It amends the 1992 Order to replace the existing class 6J and to introduce new class 6N and makes consequential changes to the interpretation section of Part 1B.
Article 8 amends Part 2 of schedule 1 of the 1992 Order to include a new class 7A which provides permitted development rights for the alteration or replacement of existing windows. Articles 9(a) and 10(a) make consequential amendment to class 9C and class 9D to exclude such development from class 9C and class 9D.
Article 14 amends Part 2I of schedule 1 of the 1992 Order to replace class 9M in respect of the grant of permitted development rights for solar canopies and related battery storage equipment.

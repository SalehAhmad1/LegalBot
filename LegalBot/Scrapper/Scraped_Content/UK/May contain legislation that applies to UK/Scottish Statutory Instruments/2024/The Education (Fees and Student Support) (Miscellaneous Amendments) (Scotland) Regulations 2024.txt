7th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (“the Fees Regulations”) and the Student Support (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (“the Student Support Regulations”).
These Regulations make amendments to schedule 1 of the Fees Regulations to remove the requirement for refugees and persons granted leave following on from a refugee claim to be ordinarily resident in Scotland on the relevant date and to remove the requirement for persons from other excepted categories to reside “at all times” in the United Kingdom since they have been granted leave to remain. These Regulations also amend schedule 2 of the Fees Regulations to apply the rules relating to ordinary residence on the relevant date to schedule 1 and to apply the rules relating to ordinary residence for the specified period to all categories in schedule 1.
Amendments are also made to both the Fees Regulations and the Student Support Regulations to extend home fees status and student support to female Afghan students who have been prevented from continuing with their studies in Afghanistan by the Taliban regime, and to victims of domestic violence or domestic abuse who have been abandoned overseas and granted leave to enter, and to their children. Eligibility of Ukrainian nationals for home fees status and student support has been extended to those applying under the new Ukrainian Permission Extension Scheme.
These Regulations amend eligibility for student loans in regulation 13 of the Student Support Regulations by excepting from eligibility those students who are in receipt of grants and allowances for social service workers’ training. Minor alteration is made to regulation 20 to remove a drafting error. Amendment is also made to regulation 22 to remove the restriction on loans being paid over the longest vacation period.
These Regulations also make amendments to schedule 1 of the Student Support Regulations to remove the requirement for refugees and persons granted leave following on from a refugee claim to be ordinarily resident in Scotland on the relevant date and to remove the requirement for categories of persons listed in that schedule to reside “at all times” in the United Kingdom and Islands since they have been granted leave to remain. Schedule 3 is amended to apply the rules related to ordinary residence on the relevant date to schedule 2 and to apply the rules related to ordinary residence for the specified period to all categories in schedules 1 and 2. Schedule 4 is amended to update the list of courses designated for the purposes of student loans and student loans for tuition fees at institutions located in the United Kingdom but outside Scotland.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 53(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) provides that an education authority must provide or secure the provision of a school lunch (as defined in section 53(12)) free of charge to pupils falling within section 53(7).
Regulation 2(a) of these Regulations amends section 53(7)(aa) of the 1980 Act. This has the effect that a pupil will fall within section 53(7) if the parents of the pupil are in receipt of child tax credit and working tax credit provided that the income as calculated for the purpose of awarding those tax credits does not exceed £9,552.
Regulation 2(b) of these Regulations amends section 53(7)(c) of the 1980 Act. This has the effect that a pupil will fall within section 53(7) if the pupil is, or the parents of the pupil are, in receipt of universal credit provided that qualifying criteria about earned income of the pupil or the parents are satisfied. Where the person in receipt of universal credit is not a member of a couple, the criteria will be satisfied if the person’s earned income does not exceed £796 in the assessment period preceding the application. Where the person in receipt of universal credit is a member of a couple, the criteria will be satisfied if the couple’s combined earned income does not exceed £796 in the assessment period preceding the application.

(c)
the clinical judgement was made in accordance with paragraphs (6) and (7) (“the judgement”),

someone to whom regulation 9(4) (residence and presence conditions) or 14(2) (persons residing outside the United Kingdom to whom a relevant EU regulation applies) applies,
“sufficient” means a link to Scotland that is sufficiently close that regulations 9(4) or 14(2) would be incompatible with the applicable agreement mentioned in that regulation, if the relevant individual were not entitled to Pension Age Disability Payment, and
“transferring individual” means an individual on whom the Scottish Ministers have served a notice of intention to transfer in accordance with paragraph 8.
Notice of intention to transfer to Pension Age Disability Payment
8.—(1) The Scottish Ministers are to notify each relevant individual of their intention to transfer that individual’s entitlement to disability assistance from an entitlement to Attendance Allowance to an entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment.
(2) Notice under sub-paragraph (1) must—
(a)
be given in a way that leaves the relevant individual with a record of the information which they can show to, or otherwise share with, others,
(b)
inform the relevant individual that—
(i)
they have been identified as a relevant individual for the purposes of transfer to Pension Age Disability Payment,
(ii)
the Scottish Ministers will make a determination without application to transfer the individual’s entitlement to Attendance Allowance to an entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment within a period to be specified within the notice (the individual will be notified when the determination is made and informed about their award and start date of Pension Age Disability Payment), and
(iii)
the individual’s award of Attendance Allowance will cease—
(aa)
immediately before the award of Pension Age Disability Payment begins, or
(bb)
where a transferring individual was paid Attendance Allowance one week in advance and 3 weekly in arrears, the date one week after the date their entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment begins.
(3) Where a notice under sub-paragraph (1) is given—
(a)
to a transferring individual who, before a determination is made under paragraph 9(1), ceases to be ordinarily resident in Scotland, or
(b)
in error where the individual is neither—
(i)
ordinarily resident in Scotland, nor
(ii)
an individual who is habitually resident in an EEA state, Gibraltar or Switzerland and has a genuine and sufficient link to Scotland,
the duty on the Scottish Ministers in paragraph 9(1) does not apply.
(4) Where sub-paragraph (3) applies in respect of an individual and a determination under paragraph 9(1) has not been made, the Scottish Ministers are to notify the individual that the duty on the Scottish Ministers in paragraph 9(1) does not apply.
Determination without application of entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment
9.—(1) The Scottish Ministers are to make a determination without application in respect of a transferring individual of that individual’s entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment.
(2) Entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment under a determination under sub-paragraph (1) begins on the date specified in the notice of determination given to the transferring individual in accordance with section 40 of the 2018 Act.

(a)
such information as the Scottish Ministers have received from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in respect of the transferring individual’s entitlement to Attendance Allowance, and
(b)
any other information available to the Scottish Ministers that appears to them to be relevant.
(4) Subject to paragraph 11, a determination under sub-paragraph (1) must be made on the basis that the transferring individual is entitled to the rate of Pension Age Disability Payment that is equivalent to the rate of Attendance Allowance to which the individual was entitled immediately before the date of transfer.
(5) A determination under sub-paragraph (1)—
(a)
may be made on the assumption that whatever can be discerned about the transferring individual’s circumstances from the information mentioned in sub-paragraph (3) remains accurate on the date on which the determination is made,
(b)
notwithstanding the generality of head (a), is to be made on the assumption that the conditions relating to residence and presence set out in regulations 9 to 16 (residence and presence conditions) are satisfied in the individual’s case, and
(c)
must be made not later than the end of the period specified within the notice under paragraph 8(1) unless the Scottish Ministers have—
(i)
good reason to extend that period,
(ii)
agreed the period for extension with the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and
(iii)
notified the transferring individual of the extension and the reason for it.
Effect of determination on entitlement to Attendance Allowance
10.—(1) Where a determination is made under paragraph 9 that the transferring individual is entitled to Pension Age Disability Payment, the transferring individual’s entitlement to Attendance Allowance will cease on—
(a)
the date their entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment begins, or
(b)
where a transferring individual was paid Attendance Allowance one week in advance and 3 weekly in arrears, the date one week after the date their entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment begins, or

where paragraph 11 applies, the date their entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment would have begun had paragraph 11(2) not applied to set an earlier date of entitlement.

section 64(1A) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992(2), and

received information from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions that the transferring individual is terminally ill in terms of section 82 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 immediately before the date of transfer, or
(b)
not received information from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions that the transferring individual is terminally ill in terms of section 82 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012, but become aware, before they have made a determination under paragraph 9(1), that the individual has a terminal illness in terms of regulation 18(6) (entitlement under special rules for terminal illness),
the determination made under paragraph 9(1) must be made on the basis that the transferring individual satisfies the conditions for the higher rate of Pension Age Disability Payment.
(2) Where sub-paragraph (1) applies—
(a)
paragraphs (3) to (5) of regulation 18 do not apply, and
(b)
the transferring individual’s entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment will commence on whichever is the later of—

the day that the clinical judgement was made in accordance with regulation 18(6), or

the day one year before the determination was made in accordance with paragraph 9(1).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for Pension Age Disability Payment which is a type of disability assistance given by the Scottish Ministers under section 31 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018.
Part 2 provides an overview of arrangements for payment of disability assistance for older people (“Pension Age Disability Payment”).
Part 3 deals with eligibility for the assistance on account of satisfying the daytime or the night-time condition and the required period of 26 weeks, makes provision for when an individual may be awarded lower rate or higher rate of Pension Age Disability Payment, and sets rules for entitlement to Pension Age Disability Payment when an individual is undergoing renal dialysis outwith a hospital.
Part 4 makes provision for circumstances where individuals had previous awards of Attendance Allowance or Pension Age Disability Payment within two years of an application.
Part 5 sets out the residence and presence conditions for entitlement to the assistance.
Part 6 sets out the entitlement rules relating to age.
Part 7 sets out the rules for entitlement to the assistance on account of having a terminal illness.
Part 8 sets out the effects on payment of the assistance when an individual is resident in a care home, hospital or legal detention.
Part 9 deals with payments, the amount and form of the assistance, the making of applications, the beginning of entitlement to the assistance, time of payment, and continuing eligibility. It also provides for circumstances in which the assistance may be suspended, giving assistance by way of deduction, and when increases or decreases of entitlement take effect.
Part 10 deals with reconsideration of entitlement, where an award of assistance has already been made and is being revisited. It provides for determinations without application to be made where a specified period has elapsed, there is a change in circumstances, to address error or official error or to effect a deduction decision.
Part 11 provides for the situation where people in Scotland in receipt of the assistance move to another part of the United Kingdom, or people in another part of the United Kingdom in receipt of the equivalent assistance, Attendance Allowance, move to Scotland.
Part 12 provides for time periods for dealing with requests for re-determination of entitlement.
Part 13 and Part 1 of the schedule deal with entitlement to short-term assistance, to bridge the gap, in the event that entitlement to the assistance is reduced or removed. This is payable, in certain circumstances, during the time when the change in entitlement is being reviewed but the outcome is not yet known.
Part 14, Part 16 and Part 2 of the schedule make provision for the initial period for applications.
Part 15 and Part 3 of the schedule make provision to transfer individuals who meet the residence and presence conditions and are awarded Attendance Allowance to become entitled to the assistance.
Part 17 and Part 4 of the schedule make provision for a consequential amendment to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.
Part 18 and Part 5 of the schedule make provision for miscellaneous amendments to the Disability Assistance for Children and Young People (Scotland) Regulations and the Disability Assistance for Working Age People (Scotland) Regulations 2022.

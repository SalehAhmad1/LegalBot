20th February 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make minor amendments to the Non-Domestic Rates (Transitional Relief) (Scotland) Regulations 2024 (“the 2024 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(2) substitutes a new paragraph (1) into regulation 11 of the 2024 Regulations. It makes clear that where any relief from liability to non-domestic rates applies, other than relief under Part 2 of these Regulations, the reduction in liability must be applied to the transitional limit in any situation where the amount of rates otherwise payable would exceed the transitional limit, provided regulation 12 does not apply. In other words, the amount of rates actually payable is to be arrived at through applying the reduction to the amount of rates payable in accordance with the transitional limit, rather than to the amount of rates that would be payable if any increase in rates liability was not capped in accordance with the transitional limit.
Regulation 2(3) makes a consequential amendment to regulation 12 of the 2024 Regulations, following on the change to regulation 11.
Regulation 2(4) makes an amendment to the 2024 Regulations where they amend the non-Domestic Rates (Restriction of Relief) (Scotland) Regulations 2023, to add hospitality relief for islands and remote areas to the list of reliefs the award of which must be compatible with the Subsidy Control Act 2022 (c. 23).

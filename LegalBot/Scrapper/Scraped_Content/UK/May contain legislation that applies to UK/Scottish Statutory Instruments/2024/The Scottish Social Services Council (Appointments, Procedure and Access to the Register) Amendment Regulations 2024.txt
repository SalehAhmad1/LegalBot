(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 13(2) of the Scottish Social Services Council (Appointments, Procedure and Access to the Register) Regulations 2001 (“the 2001 Regulations”) to expand the categories of information that may be disclosed to persons accessing the register kept by the Scottish Social Services Council (“the SSSC”) under section 44 of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001.
Regulation 2(a) of these Regulations amends regulation 13(2)(a) of the 2001 Regulations to provide that relevant employers will be able to see not only the part of the register upon which a person is registered (which is currently the case), but also (where applicable) the type of service that person works in and whether they are working as a manager, supervisor, practitioner or support worker.
Regulation 2(b) to (d) of these Regulations amend regulation 13(2)(b) of the 2001 Regulations with the effect that persons other than relevant employers will now be able to see (i) any conditions or warnings which the SSSC has imposed on the registration of a person registered on that register, (ii) any specialist qualifications held by persons so registered which are shown on the register and (iii) (where applicable) the type of service that person on the register works in and the level of their role. In respect of (i) and (iii), disclosure will not be made where the SSSC consider this could reasonably be expected to expose the person registered, removed or suspended from the register to danger.

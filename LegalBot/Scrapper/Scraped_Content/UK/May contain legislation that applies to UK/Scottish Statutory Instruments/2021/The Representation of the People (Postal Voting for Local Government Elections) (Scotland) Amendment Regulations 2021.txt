(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Representation of the People (Postal Voting for Local Government Elections) (Scotland) Regulations 2007. Regulation 2(2) changes the time limit on the day of the poll by which voters utilising a postal vote for local government elections may request a replacement of a spoilt ballot paper. Regulation 2(3) changes the time limit on the day of the poll by which voters utilising a postal vote for such elections may request a replacement for a lost ballot paper. The time limits are changed from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. This standardises practice with Scottish Parliament election procedure.

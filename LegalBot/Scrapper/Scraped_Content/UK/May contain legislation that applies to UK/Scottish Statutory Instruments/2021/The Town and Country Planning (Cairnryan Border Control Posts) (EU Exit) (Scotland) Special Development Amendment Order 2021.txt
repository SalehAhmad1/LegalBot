(This note is note part of the Order)
This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (Cairnryan Border Control Posts) (EU Exit) (Scotland) Special Development Order 2021 (“the SDO”). Article 3 adds a definition of “border department” to the SDO, and expands the definition of “developer” to include a border department. Article 4 amends article 3 of the SDO so that the planning permission granted by the SDO includes permission for development for the purposes of any activity that forms part of the functions of a border department. Article 5 amends schedule 2 of the SDO which applies conditions to planning permission granted by article 3 of the SDO. Articles 3(c), 4(a)(ii) and (b), 5(b) and 6 make minor amendments to the SDO to correct typographical and formatting errors.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Fireworks (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2021 on 22 March 2021 and amend the Fireworks (Scotland) Regulations 2004 (“the 2004 Regulations”) on 30 June 2021.
Regulation 2(2) inserts a definition of “public fireworks display” into the 2004 Regulations meaning a fireworks display at which the public, or any section of the public, are present, whether or not they have paid to be.
Regulation 2(3) amends regulation 3 of the 2004 Regulations to the effect that it is prohibited to use fireworks outside of permitted hours. The permitted hours for this regulation are between 18.00 and 23.00. The exceptions to this prohibition set out in regulation 3(2) of the 2004 Regulations are also amended to the effect that fireworks may be used between 07.00 and 18.00 but only by particular persons for particular purposes. The times of day that fireworks can be used on a “permitted fireworks night” set out in regulation 3(3) of the 2004 Regulations remain unchanged.
Regulation 2(4) inserts new regulations 3A and 3B into the 2004 Regulations. Regulation 3A prohibits the supply of adult fireworks outside permitted hours, the permitted hours for this regulation are between 07.00 and 18.00. This is subject to the exceptions set out in regulation 3A(3).
New regulation 3B(1) prohibits the supply of more than the permitted quantity of fireworks at any one time. Regulation 3B(2) sets out that the “permitted quantity” means fireworks with a total net mass of explosive substance of 5 kilograms. This is subject to the exceptions set out in regulation 3B(3).
Regulation 3 revokes the Fireworks (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2021.

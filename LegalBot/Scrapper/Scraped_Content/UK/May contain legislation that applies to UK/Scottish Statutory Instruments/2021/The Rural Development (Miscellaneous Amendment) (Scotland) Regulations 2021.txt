(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments for securing the simplification and improvement of retained EU law governing rural support schemes in Scotland and to correct deficiencies resulting from EU exit.
EU legislation governing rural development schemes became domestic law on IP completion day under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) (the “2018 Act”). “IP completion day” means 31 December 2020 at 11.00pm (see section 1A(6) of the 2018 Act and section 39(1) to (5) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c.1)).
No business or regulatory impact assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

SOCIAL SECURITY
The Social Security Up-rating (Scotland) Order 2021
Made
24th March 2021
Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1(2), (3) and (4)
The Scottish Ministers make the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 150(9), 150A(6), and 189(1) and (4) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992(1) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
As required by section 150(1)(a)(i)(2), 150(1)(b) and 150(1)(o)(3) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, the Scottish Ministers have made a review and it appeared to the Scottish Ministers that the general level of prices was greater at the end of the period under review than it was at the beginning of the period.
As required by section 150A(1)(c)(4) of that Act, the Scottish Ministers have also made a review and it appeared to the Scottish Ministers that the general level of earnings was no greater at the end of the period under review than it was at the beginning of the period and the Scottish Ministers consider it appropriate having regard to the national economic situation and other matters which the Scottish Ministers consider relevant to increase the amounts referred to in section 150A(1)(c) of that Act.
In accordance with sections 150(2) and 150A(2A)(5) of that Act a draft of this Order has been laid before and approved by resolution of the Scottish Parliament.
(1)
1992 c.5. The function of making an order to up-rate or restate the rate of carers’, disability and industrial injuries benefits transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46) as read with sections 22(2) and 32 of the Scotland Act 2016 (c.11). Section 22(2) of that Act inserted exceptions into the social security reservation in Head F1 of Part 2 of Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998 relating to carers’, disability and industrial injuries benefits. Section 22(2) was brought into force on 17th May 2017 by S.I. 2017/455, subject to transitional arrangements set out in S.I. 2017/444 which provided that pre-commencement functions would not transfer to the Scottish Ministers until the occurrence of a specified event or date. The transitional arrangements in respect of carers’ benefits were ended by the commencement of section 81 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (asp 9) on 3rd September 2018 (see S.S.I. 2018/250). The transitional arrangements in respect of disability benefits and industrial injuries benefits ended on 31st March 2020 (see regulation 4 of S.I. 2017/444). Accordingly, in so far as the functions under sections 150 and 150A are exercisable within devolved competence for various benefits, they are now exercisable by the Scottish Ministers instead of by the Secretary of State. Section 189(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (c.5) was amended by paragraph 109(a) of schedule 7, and schedule 8, of the Social Security Act 1998 (c.14) (“the 1998 Act”), paragraph 57 of schedule 3 of the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc.) Act 1999 (c.2) and schedule 6 of the Tax Credits Act 2002 (c.21). Section 189(4) was amended by section 86, paragraph 109(c) of schedule 7, and schedule 8 of the 1998 Act and article 4 and Part 1 of the schedule of S.I. 2013/252.
(2)
A new section 150(1)(a)(i) was substituted by section 6(1) and (2)(a) of the Pensions Act 2007 (c.22).
(3)
Section 150(1)(o) was amended by paragraph 17 of schedule 9 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (c.5).
(4)
Section 150A was inserted by section 5(1) of the Pensions Act 2007 (c.22) and amended by paragraphs 8, 19 and 82 of Schedule 12 of the Pensions Act 2007 and S.I. 2014/2888. Section 150A of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 was modified by section 1 of the Social Security (Up-rating of Benefits) Act 2020 (c.23) to include, by inserting subsection (2A), the discretion to increase the amounts referred to in section 150A(1). Section 1 of that Act also inserted subsection (2B) into section 150A of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 which allows, where provision in respect of the amounts referred to in subsection (1)(c) is within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, for references in that subsection to the Secretary of State to be treated as a reference to the Scottish Ministers, and the references to Parliament to be treated as references to the Scottish Parliament.
(5)
Section 150A(2A) was inserted by section 1(a) of the Social Security (Up-rating of Benefits) Act 2020 (c.23). Section 1(a) of that Act also inserted section 150A(2B) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 which allows, where provision in respect of the amounts referred to in subsection (1)(c) is within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, for references in section 150A(2A) to the Secretary of State to be treated as a reference to the Scottish Ministers, and the references to Parliament to be treated as references to the Scottish Parliament.Citation, commencement and interpretation

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides for an increase in the various rates of carer’s allowance, attendance allowance, disability living allowance, industrial injuries disablement benefit, industrial death benefit, severe disablement allowance, and personal independence payment. The Order comes into force on 1 April 2021. Article 2 comes into force on the first day of the first benefit week to commence for a particular beneficiary on or after 1 April 2021. Articles 3, 4, 5, 6(1)(b), 7, 8 and 9 come into force on 12 April 2021. Articles 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 set out the dates on which the increases take effect.
Articles 2, 5 and 6 provide for a mandatory re-statement of amounts of payments which are not to be increased. These give effect to the requirement in section 150(2)(c) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992to re-state amounts of payments that are not being increased.
Article 2 provides solely for the mandatory restatement of the earnings limits which relate to child dependency increase. This is an additional payment payable to a recipient of carer’s allowance who is entitled to receive child benefit in relation to a child or children. It is payable only to those with transitional protection. Child dependency increase was abolished by section 1(3)(e) and schedule 6 of the Tax Credits Act 2002 but saved for transitional cases by article 3 of the Tax Credits Act 2002 (Commencement No. 3 and Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order 2003. Given that child benefit is payable, in certain circumstances, until a child reaches the age of 20, child dependency increase is potentially payable until 2023.
Article 3 amends part III of schedule 4 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (the 1992 Act) to provide increases in both the higher and lower weekly rates of attendance allowance.
Article 4 amends Part III of schedule 4 of the 1992 Act to provide increases in the weekly rate of severe disablement allowance and all three weekly rates of the age related addition of that allowance.
Article 5 amends Part III and Part IV of schedule 4 of the 1992 Act to provide for the increase in the weekly rate of carer’s allowance. It also restates the weekly rate of carer’s allowance increase for a qualifying child.
Article 6 amends Part IV of schedule 4 of the 1992 Act to increase the rates for adult dependants payable with severe disablement allowance. It also restates the rate of increase for a qualifying child.
Article 7 amends Part V of schedule 4 of the 1992 Act to increase various weekly rates of industrial injuries benefit and industrial death benefit, as set out in the table below.
Article 8 amends regulation 4 of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 to increase the five weekly rates, as divided across both the care and mobility components, of disability living allowance.
Article 9 amends regulation 24 of the Social Security (Personal Independence Payment) Regulations 2013 to increase the four weekly rates, as divided across both the daily living and mobility components, of personal independence payment.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for this Order as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

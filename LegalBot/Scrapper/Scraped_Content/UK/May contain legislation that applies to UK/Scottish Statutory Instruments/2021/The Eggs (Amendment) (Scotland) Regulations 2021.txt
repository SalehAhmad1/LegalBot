(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Regulation (EC) No 589/2008 (“EUR 2008/589”) which establishes marketing standards for eggs. EUR 2008/589 is retained EU law, as defined in section 6(7) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16). These Regulations come into force on 1 January 2022.
Regulation 2 amends Article 24(3) (checks) of EUR 2008/589. The amendment allows marketing standards checks on Class A eggs imported from third countries to take place before being offered for sale to the final consumer or to mass caterers, rather than at the time of customs clearance and before release for free circulation. For example, checks could take place at packing centres and wholesalers’ premises.

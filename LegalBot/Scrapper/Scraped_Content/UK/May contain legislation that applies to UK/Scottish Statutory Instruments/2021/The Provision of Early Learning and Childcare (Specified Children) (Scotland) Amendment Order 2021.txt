This Order amends the Provision of Early Learning and Childcare (Specified Children) (Scotland) Order 2014 (S.S.I. 2014/196) (“the 2014 Order”). The 2014 Order specifies those children who are eligible pre-school children for the purposes of section 47(2)(c)(ii) of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 (asp 8) and who are entitled to the mandatory amount of early learning and childcare (as defined in section 48 of that Act). This Order removes the exception from eligibility for children whose birthday falls in the period beginning on 1 August and ending on 31 December and who turn 5 years old after the start of the school year.

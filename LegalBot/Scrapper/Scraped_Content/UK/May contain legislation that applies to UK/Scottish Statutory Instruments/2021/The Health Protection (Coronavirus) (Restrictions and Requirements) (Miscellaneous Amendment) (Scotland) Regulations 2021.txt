(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Restrictions and Requirements) (Local Levels) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the Local Levels Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Directions by Local Authorities) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the Directions Regulations”). These Regulations come into force on 29 January 2021.
Regulation 3 inserts definitions into the Local Levels Regulations for the purposes of the amendments made by these Regulations.
Regulation 4 amends the Local Levels Regulations to make provision requiring drive-in event venues to close in a Level 3 area. It also amends paragraph 1 of schedule 4 of those Regulations to exempt premises in a Level 3 area from closure for electoral purposes if they are suitable premises which a returning officer or electoral registration officer has requested the use of in connection with the carrying out of any of their functions in relation to an election. Additionally, it amends paragraph 5 of that schedule to remove the restrictions on premises used by food and drink businesses so that they may be used in connection with an election on the same basis.
Regulation 5 amends the Local Levels Regulations to make provision requiring drive-in event venues to close in a Level 4 area.
Regulation 5 also amends schedule 5 of the Local Levels Regulations to enable suitable premises required to close, or permitted to open only for specified purposes, in a Level 4 area to be used in connection with an election if a returning officer or electoral registration officer has requested their use in connection with the carrying out of any of their functions. This includes retail and library premises, premises used by food and drink businesses, places of worship and holiday accommodation.
Regulation 5 also makes amendments to the Local Levels Regulations to provide that the same restrictions will apply to a person coming into a Level 4 area, from an area in another level, to attend a marriage, civil partnership or funeral as apply to a person living in a Level 4 area.
Regulation 6 changes the date for the expiration of the Directions Regulations from 31 January 2021 to 31 March 2021.

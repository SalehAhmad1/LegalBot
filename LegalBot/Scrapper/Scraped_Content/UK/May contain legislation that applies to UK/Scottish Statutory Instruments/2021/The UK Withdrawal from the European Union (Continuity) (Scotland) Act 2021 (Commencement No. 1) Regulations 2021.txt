(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force certain provisions of the UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Continuity) (Scotland) Act 2021 (“the Act”) on 29 March 2021.
Regulation 2 brings Part 1 and sections 13, 18 and 47 fully into force, and section 15 for the limited purpose specified.
Part 1 of the Act provides for a power to enable the Scottish Ministers to align devolved law with EU law so far as appropriate following the end of the implementation period provided for in the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, which was when EU law ceased to apply in the United Kingdom as a consequence of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
Section 13 establishes in domestic law guiding principles on the environment. Section 18 sets out the procedure for the publication of guidance on those guiding principles, including requirements on the Scottish Ministers to consult on the guidance and lay it before the Scottish Parliament prior to publication.
Section 15 provides that where public authorities are responsible authorities in terms of the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005 (“the 2005 Act”), they must have due regard to the guiding principles on the environment when doing anything in respect of which the duty under section 1 of the 2005 Act (to carry out an environmental assessment) applies. Section 15 is brought into force only to enable the Scottish Ministers to consult with each responsible authority which is subject to the duty under section 15, in accordance with section 18(3)(b). Accordingly, responsible authorities need not have due regard to the guiding principles when doing anything in respect of which the duty under section 1 of the 2005 Act applies until section 15 is brought fully into force at a later date.
Section 47 requires the Scottish Ministers to prepare and publish an environmental policy strategy.
The Bill for the 2021 Act received Royal Assent on 29 January 2021. In accordance with section 51(1) of that Act, sections 48 to 53 came into force the following day.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order grants temporary planning permission for development consisting of the use of land for the stationing and processing of vehicles entering or leaving Great Britain, and the provision of associated temporary facilities and infrastructure. Development permitted by this Order can only be carried out by, or on behalf of, the Scottish Ministers (the “developer”). The planning permission granted by this Order is for a limited period and use of the land as authorised by the planning permission must discontinue 5 years after the development becomes operational. All reinstatement works must be completed by 6 years after the development becomes operational.
Article 1(2) and schedule 1 specify the area to which the Order applies. Article 3 grants temporary planning permission, describing the development that is permitted, and specifies that the permission is granted subject to conditions set out in schedule 2, and other conditions as may be specified.
Article 4 requires that before any development can take place, the developer must have obtained the approval of the Scottish Ministers. Article 4 sets out what information is required in a written submission for this approval, and includes a requirement for the developer to consult the engagement parties set out in schedule 3.

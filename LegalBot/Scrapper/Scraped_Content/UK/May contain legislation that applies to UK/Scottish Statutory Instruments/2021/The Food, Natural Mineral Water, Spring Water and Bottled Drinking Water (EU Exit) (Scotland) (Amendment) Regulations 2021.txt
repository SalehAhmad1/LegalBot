(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to domestic food and labelling legislation to address matters arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends the Natural Mineral Water, Spring Water and Bottled Drinking Water (Scotland) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 to address the recognition of EEA natural mineral water, spring water and bottled drinking water following the end of the Implementation Period.
Regulation 3 amends the Food Information (Scotland) Regulations 2014 and introduces a transitional period from the commencement of these Regulations and ending on 30 September 2022. During this transitional period food business operators will be permitted to continue to place food products on the UK market that still comply with and reflect the labelling requirements applicable before this regulation comes into force.
Regulation 4 amends the Country of Origin of Certain Meats (Scotland) Regulations 2016 and introduces a transitional provision from the commencement of these Regulations and ending on 30 September 2022. During this transitional period food business operators may continue to place on the UK market fresh, chilled and frozen meat of swine, sheep, goats and poultry products still reflecting the indication of the country of origin or place of provenance requirements applicable before this regulation comes into force.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

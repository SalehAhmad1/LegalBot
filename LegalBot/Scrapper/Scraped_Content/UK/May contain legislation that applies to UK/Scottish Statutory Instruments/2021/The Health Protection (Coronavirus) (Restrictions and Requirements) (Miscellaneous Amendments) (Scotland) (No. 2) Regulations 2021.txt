The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 1(1) of schedule 19 of the Coronavirus Act 2020(1) (“the Act”) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of coronavirus in Scotland.
The Scottish Ministers consider that the restrictions and requirements imposed by these Regulations are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with paragraph 6(2) and (3) of schedule 19 of the Act, the Scottish Ministers are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make these Regulations without a draft having been laid before, and approved by, a resolution of the Scottish Parliament.

At 11.26 a.m. on 4th March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions and Requirements) (Local Levels) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the Local Levels Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Directions by Local Authorities) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the Directions Regulations”). These Regulations come into force on 5 March 2021.
Regulation 3 amends the definition of “end of term household” in regulation 2 of the Local Levels Regulations to reflect removal by regulations 6, 7(4) and (5) and 8 of provisions relating to the formation of such a household by students which are no longer relevant. It also substitutes the definition of “professional sportsperson” and inserts related definitions. Regulation 4 removes provision relating to holiday gatherings.
Regulation 5 amends regulation 9 of the Local Levels Regulations to extend the date on which those regulations are due to expire until 30 September 2021.
Regulation 7 makes amendments to schedule 5 of the Local Levels Regulations. It amends paragraph 1 of the schedule to remove the requirement for child contact centres to close to members of the public. Amendments are also made in relation to the permitted use of premises that are required to be closed to the public, for the purposes of a performance, professional sport and non-professional sport. These amendments clarify that use of indoor fitness studios, gyms, swimming pools and other indoor leisure centres or facilities is restricted to performers and professional sportspersons. Regulation 7 also removes public libraries from the requirement to close to members of the public insofar as is necessary to provide free computer and internet access by appointment.
Regulation 9 amends regulation 15(1) of the Directions Regulations to extend the date on which those regulations are due to expire until 30 September 2021.

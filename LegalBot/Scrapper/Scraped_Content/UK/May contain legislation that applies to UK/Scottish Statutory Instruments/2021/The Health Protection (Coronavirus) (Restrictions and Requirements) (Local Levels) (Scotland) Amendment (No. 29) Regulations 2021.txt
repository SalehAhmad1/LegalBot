At 1.57 p.m. on 24th June 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions and Requirements) (Local Levels) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the Local Levels Regulations”).
Regulation 3 amends schedule 1 of the Local Levels Regulations to remove the requirement, in a Level 0 area, for persons to maintain the required distance when carrying or setting down a coffin or lowering or assisting in the lowering of the coffin into a lair as part of a funeral or the preparations for a funeral. The same amendments are made to schedule 2 for Level 1 areas by regulation 4(4); to schedule 3 for Level 2 areas by regulation 5(4); to schedule 4 for Level 3 areas by regulation 6; and to schedule 5 for Level 4 areas by regulation 7.
Regulation 4(2) and (3) amends schedule 2 of the Local Levels Regulations to reduce the hours between which food and drink businesses and casinos must remain closed in Level 1 areas where the premises are showing a live match as part of the UEFA European Championship and the match has not finished by 11pm. Those premises must close at the conclusion of the match or 11.30pm, whichever is earlier. The same amendments are made to schedule 3 for Level 2 areas by regulation 5(2) and (3) where the match has not finished by 10.30pm.
Regulation 5 also amends schedule 3 so that the required distance to be maintained between persons in Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, at the 1888 Cup rugby event on 26 June 2021 is reduced to at least 1.15 metres.
Regulation 8 amends schedule 7 of the Local Levels Regulations to remove the requirement for persons accompanying a party to be married or entering into a civil partnership to wear a face covering.

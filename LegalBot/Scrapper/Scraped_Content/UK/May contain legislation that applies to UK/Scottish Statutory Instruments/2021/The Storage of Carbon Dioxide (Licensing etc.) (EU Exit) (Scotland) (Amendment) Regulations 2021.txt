EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16). These Regulations make amendments to legislation concerning the licensing regime for the geological storage of carbon dioxide. The amendments address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(d) and (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
No Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations, as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (International Travel and Operator Liability) (Scotland) Regulations 2021 (“the International Travel Regulations”).
Regulation 3 amends regulation 26 of the International Travel Regulations to allow a child under the age of 11 who is an eligible vaccinated arrival and has arrived in Scotland accompanied by an adult who has responsibility for them, to leave the specified premises in which they are required to stay by regulation 26(2), if that adult’s day 2 test generates a negative result.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 27 of the International Travel Regulations to provide that a child who is under the age of 11, who is an eligible vaccinated arrival and who arrives in Scotland unaccompanied by an adult is not required to comply with Part 6.
Regulation 5 amends schedule 1 of the International Travel Regulation to remove Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe from the list of “red list countries”.
Regulation 6 makes savings provision to the effect that a person arriving in Scotland before these Regulations come into effect must comply with the International Travel Regulations as they had effect at the time of the person’s arrival in Scotland. The amendments made by these Regulations apply only in relation to persons arriving in Scotland at or after 4.00 a.m. on 15 December 2021.

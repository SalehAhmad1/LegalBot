(This note is not part of the Regulations)
By virtue of section 2(4)(a) of the Coronavirus (Extension and Expiry) (Scotland) Act 2021, paragraph 11 of schedule 4 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020 (“the 2020 Act”) will expire at the end of 30 September 2021. These Regulations make saving provision in connection with that expiry and provide that the modifications to section 259 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (c.46) which were made by paragraph 11 of schedule 4 of the 2020 Act continue in effect in relation to evidence of a statement admitted before the end of 30 September 2021. This makes clear that the rules contained in section 259, as modified, continue to apply in proceedings where a statement has been introduced in evidence prior to the expiry of the relevant modifications.

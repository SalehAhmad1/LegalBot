(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations specify the information which must be recorded where a child is taken to and kept in a place of safety by a constable under section 28(2) of the Age of Criminal Responsibility (Scotland) Act 2019 (“the Act”). The records created in accordance with regulation 2 may be drawn on by the Scottish Ministers to compile the reports on the use of the place of safety power which are required by section 32 of the Act (Section 84 of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 enables the Scottish Ministers to obtain information from the Scottish Police Authority about the exercise of police functions, and also provides for the Authority to obtain such information from the chief constable).

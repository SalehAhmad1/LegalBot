(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Road Works (Qualifications of Operatives and Supervisors) (Scotland) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”). The 2017 Regulations prescribe the qualifications required of supervisors and trained operatives executing certain types of road works.
A person has a prescribed qualification for a type of work listed in schedules 1 or 2 of the 2017 Regulations if the person is qualified in that type of work and the additional types of work specified in regulation 3(1)(b) (for trained operatives) or regulation 3(2)(b) (for supervisors). A person is qualified in a type of work if an approved body has issued a certificate of competence showing that the person has been assessed as having the required level of competence in that type of work (regulation 3(3)(a)). Regulation 8(1) sets out the approved bodies for the purposes of issuing certificates of competence.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the 2017 Regulations to add an approved body (Lantra) to the list set out at regulation 8(1) of the 2017 Regulations.

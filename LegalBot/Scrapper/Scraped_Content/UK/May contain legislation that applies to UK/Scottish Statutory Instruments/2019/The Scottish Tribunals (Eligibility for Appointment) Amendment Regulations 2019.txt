(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 3D of the Scottish Tribunals (Eligibility for Appointment) Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”) to expand the eligibility criteria for appointment of ordinary members of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland in respect of disability experience.
The amendments made by regulation 2 provide that a person who has previously provided professional or voluntary support, or has provided care, to a person with a disability may be eligible for appointment, in addition to those who are doing so at the time they are appointed. The same applies to a person who previously had a disability but is no longer considered to do so.
Regulation 3D was inserted into the 2015 Regulations by the Scottish Tribunals (Eligibility for Appointment) Amendment Regulations 2018 (S.S.I. 2018/276). A partial Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared in respect of the package of Regulations of which those amending Regulations formed part. The current Regulations do not alter the outcome of that assessment. Accordingly, no further Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment is required.

These Regulations are principally made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of the common agricultural policy.
Part 2 (regulation 2), made in exercise of powers under the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68), updates a reference in relation to secondary legislation.
Part 3 (regulations 3 to 8) make amendments to secondary legislation consequential on the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
No Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations, as no, or no significant, impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

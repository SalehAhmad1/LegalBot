EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are mainly made in exercise of the powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) to address deficiencies in EU-derived domestic legislation in the fields of animal health and welfare and official controls (relating to animals, feed and food) in Scotland arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. But Part 2 is made in exercise of powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68).
Regulation 2 updates references to EU legislation in the Official Controls (Animals, Feed and Food) (Scotland) Regulations 2007. Regulation 3 amends the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (Scotland) Regulations 2012 to make it clear that an applicant for a certificate of competence no longer has the option of demonstrating relevant professional experience, as this is no longer available under the EU law. These amendments come into force on 31 October 2019.
Regulations 4, 5 and 6 amend, respectively, the Official Controls (Animals, Feed and Food) (Scotland) Regulations 2007, the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Scotland) Regulations 2012, and the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (Scotland) Regulations 2012, so as to prevent, remedy or mitigate deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. These amendments come into force on exit day.
Regulation 7 revokes regulation 19(2)(b) (the Avian Influenza (H5N1 in Poultry) (Scotland) Order 2007) of the Animal Health (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019. This comes into force immediately before exit day.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made by the Scottish Ministers in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraphs 1(1) and (3) of Schedule 2 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16), in order to address failures of EU derived domestic law to operate effectively and other deficiencies as regards Scotland that arise from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments in the fields of animal health and animal welfare.
Regulation 2 amends schedule 1 of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 (asp 11), in order to ensure that the powers of inspectors and constables appointed under that Act as regards the enforcement of EU obligations will be available after exit day in respect of obligations under retained EU law.
Regulations 3 to 6 amend subordinate legislation so far as is necessary to update cross-references to retained EU direct law, to provide for functions of the Scottish Ministers on or after exit day, to provide for certificates of competence in animal welfare matters on or after that day, and for related matters.

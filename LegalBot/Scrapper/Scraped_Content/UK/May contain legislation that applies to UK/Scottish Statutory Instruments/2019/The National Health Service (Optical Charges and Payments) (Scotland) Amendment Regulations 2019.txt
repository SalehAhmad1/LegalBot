(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Optical Charges and Payments) (Scotland) Regulations 1998 (“the principal Regulations”) which provide for payments to be made by means of a voucher system in respect of costs incurred by certain categories of persons in connection with the supply, replacement and repair of optical appliances.
Regulation 6 amends regulation 13 of the principal Regulations to require suppliers of optical appliances, unless a voucher has been issued by a Health Board, to make claims for payment by means of electronic communication.
Regulation 6 also inserts paragraphs (2B), (2C) and (2D) into regulation 13 of the principal Regulations which provide that where a voucher has been issued by a Health Board, suppliers of optical appliances can make claims for payment either by means of electronic communication or on a duly completed voucher to the responsible authority.
Regulation 8 amends regulation 18 of the principal Regulations to require suppliers replacing or repairing optical appliances, unless a voucher has been issued by a Health Board, to make claims for payment by means of electronic communication.
Regulation 8 inserts paragraphs (2B), (2C) and (2D) into regulation 18 of the principal Regulations which provide that where a voucher has been issued by a Health Board, suppliers replacing or repairing optical appliances can make claims for payment either by means of electronic communication or on a duly completed voucher to the responsible authority.
Regulation 8 also makes amendments to regulation 18(2)(b)(i) of the principal Regulations and inserts regulation 18(2C)(b)(i) into the principal Regulations to require suppliers, when making and keeping a written record of the replacement or repair of an optical appliance, to include a description of the loss or damage, the nature of any repair including details of any parts replaced, the date on which the patient signed the declarations and undertaking referred to in regulation 16(4) of the principal Regulations, and the date of the replacement or repair.
Regulation 12 makes a saving provision. Where, before these Regulations come into force, a replacement or repair of an optical appliance has been carried out and a supplier has made a written record of that replacement or repair, regulation 18(2)(b)(i) of the principal Regulations will continue to apply to that written record as it applied immediately before the coming into force of these Regulations.
Regulations 4, 5 7, 9, 10 and 11 make minor and consequential amendments to the principal Regulations.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

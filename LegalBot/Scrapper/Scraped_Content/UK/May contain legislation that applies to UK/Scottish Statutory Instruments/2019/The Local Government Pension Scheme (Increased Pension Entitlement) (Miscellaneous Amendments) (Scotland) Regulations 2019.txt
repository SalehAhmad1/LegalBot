(a)
the existing Order for that tax year,

at the date of his death was entitled to a pension under the scheme,

48.—(1) Subject to paragraphs (3), (4) and (5), a person to whom regulations 46 to 49 apply is entitled to an Increased Pension Entitlement calculated in accordance with paragraph (2).
(2) The Increased Pension Entitlement is an amount equal to the basic rate of a pension which, if that pension had been increased by the amount of any increase under section 1 of the 1971 Act and the existing Orders, would result in an annual amount being paid to the person in relation to the tax year 2019-20 which equals the Protected Sum.
(3) Where the person's pension is terminated under the scheme, the person is not entitled to receive any payment of an amount of the Increased Pension Entitlement in respect of any period after the date on which the pension is terminated.
(4) Where a person's pension is not payable to the person, the person is not entitled to receive any payment of an amount of the Increased Pension Entitlement during any period when the pension is not payable to the person.

(7) In this regulation—

“Protected Sum” is the amount equal to the annual amount of the GMP-related payment for the tax year 2019-20, and

Increased Pension Entitlement – further provision
49.—(1) An Increased Pension Entitlement is payable by the relevant administering authority and shall be paid out of the appropriate fund.
(2) An Increased Pension Entitlement is payable for life and shall be discharged by payments at such reasonable intervals as the administering authority may, in their discretion, determine except that payment on account of an Increased Pension Entitlement may be delayed, in whole or in part, pending the determination of any question as to the liability of the administering authority in respect thereof, including any question as to the continuance of that liability.
(3) Neither the Increased Pension Entitlement nor any portion of that entitlement may be commuted for a lump sum.”.

S.I. 2019/546.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Local Government Superannuation (Scotland) Regulations 1987 (“the 1987 Regulations”), the Local Government Pension Scheme (Benefits, Membership and Contributions) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 (“the 2008 Regulations”) and the Local Government Pension Scheme (Transitional Provisions and Savings) (Scotland) Regulations 2014 to authorise the payments made by administering authorities between 12 November 1979 and 8 April 2019 of annual increases to certain persons who are entitled to a guaranteed minimum pension. They also introduce a new entitlement to an Increased Pension Entitlement (“IPE”).
Section 5 of the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 (“the 1971 Act”) requires pensions authorities to increase annually pensions to which that Act applies. The 1971 Act is modified by sections 59 and 59A of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 (“the 1975 Act”). Pensions authorities pay annual increases on pensions in accordance with the annual Pensions (Increase) Review Orders (“the annual PIROs”) which are made under section 59 of the 1975 Act. The combined effect of section 59(5) of the 1975 Act, Directions by the Treasury made under section 59A of the 1975 Act and relevant provisions of the annual PIROs is that the amount of increase payable by a pensions authority under the annual PIROs is reduced by the amount equal to the rate of the GMP which is paid by the Department of Work and Pensions (“DWP”).
Contracting-out of the state second pension ended from 5 April 2016, with the introduction of the single tier state pension. Schemes were required to undertake a reconciliation exercise to check the contracting-out data held against that held by HMRC.
This reconciliation exercise has been undertaken and any inconsistencies corrected.
These Regulations provide that going forward GMP-related overpayments are converted into an Increased Pension Entitlement (“IPE”) and therefore become part of the members' entitlement under the scheme.
These Regulations amend the Local Government Pension Scheme (Transitional Provisions and Savings) (Scotland) Regulations 2014 with the effect that references to the Local Government Pension Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 1998 (“the 1998 Regulations”) as saved are to be read as if the following amendments were made.
Regulation 163 of the 1998 Regulations, regulation U3 of the 1987 Regulations and regulation 46 of the 2008 Regulations define a GMP-related payment as a payment made by the administering authority applying the annual PIROs as if no reduction fell to be made in relation to the person's GMP.
Regulation 164 of the 1998 Regulations, regulation U4 of the 1987 Regulations and regulation 47 of the 2008 Regulations authorise the past payment of GMP-related payments. This provision has effect from 12 November 1979 until 8 April 2019. Paragraph (2) of each of these regulations provides that where an administering authority has made such payments to an affected pensioner, it may not recover them.
Regulation 165 of the 1998 Regulations, regulation U5 of the 1987 Regulations and regulation 48 of the 2008 Regulations set out the entitlement to IPE. Although entitlement to IPE begins on 8 April 2019, the effect of the 1971 Act is that annual increases must apply to IPE from the beginning date of the pension (usually the day after the person's date of retirement). IPE is therefore defined as the amount a pension would have to be at the beginning date of a pension in order for that amount, after annual increases have been applied under the annual PIROs, to equal the GMP-related payment for the tax year 2019-20. The effect is that for the tax year 2019–20 the IPE that the affected pensioner will receive is equal to the GMP-related payment he or she would have received were the administering authority to apply the 2019 PIRO as if no reduction fell to be made in relation to the person's GMP. Thereafter, IPE will continue to be increased in line with the annual PIROs although future PIROs will no longer be applied as if no reduction fell to be made.

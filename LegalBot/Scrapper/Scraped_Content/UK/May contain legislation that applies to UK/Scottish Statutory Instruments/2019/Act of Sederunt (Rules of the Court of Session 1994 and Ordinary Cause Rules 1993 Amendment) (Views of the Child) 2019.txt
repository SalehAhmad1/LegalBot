SCHEDULE 8EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)
In this Note—
“the Council Regulation” means Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27th November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000;
“the Hague Convention” means the Convention defined in section 1(1) of the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985 and as set out in schedule 1 of that Act;
“the OCR” means the Ordinary Cause Rules 1993 in schedule 1 of the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1907;
“the RCS” means the Rules of the Court of Session 1994 in schedule 2 of Act of Sederunt (Rules of the Court of Session 1994) 1994;
“section 11 order” means an order under section 11 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.
This Act of Sederunt amends and supplements the court rules that apply to intimation to the child and seeking the views of the child by way of a court form in family actions where a section 11 order is sought. This Act of Sederunt inserts into the rules a new form to be used for intimation and the seeking of the child’s views (Form 49.8A in the RCS and Form F9 in the OCR). It also sets out the procedure to be followed when making use of these forms. Paragraph 2 amends Chapters 49 (family actions) and 70 (applications under the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985) and the Appendix (forms) of the RCS. Paragraph 3 amends Chapters 33 (family actions), 33A (civil partnership actions) and Appendix 1 (forms) of the OCR.
Application of this Act of Sederunt
Paragraph 4 provides that the amendments made by this Act of Sederunt–
(a)
subject to sub-paragraph (b), do not apply to family actions or civil partnership actions commenced before 24th June 2019;
(b)
apply to family actions and civil partnership actions in which a minute after final decree is lodged on or after 24th June 2019 seeking a section 11 order or the variation or recall of a section 11 order, regardless of when the action was commenced;
(c)
do not apply to child welfare reporters appointed before 24th June 2019.
Amendments to the RCS
Paragraph 2(3) inserts a new rule 49.8A into the RCS. This requires the pursuer to set out in the summons the reasons why it is either appropriate or inappropriate to send Form 49.8A to the child and to apply by motion for either (i) a warrant for intimation and the seeking of the child’s views in Form 49.8A; or (ii) the court to dispense with intimation and the seeking of the child’s views in Form 49.8A. In the former scenario, the pursuer must submit a draft Form 49.8A along with the summons and the court must be satisfied that this has been drafted appropriately. Rule 49.8A(6) specifies the particular rules that apply to the issuing of the Form 49.8A in the circumstances narrated.
Paragraph 2(5) inserts new rules 49.20 to 49.20D, which set out the particular procedure to be followed, depending on whether (i) the action is undefended (rule 49.20); (ii) the action is defended and a section 11 order is sought by the pursuer only (rule 49.20A); (iii) the action is defended and a section 11 order is sought by the defender only (rule 49.20B); (iv) the action is defended and a section 11 order is sought by both parties (rule 49.20C); or (v) the court orders a Form 49.8A to be sent to the child at any other time (rule 49.20D).
Rule 49.20D retains the existing statement, in similar terms, of the court’s duty not to grant any order unless an opportunity has been given for the views of the child to be obtained or heard. It also clarifies that where the court is considering making an interim section 11 order before the views of the child have been obtained, the court must consider whether, and if so how, to seek the child’s views before making the order.
Paragraphs 2(6) and (15)(e) make changes to rules that apply to an interlocutor appointing a child welfare reporter (rule 49.22(3) and Form 49.22).
Paragraph 2(7) amends rule 49.28 to remove actions for a section 11 order from the list of undefended family actions to which the rule does not apply. This makes it clear that rule 49.28 applies to undefended actions in which a section 11 order is sought. The change reflects current Court of Session practice, which is for affidavit evidence to be required.
Paragraph 2(8) amends rule 49.31 to make provision about cases where only the defender seeks a section 11 order. The amendments mirror the terms of new rule 49.8A.
Paragraph 2(9) amends rule 49.34 to provide for the views of the child to be obtained or heard in cases where the defender has entered appearance late.
Paragraphs 2(10) and (11) amend rule 49.41, and for rule 49.42 substitutes new rules, which apply to applications after decree in actions of divorce, dissolution, separation and declarator of nullity of marriage or civil partnership. The new rules remove the existing procedural distinction between contact orders and other types of section 11 orders, with the effect that all post-decree applications relating to section 11 orders will now be dealt with by minute. New rule 49.42 outlines the procedure for seeking the views of the child. This closely aligns with the procedure followed in principal proceedings.
Paragraph 2(12) amends rule 49.63, which applies to applications after decree in non-divorce and non-dissolution cases. Rule 49.63(3) provides that new rules 49.42 to 49.42C apply (with the necessary modifications) to the seeking of the child’s views in relation to a minute lodged in accordance with rule 49.63.
Paragraph 2(13) substitutes a new rule 70.16, which makes provision about intimation to a child and seeking the child’s views in respect of petitions for the return of a child under the Hague Convention where the Council Regulation applies.
Paragraph 2(15) omits Form 49.8-N, inserts new forms (Forms 49.8A, 49.8B and 49.8C) and amends Form 49.22. Paragraph 2(14) makes a consequential amendment to rule 70.17.
Amendments to the OCR
Paragraph 3 amends Chapters 33 and 33A of the OCR. As far as possible, this replicates the changes described above. The terminology and detail of certain provisions have been adapted where appropriate in order to align the new rules with sheriff court procedure.

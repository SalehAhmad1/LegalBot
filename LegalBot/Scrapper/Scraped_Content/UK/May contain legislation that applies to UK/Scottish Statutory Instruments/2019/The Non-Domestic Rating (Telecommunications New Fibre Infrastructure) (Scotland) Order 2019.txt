(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides that where telecommunications new fibre infrastructure, as defined in article 2, is installed on lands and heritages, separate entries are to be made in the valuation roll for the new fibre infrastructure and for the remainder of the lands and heritages. The effect is that the lands and heritages will be valued separately.
Article 3 makes consequential amendments to legislation that provides for aggregation of telecommunications entries in the valuation roll in some circumstances, so that separate entries are made for each of the lands and heritages specified in this Order.

16th May 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (General Dental Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2010 (the “2010 Regulations”). The 2010 Regulations set out arrangements which a Health Board may make with a dentist under section 25 of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 (the “1978 Act”). Dental care provided under these section 25 arrangements is known as “general dental services”.
These Regulations amend the 2010 Regulations to allow Health Boards to give certain dentists an additional designation as a “domiciliary care dentist” alongside the dentist’s existing work providing general dental services. The role of a domiciliary care dentist is to provide general dental services to care home residents.
Regulation 3 insert new definitions into the 2010 Regulations and makes modifications to existing definitions in connection with domiciliary care dentists.
Regulations 7 and 18 amend the 2010 Regulations to set out the process by which a dentist may request to become a domiciliary care dentist, the eligibility criteria to be applied and the procedure for deciding on that request.
The 2010 Regulations require Health Boards to maintain a “dental list”, of dentists who are eligible to perform general dental services in the Health Board’s area. Regulations 5, 6, 8, and 20 amend the 2010 Regulations to allow a dental list to record that a dentist is designated as a domiciliary care dentist. Regulation 9 to 15 provide for circumstances in which designation as a domiciliary care dentist on the dental list may be removed or refused.
Schedule 1 of the 2010 Regulations sets out the terms of service which dentists must follow when providing general dental service. Regulations 4 and 19 modify the way in which certain of the terms of service apply to domiciliary care dentists and introduce additional terms of service which apply to domiciliary care dentists.
Regulations 16 and 17 amend the 2010 Regulations to provide for payments to be made to domiciliary care dentists in connection with their work.
The 2010 Regulations require dentists to produce “patient information leaflets” and set out the information which the leaflet must contain. Regulations 21 and 22 amend the 2010 Regulations to remove from the list of information which these leaflets must include the dentist’s sex.

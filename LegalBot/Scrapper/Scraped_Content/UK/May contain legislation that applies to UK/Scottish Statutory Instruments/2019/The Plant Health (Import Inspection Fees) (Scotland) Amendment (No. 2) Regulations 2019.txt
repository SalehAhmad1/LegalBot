(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Plant Health (Import Inspection Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (“the principal Regulations”).
Regulation 2(2) makes amendments to definitions used in the principal Regulations.
Regulation 2(3) and (4) make changes to regulations 3 and 4 of the principal Regulations to make separate provision for the charging of (i) fees for plant health checks and (ii) fees for document and identity checks.
Regulation 2(5) substitutes schedule 1 of the principal Regulations which previously made provision for document and identity checks as well as for plant health checks. The new schedule 1 makes provision for fees for plant health checks only.
Article 13d of Council Directive 2000/29/EC (OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p.1) (“the Directive”) requires a Member State to ensure the collection of fees to cover the costs occasioned by the documentary checks, identity checks and plant health checks of certain imports of plants, plant products and other objects from third countries which are required by Article 13a(1) of the Directive. Pursuant to Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) 1756/2004 (OJ L 313, 12.10.2004, p.6), the European Commission notifies Member States of plants and plant products which should be subject to reduced inspection and of the rate of such inspection. Regulation 2(6) substitutes schedule 2 of the principal Regulations to take account of the most recent Commission Notification on reduced inspections rates as published on the following website:
https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_health_biosecurity/non_eu_trade/less_frequent_checks_en

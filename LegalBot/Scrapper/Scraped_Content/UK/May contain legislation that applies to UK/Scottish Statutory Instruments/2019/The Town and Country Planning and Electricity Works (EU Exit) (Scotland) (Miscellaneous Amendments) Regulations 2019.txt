EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(d) and (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the fields of environmental protection, town and country planning, electricity works, and hazardous substances.
Regulation 2 amends the Town and Country Planning (Development Planning) (Scotland) Regulations 2008; Regulation 3 amends the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2013; Regulation 4 amends the Town and Country Planning (Hazardous Substances) (Scotland) Regulations 2015; Regulation 5 amends the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017; and Regulation 6 amends the Electricity Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017. The amendments made by these Regulations ensure that references to the relevant European Union Directives are amended to be references to the relevant Directive as it had effect immediately before exit day. References to specific Articles of the relevant Directives, “Member States”, “Union Legislation” and other references which will become redundant or will no longer apply are updated.
No Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations, as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the definition of caravan in section 13(2) of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 (“the 1968 Act”).
Section 13 (twin-unit caravans) of the 1968 Act excepts from the meaning of “caravan” in Part 1 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 twin-unit structures designed or adapted for human habitation which are composed of not more than two sections separately constructed and designed to be assembled on site by bolts, clamps or other devices, which when assembled are physically capable of being moved by road from one place to another and whose dimensions exceed specified dimensions.
This Order substitutes larger dimensions into section 13(2) of the 1968 Act.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (Scotland) Regulations 2010 (S.S.I. 2010/177) (“the 2010 Regulations”). The 2010 Regulations implement Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (OJ No L 147, 31.5.2001, p.1) (“the EU TSE Regulation”).
The EU TSE Regulation has been subsequently updated and so these Regulations make consequential amendments to the 2010 Regulations and fix out of date references.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 2 of the 2010 Regulation (interpretation) so that the definitions of certain EU instruments are up to date.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 3 of the 2010 Regulations (appointment of competent authority) to provide that the Scottish Ministers are the competent authority for the purposes of paragraph (19) of schedule 7.
Regulation 5 amends regulation 15 of the 2010 Regulation (notices) to make provision for the serving of notices under that regulation.
Regulations 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 make consequential amendments to schedules 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 of the 2010 Regulations.
Regulation 9(10) inserts a new paragraph (19) into schedule 7 of the 2010 Regulations. This provides that the term “aged over 12 months”, when it appears in that schedule, means that the age of the animal in question has been determined in accordance with a method which has been approved by the Scottish Ministers.

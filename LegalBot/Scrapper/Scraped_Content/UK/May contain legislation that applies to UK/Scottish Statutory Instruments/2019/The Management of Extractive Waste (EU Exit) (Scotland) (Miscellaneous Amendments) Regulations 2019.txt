EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68) and paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16). These Regulations make amendments to legislation concerning the management of extractive waste. The amendments update out of date references to EU instruments which are no longer in force. The amendments also address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(d) and (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Part 2 makes amendments to the Management of Extractive Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2010. The amendments made ensure that references to the relevant European Union Directives are amended to replace out of date reference to EU law with either equivalent text or references to current EU instruments. References to EU instruments which are no longer in force are removed and, where appropriate, references to repealed EU instruments are replaced with references to current EU equivalents.
Part 3 makes amendments to the Management of Extractive Waste (Scotland) Regulations 2010 to remedy deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union by updating, replacing or removing EU references, including references to EU instruments, which will become redundant or will no longer be appropriate after exit day.
No Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations, as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

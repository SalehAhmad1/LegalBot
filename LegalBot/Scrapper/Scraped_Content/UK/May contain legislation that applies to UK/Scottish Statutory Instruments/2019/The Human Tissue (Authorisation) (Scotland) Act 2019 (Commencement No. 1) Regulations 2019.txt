(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring section 1 of the Human Tissue (Authorisation) (Scotland) Act 2019 (“the 2019 Act”) into force on 11 October 2019. They also partially commence sections 7 and 23 of the 2019 Act on that date.
Section 7 of the 2019 Act will insert a new section 6D (deemed authorisation for transplantation: adult) into the Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”). These Regulations commence section 7 of the 2019 Act only for the limited purpose of enabling the Scottish Minister to consult and then make regulations under section 6D(5) of the 2006 Act which will specify what is an excepted body part. Authorisation of donation for transplantation by an adult for an excepted body part will not be deemed.
Section 23 of the 2019 Act will insert new sections 16A to 16G into the 2006 Act. These Regulations commence section 23 only for the limited purpose of enabling consultation and then regulations to be made specifying Type A procedures and Type B procedures.

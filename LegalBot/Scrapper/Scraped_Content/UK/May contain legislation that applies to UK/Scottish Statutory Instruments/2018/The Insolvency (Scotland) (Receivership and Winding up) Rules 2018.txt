Taking possession and realisation of the company's assets

Realisation of the company's heritable property

(2) The liquidator may sell that part only with the concurrence of every such creditor unless the liquidator obtains a sufficiently high price to discharge every such security.

the taking of steps by a creditor to enforce the creditor's security over that part after the liquidator has intimated to the creditor an intention to sell it;

(2) This does not apply if either—
(a)
the transaction was entered into with the prior consent of the court; or

it is shown to the court's satisfaction that the transaction was for value, and that it was entered into by the liquidator without knowing, or having any reason to suppose, that the person concerned was an associate.

Special manager
[Note: a document required by the Act or these Rules must also contain the standard contents required as set out in Part 1.]
Application of this Chapter and interpretation
5.40.  This Chapter applies to applications for the appointment of a special manager by a liquidator and by a provisional liquidator (where one has been appointed), and so references to the liquidator are to be read as including a provisional liquidator.
Appointment and remuneration of special manager (section 177)
5.41.—(1) An application by the liquidator under section 177 for the appointment of a special manager must be supported by a report setting out the reasons for the application.
(2) The report must include the liquidator's estimate of the value of the business or property in relation to which the special manager is to be appointed.
(3) The court's order appointing the special manager must specify the duration of the special manager's appointment being one of the following—
(a)
for a fixed period stated in the order;
(b)
until the occurrence of a specified event; or
(c)
until the court makes a further order.
(4) The appointment of a special manager may be renewed by order of the court.
(5) The special manager's remuneration will be fixed from time to time by the court.
(6) The acts of the special manager are valid notwithstanding any defect in the special manager's appointment or qualifications.
Caution
5.42.—(1) The appointment of the special manager does not take effect until the person appointed has found (or, if the court allows, undertaken to find) caution for the appointment to be given to the applicant.
(2) A person appointed as special manager may find caution either specifically for a particular winding up, or generally for any winding up in relation to which that person may be appointed as special manager.
(3) The amount of the caution must be not less than the value of the business or property in relation to which the special manager is appointed, as estimated in the applicant's report under rule 5.41 which accompanied the application for appointment.
(4) When the special manager has found caution for the appointment to be given to the applicant that person must lodge with the court a certificate as to the adequacy of the caution.
(5) The cost of finding the caution must be paid in the first instance by the special manager; but—
(a)
where a winding-up order is not made, the special manager is entitled to be reimbursed out of the property of the company, and the court may order accordingly; and
(b)
where a winding-up order is made, the special manager is entitled to be reimbursed as an expense of the liquidation.
Failure to give or keep up caution
5.43.—(1) If the special manager fails to find the required caution within the time allowed for that purpose by the order of appointment, or any extension of that time that may be allowed, the liquidator must report the failure to the court, which may discharge the order appointing the special manager.
(2) If the special manager fails to keep up the caution, the liquidator must report the failure to the court, which may remove the special manager, and make such order as to expenses as it thinks just.
(3) If the court discharges the order appointing the special manager, or makes an order removing the special manager, the court must give directions as to whether any, and if so what, steps should be taken for the appointment of another special manager.
Accounting
5.44.—(1) The special manager must produce accounts, containing details of the special manager's receipts and payments, for the approval of the liquidator.
(2) The accounts must be for—
(a)
each 3 month period for the duration of the special manager's appointment; and
(b)
any shorter period ending with the termination of the special manager's appointment.
(3) When the accounts have been approved, the special manager's receipts and payments must be added to those of the liquidator.
Termination of appointment
5.45.—(1) The special manager's appointment terminates—
(a)
if the winding-up petition is dismissed; or
(b)
in a case where a provisional liquidator was appointed under section 135, if the appointment is discharged without a winding-up order having been made.
(2) If the liquidator is of the opinion that the appointment of the special manager is no longer necessary or beneficial for the company, the liquidator must apply to the court for directions, and the court may order the special manager's appointment to be terminated.
(3) The liquidator must make the same application if the creditors decide that the appointment should be terminated.CHAPTER 8

Further provisions about requests by a creditor or contributory for a public examination
5.48.—(1) A request by a creditor or contributory for a public examination does not require the support of concurring creditors or contributories if the requisitioning creditor's debt or, as the case may be, requisitioning contributory's shares, is sufficient alone under section 133(2).
(2) Before the liquidator makes the requested application, the creditor or contributory requesting the examination must deposit with the liquidator such sum (if any) as the liquidator determines is appropriate as caution for the expenses of the public examination (if ordered).

(4) However if the liquidator thinks the request is unreasonable, the liquidator may apply to the court for an order to be relieved from making the application.

Expenses of examination
5.51.  Where public examination of the examinee has been ordered by the court on a request by a creditor under rule 5.46 or by a contributory under rule 5.47, the court may order that some or all of the expenses of the examination are to be paid out of the deposit required under those rules, instead of as an expense of the liquidation.CHAPTER 9
Distribution of company's assets by the liquidator
Winding up commencing as voluntary
5.52.  In any winding up by the court which follows immediately on a voluntary winding up (whether members' voluntary or creditors' voluntary), such outlays and remuneration of the voluntary liquidator as the court may allow have the same priority as the outlays mentioned in rule 7.28(3)(a).
Saving for powers of the court (section 156)
5.53.—(1) The priority laid down by rule 7.27 is subject to the power of the court to make orders under section 156, where the assets are insufficient to satisfy the liabilities.

at the same time make a decision on any matter requiring to be specified under paragraph (4)(a) or (b).
(2) On accepting or rejecting, under paragraph (1), every claim submitted or deemed to have been re-submitted, the liquidator must, as soon as reasonably practicable, send a list of every claim so accepted or rejected (including the amount of each claim and whether it has been accepted or rejected) to every creditor known to the liquidator.

(2) Such entitlement to payment arises only in so far as the company has funds available to make that payment, having regard to rule 7.27 (order of priority in distribution).
Liabilities and rights of co-obligants
7.21.—(1) Where a creditor has an obligant bound to the creditor along with the company for the whole or part of the debt, the obligant is not freed or discharged from liability for the debt by reason of the dissolution of the company or the creditor's voting or drawing a dividend or assenting to or not opposing—
(a)
the dissolution of the company; or
(b)
any composition with creditors.
(2) Paragraph (3) applies where—
(a)
a creditor has had a claim accepted in whole or in part; and

(4) The obligant may require and obtain at the obligant's own expense from the creditor an assignation of the debt, on payment of the amount of the debt and on that being done may in respect of the debt submit a claim, and vote and draw a dividend, if otherwise legally entitled to do so.
(5) Paragraph (4) is without prejudice to any right, under any rule of law, of a co-obligant who has paid the debt.
(6) In this rule an “obligant” includes cautioner.
Amount which may be claimed generally
7.22.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this rule and rules 7.23 and 7.24, the amount in respect of which a creditor is entitled to claim is the accumulated sum of principal and any interest which is due on the debt as at the date on which the company went into liquidation.
(2) If a debt does not depend on a contingency but would not be payable but for the liquidation until after the date on which the company went into liquidation, the amount of the claim is to be calculated as if the debt were payable on the date on which the company went into liquidation but subject to the deduction of interest at the rate specified in paragraph (4) from that date until the date for payment of the debt.
(3) In calculating the amount of a creditor's claim, the creditor must deduct any discount (other than any discount for immediate or early settlement) which is allowable by contract or course of dealing between the creditor and the company or by the usage of trade.
(4) The rate of interest referred to in paragraph (2) is the official rate.
(5) Where the winding up was immediately preceded by an administration, the reference to the date on which the company went into liquidation in paragraph (1) and the second reference to that date in paragraph (2) are to be construed as references to the date the company entered administration.
Debts depending on contingency
7.23.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the amount which a creditor is entitled to claim is not to include a debt in so far as its existence or amount depends on a contingency.
(2) On an application by the creditor—
(a)
to the liquidator; or
(b)
if there is no liquidator, to the court,
the liquidator or court must put a value on the debt in so far as it is contingent.
(3) Where under paragraph (2) a value is put on the debt—
(a)
the amount in respect of which the creditor is then entitled to claim is to be that value but no more;
(b)
where the contingent debt is an annuity, a cautioner may not then be sued for more than that value.
(4) Any interested person may appeal to the court against a valuation under paragraph (2) by the liquidator, and the court may affirm or vary that valuation.
Secured debts
7.24.—(1) In calculating the amount of a secured creditor's claim the secured creditor is to deduct the value of any security as estimated by the secured creditor.
(2) If the secured creditor surrenders, or undertakes in writing to surrender, a security for the benefit of the company's assets, the secured creditor is not required to deduct the value of that security.
(3) The liquidator may, at any time after the expiry of 12 weeks from the date on which the company went into liquidation, require a secured creditor at the expense of the company's assets to discharge the security or convey or assign it to the liquidator on payment to the creditor of the value specified by the creditor.
(4) Where under paragraph (3) the liquidator makes payment to the creditor the amount in respect of which the creditor is then entitled to claim is to be any balance of the creditor's debt remaining after receipt of such payment.
(5) In calculating the amount of the claim of a creditor whose security has been realised the creditor must deduct the amount (less the expenses of realisation) which the creditor has received, or is entitled to receive, from the realisation.
Claims in foreign currency
7.25.—(1) A creditor may state the amount of the creditor's claim in a currency other than sterling where—
(a)
the creditor's claim is constituted by decree or other order made by a court ordering the company to pay to the creditor a sum expressed in a currency other than sterling; or
(b)
where it is not so constituted, the creditor's claim arises from a contract or bill of exchange in terms of which payment is, or may be required to be, made by the company to the creditor in a currency other than sterling.
(2) Where under paragraph (1) a claim is stated in a currency other than sterling the liquidator must convert it into sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the liquidator by reference to the exchange rates prevailing in the London market at the close of business on the date on which the company went into liquidation.
CHAPTER 5
Official rate of interest
Specified rate of interest
7.26.—(1) This rule specifies the rate of interest for the purpose of section 189(4)(a) and (5) (rate of interest used in calculating the official rate of interest for the purposes of provisions of the Act).
(2) The rate specified is the rate of interest on a sheriff court decree or extract under section 9 of the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Extracts Act 1892 M7 as it may be amended by section 4 of the Administration of Justice (Scotland) Act 1972 M8.

Saving for powers of the court (section 156)

(2) Nothing in those rules—

(b)

Estate to be distributed in respect of the accounting periods
[Note: Where in this rule provision is applicable to the provisional liquidator the term provisional liquidator is used.]
7.31.—(1) The liquidator must make up accounts of the liquidator's intromissions with the company's assets in respect of each accounting period.
(2) In this Rule, “accounting period” is to be construed as follows—
(a)
the first accounting period is the period of 6 months beginning with the date on which the liquidator is appointed (subject to paragraph (3));
(b)
the second accounting period is the period of 6 months beginning with the end of the first accounting period; and
(c)
any subsequent accounting period is the period of 12 months beginning with the end of the last accounting period except that—
(i)
where the liquidator and the liquidation' committee agree; or
(ii)
where there is no liquidation committee, the court determines,
the accounting period is to be such other period beginning with the end of the last accounting period as may be agreed or, as the case may be determined, it is to be that other period.
(3) Where a provisional liquidator is appointed under section 135 the first accounting period is the period of 6 months beginning with the date on which the provisional liquidator is appointed.
(4) An agreement or determination under paragraph (2)(c)—
(a)
may be made in respect of one or more than one accounting period;
(b)
may be made before the beginning of the accounting period in relation to which it has effect and, in any event, is not to have effect unless made before the day on which such accounting period would, but for the agreement or determination, have ended;
(c)
may provide for different accounting periods to be of different durations; and
(d)
may vary the time periods mentioned in—
(i)
rule 7.16(1) and paragraphs (10) and (11) of this rule;
(ii)
rule 7.19(1)(a) and (5); and
(iii)
rule 7.35 (contents of notice to be delivered to creditors owed small debts etc.).
(5) Accounting periods are unaffected by any—
(a)
recall of the appointment of a provisional liquidator (prior to a winding up order being made);
(b)
termination of the appointment of a provisional liquidator and appointment of a liquidator (including an interim liquidator) on the making of a winding up order;
(c)
change in the provisional liquidator or liquidator.
(6) Subject to the following provisions of this rule, the liquidator must, if the funds of the company's assets are sufficient and after making an allowance for future contingencies, pay under rule 7.32 (payment of dividends) a dividend out of the company's assets to the creditors in respect of each accounting period.
(7) The liquidator may pay—
(a)
the expenses of the liquidation mentioned in rule 7.28(3)(a), other than the liquidator's own remuneration, at any time;
(b)
the preferential debts within the meaning of section 386 at any time but only with the consent of the liquidation committee or, if there is no liquidation committee, of the court.
[F5(7A) Where section 174A of the Act applies, paragraph (7)(b) shall have effect as if the reference to preferential debts included references to moratorium debts and priority pre-moratorium debts within the meaning given by section 174A. ]
(8) If the liquidator—
(a)
is not ready to pay a dividend in respect of an accounting period; or
(b)
considers it would be inappropriate to pay such a dividend because the expenses of doing so would be disproportionate to the amount of the dividend,
the liquidator may postpone such payment to a date not later than the time for payment of a dividend in respect of the next accounting period.
(9) Where an appeal is taken under rule 7.19(5) against the acceptance or rejection of a creditor's claim, the liquidator must, at the time of payment of dividends and until the appeal is determined, set aside an amount which would be sufficient, if the determination in the appeal were to provide for the claim being accepted in full, to pay a dividend in respect of that claim.
(10) Where a creditor—
(a)
has failed to produce evidence in support of a claim earlier than 8 weeks before the end of an accounting period on being required by the liquidator to do so under rule 7.18; and
(b)
has given a reason for such failure which is acceptable to the liquidator,
the liquidator must set aside, for such time as is reasonable to enable the creditor to produce that evidence or any other evidence that will enable the liquidator to be satisfied under rule 7.18, an amount which would be sufficient, if the claim were accepted in full, to pay a dividend in respect of that claim.
(11) Where a creditor submits a claim to the liquidator later than 8 weeks before the end of an accounting period but more than 8 weeks before the end of a subsequent accounting period in respect of which, after making allowance for contingencies, funds are available for the payment of a dividend, the liquidator must, if accepting the claim in whole or in part, pay to the creditor—
(a)
the same dividend or dividends as has or have already been paid to creditors of the same class in respect of any accounting period or periods; and
(b)
whatever dividend may be payable to that creditor in respect of the said subsequent accounting period.
(12) Paragraph (11)(a) is without prejudice to any dividend which has already been paid.
(13) In the declaration of and payment of a dividend, no payments are to be made more than once by virtue of the same debt.

(a)
allocated to a creditor which is not cashed or uplifted; or

(a)
in paying any dividend to that creditor, make such adjustment to it as the liquidator considers necessary to take account of that revaluation; or
(b)

Unclaimed dividends
7.33.—(1) Any person, producing evidence of that person's right, may apply to the Accountant of Court to receive a dividend deposited under section 193(2), if the application is made not later than 7 years after the date of deposit.
(2) If the Accountant of Court is satisfied of the person's right to the dividend, the Accountant of Court must authorise the bank or institution in which the deposit was made to pay to the person the amount of that dividend and of any interest which has accrued on the dividend.
(3) The Accountant of Court is, at the expiry of 7 years from the date of deposit of any unclaimed dividend or unapplied balance under section 193(2), to hand over the deposit receipt or other voucher relating to the dividend or balance to the Secretary of State.
(4) Where under paragraph (3) the Accountant of Court hands over the deposit receipt or other voucher, the Secretary of State is entitled to payment of the amount due (principal and interest) from the bank or institution in which the deposit was made.
Small debts
7.34.—(1) A creditor is deemed to have submitted a claim for the purposes of adjudication of entitlement to and payment of a dividend but not otherwise where—

the debt is a small debt;
(b)
notice has been delivered to the creditor under rule 7.35; and
(c)
the creditor has not advised the liquidator that the debt is incorrect or not owed in response to the notice.
(2) In this rule “small debt” means a debt (being the total amount owed to a creditor) which does not exceed £1,000 (which amount is prescribed for the purposes of paragraph 13A M11 of schedule 8 of the Act and paragraph 18A of schedule 9 of the Act M12).

(a)
Chapters 2 to 11 apply where the Act or these Rules require a decision to be made by a qualifying decision procedure or permit a decision to be made by the deemed consent procedure; and
(b)
Chapter 12 applies to company meetings.
CHAPTER 2
Decision procedures
[Note: a document required by the Act or these Rules must also contain the standard contents required as set out in Part 1.]
Interpretation
8.2.—(1) In these Rules—
“decision date” means—
(a)
in the case of a decision to be made at a meeting, the date of the meeting;
(b)
in the case of a decision to be made either by a decision procedure other than a meeting or by the deemed consent procedure, the date the decision is to be made or deemed to have been made,
and a decision falling within paragraph (b) is to be treated as made at 23:59 on the decision date;
“decision procedure” means a qualifying decision procedure as prescribed by rule 8.3;
“electronic voting” includes any electronic system which enables a person to vote without the need to attend at a particular location to do so;
“physical meeting” means a meeting where the creditors are invited to be present together at the same place (whether or not it is possible to attend the meeting without being present at that place) M1;
“virtual meeting” means a meeting where persons who are not invited to be physically present together may participate in the meeting including communicating directly with all the other participants in the meeting and voting (either directly or via a proxy-holder);

Schedule 8 is introduced by section 411(2) which provides that without prejudice to the generality of in particular rule 411(1), rules may contain any such provision as is specified in schedule 8. Paragraph 8A(1)(a) of schedule 8 provides in particular that rules may contain provision about the making of decisions by creditors and contributories including provision prescribing particular procedures by which creditors and contributories make decisions.

the notice delivered to creditors in accordance with rule 8.8 must give them any necessary information as to how to access the voting system including any password required;

any necessary information as to how to access the virtual meeting including any telephone number, access code or password required; and
(b)
a statement that the meeting may be suspended or adjourned by the chair of the meeting (and must be adjourned if it is so resolved at the meeting).
Physical meetings
8.6.—(1) A request for a physical meeting under section 246ZE(3) may be made before or after the notice of the decision procedure or deemed consent procedure has been delivered, but must be made not later than 5 business days after the date on which the convener delivered the notice of the decision procedure or deemed consent procedure unless these Rules provide to the contrary.
(2) It is the convener's responsibility to check whether any requests for a physical meeting are submitted before the deadline and if so whether in aggregate they meet or surpass one of the thresholds requiring a physical meeting under section 246ZE(7).
(3) Where the prescribed proportion of creditors requires a physical meeting the convener must summon the meeting by giving notice which complies with rule 8.8 so far as applicable and which must also contain a statement that the meeting may be suspended or adjourned by the chair of the meeting (and must be adjourned if it is so resolved at the meeting).
(4) In addition, the notice under paragraph (3) must inform the creditors that as a result of the requirement to hold a physical meeting the original decision procedure or the deemed consent procedure is superseded.
(5) The convener must send the notice under paragraph (3) not later than 3 business days after one of the thresholds requiring a physical meeting has been met or surpassed.
(6) The convener—
(a)
may permit a creditor to attend a physical meeting remotely if the convener receives a request to do so in advance of the meeting; and
(b)
must include in the notice of the meeting a statement explaining the convener's discretion to permit remote attendance.
(7) In this rule, attending a physical meeting “remotely” means attending and being able to participate in the meeting without being in the place where the meeting is being held.
(8) For the purpose of determining whether the thresholds under section 246ZE(7) are met, the convener must calculate the value of the creditor's debt by reference to rule 8.31.
Deemed consent
[Note: the deemed consent procedure cannot be used to make a decision on remuneration of any person, or where the Act, these Rules or any other legislation or court order requires a decision to be made by a decision procedure.]
8.7.—(1) This rule makes further provision about the deemed consent procedure to that set out in section 246ZF M3.
(2) A notice seeking deemed consent must, in addition to the requirements of section 246ZF comply with the requirements of rule 8.8 so far as applicable and must also contain—
(a)
a statement that in order to object to the proposed decision a creditor must have delivered a notice, stating that the creditor so objects, to the convener not later than the decision date together with a statement of claim and documentary evidence of debt in accordance with these Rules failing which the objection will be disregarded;
(b)
a statement that it is the convener's responsibility to aggregate any objections to see if the threshold is met for the decision to be taken as not having been made; and
(c)
a statement that if the threshold is met the deemed consent procedure will terminate without a decision being made and if a decision is sought again on the same matter it will be sought by a decision procedure.
(3) In this rule, the threshold is met where the appropriate number of relevant creditors (as defined in section 246ZF(7)) have objected to the proposed decision.
(4) For the purpose of aggregating objections, the convener may presume the value of relevant creditors' claims to be the value of claims by those creditors who, in the convener's view, would have been entitled to vote had the decision been sought by a decision procedure in accordance with this Part, even where those creditors had not already met the criteria for such entitlement to vote.
(5) Rules 8.31(2) (calculation of voting rights), 8.32 (calculation of voting rights: authorised deposit-taker) and 8.33 (procedure for admitting creditors' claims for voting) apply to the admission or rejection of a claim for the purpose of the convener deciding whether or not an objection should count towards the total aggregated objections.
(6) A decision of the convener on the aggregation of objections under this rule is subject to appeal under rule 8.35 as if it were a decision under Chapter 8 of this Part.

9.1.—(1) This Part applies in any case where a proxy is given in relation to a meeting or insolvency proceedings under the Act or these Rules, or where a corporation authorises a person to represent it.
(2) References in this Part to “the chair” are to the chair of the meeting for which a specific proxy is given or at which a continuing proxy is exercised.
Specific and continuing proxies
9.2.—(1) A proxy is a document made by a creditor, member or contributory which directs or authorises another person (a “proxy-holder”) to act as the representative of the creditor, member or contributory at a meeting, or meetings, by speaking, voting, abstaining, or proposing resolutions.
(2) A proxy may be either—
(a)
a specific proxy which relates to a specific meeting; or
(b)
a continuing proxy for the insolvency proceedings.
(3) A specific proxy must—
(a)
direct the proxy-holder how to act at the meeting by giving specific instructions; or
(b)
authorise the proxy-holder to act at the meeting without specific instructions; or
(c)
contain both direction and authorisation.
(4) A proxy is to be treated as a specific proxy for the meeting which is identified in the proxy unless it states that it is a continuing proxy for the insolvency proceedings.
(5) A continuing proxy must authorise the proxy-holder to attend, speak, vote or abstain, or to propose resolutions without giving the proxy-holder any specific instructions.
(6) A continuing proxy may be superseded by a proxy for a specific meeting or withdrawn by a written notice to the office-holder.
(7) A creditor, member or contributory may appoint more than one person to be proxy-holder but if so—
(a)
their appointment is as alternates; and
(b)
only one of them may act as proxy-holder at a meeting.
(8) The proxy-holder must be an individual.
Blank proxy
9.3.—(1) A blank proxy is a document which—
(a)
complies with the requirements in this rule; and
(b)
when completed with the details specified in paragraph (3) will be a proxy as described in rule 9.2.
(2) A blank proxy must state that the creditor, member or contributory named in the document (when completed) appoints a person who is named or identified as the proxy-holder of the creditor, member or contributory.
(3) The specified details are—
(a)
the name and address of the creditor, member or contributory;
(b)
either the name of the proxy-holder or the identification of the proxy-holder (e.g. the chair of the meeting);
(c)
a statement that the proxy is either—
(i)
for a specific meeting, which is identified in the proxy; or
(ii)
a continuing proxy for the insolvency proceedings; and
(d)
if the proxy is for a specific meeting, instructions as to the extent to which the proxy-holder is directed to vote in a particular way, to abstain or to propose any resolution.
(4) When it is delivered, a blank proxy must not have inserted in it—
(a)
the name or description of any person as proxy-holder or as a nominee for the office holder; or
(b)
instructions as to how a person appointed as proxy-holder is to act.
(5) A blank proxy must have a note to the effect that the proxy may be completed with the name of the person or the chair of the meeting who is to be proxy-holder.
Use of proxies
9.4.—(1) A proxy for a specific meeting must be delivered to the chair at or before the meeting.
(2) A continuing proxy must be delivered to the office-holder and may be exercised at any meeting which begins after the proxy is delivered.
(3) A proxy may be used at the resumption of the meeting after an adjournment, but if a different proxy is given for use at a resumed meeting, that proxy must be delivered to the chair at or before the resumed meeting.
(4) Where a specific proxy directs a proxy-holder to vote for or against a resolution for the nomination or appointment of a person as office-holder, the proxy-holder may, unless the proxy states otherwise, vote for or against (as the proxy-holder thinks fit) a resolution for the nomination or appointment of that person jointly with another or others.
(5) A proxy-holder may propose a resolution which is one on which the proxy-holder could vote if someone else proposed it.
(6) Where a proxy gives specific directions as to voting, this does not, unless the proxy states otherwise, prohibit the proxy-holder from exercising discretion as to how to vote on a resolution which is not dealt with by the proxy.
(7) The chair may require a proxy used at a meeting to be the same as or substantially similar to the blank proxy delivered for that meeting or to a blank proxy previously delivered which has been completed as a continuing proxy.
Use of proxies by the chair
9.5.—(1) Where a proxy appoints the chair (however described in the proxy) as proxy-holder the chair may not refuse to be the proxy-holder.
(2) Where the office-holder is appointed as proxy-holder but another person acts as chair of the meeting, that other person may use the proxies as if that person were the proxy-holder.
(3) Where, in a meeting of creditors in a creditors' voluntary winding up or a winding up by the court, the chair holds a proxy which requires the proxy-holder to vote for a particular resolution and no other person proposes that resolution the chair must propose it unless the chair considers that there is good reason for not doing so.
(4) If the chair does not propose such a resolution, the chair must as soon as reasonably practicable after the meeting deliver a notice of the reason why that was not done to the creditor, member or contributory.
Right of inspection and delivery of proxies
9.6.—(1) A person attending a meeting is entitled, immediately before or in the course of the meeting, to inspect proxies or any statement of claim and documentary evidence of debt delivered to the chair or to any other person in accordance with the notice convening the meeting.

Proxy-holder with financial interest
9.7.—(1) A proxy-holder must not vote for a resolution which would—
(a)
directly or indirectly place the proxy-holder or any associate of the proxy-holder in a position to receive any remuneration, fees or expenses from the company's assets; or
(b)
fix or change the amount of or the basis of any remuneration, fees or expenses receivable by the proxy-holder or any associate of the proxy-holder out of the company's assets.
(2) However, a proxy-holder may vote for a resolution described in paragraph (1) if the proxy specifically directs the proxy-holder to vote in that way.
(3) Where an office-holder is appointed as proxy-holder and that proxy is used under rule 9.5(2) by another person acting as chair, the office-holder is deemed to be an associate of the person acting as chair.

[Note: a document required by the Act or these Rules must also contain the standard contents required as set out in Part 1.]
Notice requiring office-holder to attend the creditors' committee (receivership: section 68(2))
[Note: in a receivership section 68(2) enables the creditors' committee to require the receiver to attend the committee or provide the committee with information.]
10.22.—(1) This rule applies where a committee in a receivership resolves under section 68(2) to require the attendance of the receiver.
(2) The notice delivered to the office-holder requiring the receiver's attendance must be—
(a)
accompanied by a copy of the resolution; and
(b)
authenticated by a member of the committee.
(3) A member's representative may authenticate the notice for the member.
(4) The meeting at which the receiver's attendance is required must be fixed by the committee for a business day, and must be held at such time and place as the receiver determines.
(5) Where the receiver so attends, the committee may elect one of their number to be chair of the meeting in place of the receiver or the appointed person.
Office-holder's obligation to supply information to the committee (winding up)
10.23.—(1) This rule applies in relation to a creditors' voluntary winding up and a winding up by the court.
(2) The liquidator must deliver a report to every member of the liquidation committee containing the information required by paragraph (3)—
(a)
not less than once in every period of 6 months (unless the committee agrees otherwise); and
(b)
when directed to do so by the committee.
(3) The required information is a report setting out—
(a)
the position generally in relation to the progress of the insolvency proceedings; and
(b)
any matters arising in connection with them to which the office-holder considers the committee's attention should be drawn.
(4) The liquidator must, as soon as reasonably practicable after being directed by the committee—
(a)
deliver any report directed under paragraph (2)(b);
(b)
comply with a request by the committee for information.
(5) However the liquidator need not comply with such a direction where it appears to the office-holder that—
(a)
the direction is frivolous or unreasonable;
(b)
the cost of complying would be excessive, having regard to the relative importance of the information; or
(c)
there are insufficient assets to enable the liquidator to comply.
(6) Where the committee has come into being more than 28 days after the appointment of the liquidator, the liquidator must make a summary report to the members of the committee of what actions the liquidator has taken since the liquidator's appointment, and must answer such questions as they may put to the liquidator relating to the liquidator's conduct of the proceedings so far.
(7) A person who becomes a member of the committee at any time after its first establishment is not entitled to require a report under this rule by the liquidator of any matters previously arising, other than a summary report.
(8) Nothing in this rule disentitles the committee, or any member of it, from having access to the liquidator's sederunt book, or from seeking an explanation of any matter within the committee's responsibility.
CHAPTER 6
Miscellaneous
[Note: a document required by the Act or these Rules must also contain the standard contents required as set out in Part 1.]
Expenses of members etc.
10.24.—(1) The office-holder must pay, as an expense of the insolvency proceedings, the reasonable travelling expenses directly incurred by members of the committee or their representatives in attending the committee's meetings or otherwise on the committee's business.
(2) The requirement for the office-holder to pay the expenses does not apply to a meeting of the committee held within 6 weeks of a previous meeting, unless the meeting is summoned by the office-holder.
Dealings by committee members and others: winding up
10.25.—(1) This rule applies in a creditors' voluntary winding up and a winding up by the court to a person who is, or has been in the preceding 12 months—
(a)
a member of the committee;
(b)
a member's representative; or
(c)
an associate of a member, or of a member's representative.
(2) Such a person must not enter into a transaction as a result of which that person would—
(a)
receive out of the company's assets any payment for services given or goods supplied in connection with the liquidation;
(b)
obtain a profit from the liquidation; or
(c)
acquire any part of the company's assets.
(3) However such a transaction may be entered into—
(a)
with the prior sanction of the committee, where it is satisfied (after full disclosure of the circumstances) that the person will be giving full value in the transaction;
(b)
with the prior permission of the court; or
(c)
if that person does so as a matter of urgency, or by way of performance of a contract in force before the date on which the company went into liquidation, and that person obtains the court's permission for the transaction, having applied for it without undue delay.
(4) Neither a member nor a representative of a member who is to participate directly or indirectly in a transaction may vote on a resolution to sanction that transaction.
(5) The court may, on the application of an interested person—
(a)
set aside a transaction which appears to it to be contrary to this rule; and
(b)
make such other order about the transaction as it thinks just, including an order requiring a person to whom this rule applies to account for any profit obtained from the transaction and compensate the insolvent estate for any resultant loss.
(6) The court will not make an order under the previous paragraph in respect of an associate of a member of the committee or an associate of a member's representative, if satisfied that the associate or representative entered into the relevant transaction without having any reason to suppose that in doing so the associate or representative would contravene this rule.
(7) The costs of the application are not payable as an expense of the liquidation unless the court orders otherwise.
Dealings by committee members and others: receivership
10.26.—(1) This rule applies in a receivership.
(2) Membership of the committee does not prevent a person from dealing with the company provided that a transaction is in good faith and for value.
(3) The court may, on the application of an interested person—
(a)
set aside a transaction which appears to it to be contrary to this rule; and
(b)
make such other order about the transaction as it thinks just including an order requiring a person to whom this rule applies to account for any profit obtained from the transaction and compensate the company for any resultant loss.
Formal defects
10.27.  The acts of a creditors' committee or a liquidation committee are valid notwithstanding any defect in the appointment, election or qualifications of a member of the committee or a committee member's representative or in the formalities of its establishment.
Special rule for winding up by the court: functions vested in the court
10.28.  At any time when the functions of a committee in a winding up by the court are vested in the court under section 142(5), requirements of the Act or these Rules about notices to be delivered, or reports to be made, to the committee by the liquidator do not apply, otherwise than as enabling the committee to require a report as to any matter.

Continuation of creditors' committee
[Note: paragraph 83(8)(f) of schedule B1 makes provision for the liquidation committee to continue where the administration is followed by a creditors' voluntary winding up.]
10.29.—(1) This rule applies where—
(a)
a winding-up order has been made by the court on the application of the administrator under paragraph 79 of schedule B1 M3;
(b)
the court makes an order under section 140(1) appointing the administrator as the liquidator; and
(c)
a creditors' committee was in existence immediately before the winding-up order was made.
(2) The creditors' committee shall continue in existence after the date of the order as if appointed as a liquidation committee under section 142 M4.
(3) However, subject to rule 10.8(3)(a), the committee cannot act until—
(a)
the minimum number of persons required by rule 10.3 have agreed to act as members of the liquidation committee (including members of the former creditors' committee and any other who may be appointed under rule 10.8); and
(b)

a statement that the former creditors' committee is continuing in existence;

PERMISSION TO ACT AS DIRECTOR ETC. OF COMPANY WITH A PROHIBITED NAME (SECTION 216)
[Note: a document required by the Act or these Rules must also contain the standard contents required as set out in Part 1.]
Preliminary
12.1.  The rules in this Part—
(a)
relate to permission required under section 216 (restriction on re-use of name of company in insolvent liquidation) for a person to act as mentioned in section 216(3) in relation to a company with a prohibited name;
(b)
prescribe the cases excepted from that provision, that is to say, in which a person to whom the section applies may so act without that permission; and
(c)
apply to all windings up to which section 216 applies.
Application for permission under section 216(3)
12.2.  At least 14 days' notice of any application for permission to act in any of the circumstances which would otherwise be prohibited by section 216(3) must be given by the applicant to the Secretary of State, who may—
(a)
appear at the hearing of the application; and
(b)
whether or not appearing at the hearing, make representations.
Power of court to call for liquidator's report
12.3.  When considering an application for permission under section 216, the court may call on the liquidator, or any former liquidator, of the liquidating company for a report of the circumstances in which the company became insolvent and the extent (if any) of the applicant's apparent responsibility for its doing so.
First excepted case
12.4.—(1) This rule applies where—
(a)
a person (“the person”) was within the period mentioned in section 216(1) a director, or shadow director, of an insolvent company that has gone into insolvent liquidation; and
(b)
the person acts in all or any of the ways specified in section 216(3) in connection with, or for the purposes of, the carrying on (or proposed carrying on) of the whole or substantially the whole of the business of the insolvent company where that business (or substantially the whole of it) is (or is to be) acquired from the insolvent company under arrangements—
(i)
made by its liquidator, or
(ii)
made before the insolvent company entered into insolvent liquidation by an office-holder acting in relation to it as administrator, receiver or supervisor of a CVA.
(2) The person will not be taken to have contravened section 216 if prior to that person acting in the circumstances set out in paragraph (1) a notice is, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (3),—
(a)
given by the person, to every creditor of the insolvent company whose name and address—
(i)
is known by that person, or
(ii)
is ascertainable by that person on the making of such enquiries as are reasonable in the circumstances; and
(b)
published in the Gazette.
(3) The notice referred to in paragraph (2)—
(a)
may be given and published before the completion of the arrangements referred to in paragraph (1)(b) but must be given and published no later than 28 days after their completion;
(b)
must contain—
(i)
identification details for the company,
(ii)
the name and address of the person,
(iii)
a statement that it is the person's intention to act (or, where the insolvent company has not entered insolvent liquidation, to act or continue to act) in all or any of the ways specified in section 216(3) in connection with, or for the purposes of, the carrying on of the whole or substantially the whole of the business of the insolvent company,
(iv)
the prohibited name or, where the company has not entered into insolvent liquidation, the name under which the business is being, or is to be, carried on which would be a prohibited name in respect of the person in the event of the insolvent company entering insolvent liquidation,
(v)
a statement that the person would not otherwise be permitted to undertake those activities without the leave of the court or the application of an exception created by Rules made under the Insolvency Act 1986,
(vi)
a statement that breach of the prohibition created by section 216 is a criminal offence, and
(vii)
a statement as set out in rule 12.5 of the effect of issuing the notice under rule 12.4(2);
(c)
where the company is in administration, has a receiver appointed or is subject to a CVA,—
(i)
the date that the company entered administration, had a receiver appointed or a CVA approved (whichever is the earliest), and
(ii)
a statement that the person was a director of the company on that date; and
(d)
where the company is in insolvent liquidation,—
(i)
the date that the company entered insolvent liquidation, and
(ii)
a statement that the person was a director of the company during the 12 months ending with that date.
(4) Notice may in particular be given under this rule—
(a)
prior to the insolvent company entering insolvent liquidation where the business (or substantially the whole of the business) is, or is to be, acquired by another company under arrangements made by an office-holder acting in relation to the insolvent company as administrator, receiver or supervisor of a CVA (whether or not at the time of the giving of the notice the person is a director of that other company); or
(b)
at a time when the person is a director of another company where—
(i)
the other company has acquired, or is to acquire, the whole, or substantially the whole, of the business of the insolvent company under arrangements made by its liquidator, and
(ii)
it is proposed that after the giving of the notice a prohibited name should be adopted by the other company.
(5) Notice may not be given under this rule by a person who has already acted in breach of section 216.
Statement as to the effect of the notice under rule 12.4(2)
12.5.  The statement as to the effect of the notice under rule 12.4(2) must be as set out below—
“Section 216(3) of the Insolvency Act 1986 lists the activities that a director of a company that has gone into insolvent liquidation may not undertake unless the court gives permission or there is an exception in the Insolvency Rules made under the Insolvency Act 1986. (This includes the exceptions in Part 12 of the Insolvency (Scotland) (Receivership and Winding up) Rules 2018.) These activities are—
(a)
acting as a director of another company that is known by a name which is either the same as a name used by the company in insolvent liquidation in the 12 months before it entered liquidation or is so similar as to suggest an association with that company;
(b)
directly or indirectly being concerned or taking part in the promotion, formation or management of any such company; or
(c)
directly or indirectly being concerned in the carrying on of a business otherwise than through a company under a name of the kind mentioned in (a) above.
This notice is given under rule 12.4 of the Insolvency (Scotland) (Receivership and Winding up) Rules 2018 where the business of a company which is in, or may go into, insolvent liquidation is, or is to be, carried on otherwise than by the company in liquidation with the involvement of a director of that company and under the same or a similar name to that of that company.
The purpose of giving this notice is to permit the director to act in these circumstances where the company enters (or has entered) insolvent liquidation without the director committing a criminal offence and in the case of the carrying on of the business through another company, being personally liable for that company's debts.

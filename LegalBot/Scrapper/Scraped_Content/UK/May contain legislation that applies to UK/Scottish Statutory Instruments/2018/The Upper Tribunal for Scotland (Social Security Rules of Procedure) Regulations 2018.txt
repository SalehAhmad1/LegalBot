17.— [F1(1)]  The Upper Tribunal may at any stage of the proceedings, on its own initiative or on application by one or more of the parties, make an order with a view to preventing or restricting the public disclosure of any aspect of those proceedings so far as it considers necessary in the interests of justice or in order to protect the Convention rights of any person.
[F2(2) The Upper Tribunal may at any stage of proceedings, on its own initiative or on the request of one or more of the parties, give a direction prohibiting disclosure of a document or information to a person (“the recipient”) if—

(3) If a party considers that the Upper Tribunal should give a direction under paragraph (2) prohibiting the disclosure of a document or information to a person (“the recipient”), the party must provide to the Upper Tribunal the document or information, and the reason the party is requesting that it be withheld, so that the Upper Tribunal may decide whether the document or information should be disclosed to the recipient or should be subject of a direction under paragraph (2).
(4) The Upper Tribunal must conduct proceedings as appropriate in order to give effect to a direction given under paragraph (2).
(5) If the Upper Tribunal gives a direction under paragraph (2) which prevents disclosure to a party who has a representative, or any other person acting on their behalf, the Upper Tribunal may give a direction that the document or information be disclosed to that representative or person if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that—
(a)
disclosure to the representative or person would be in the interests of the party, and
(b)
the representative or person will act in accordance with paragraph (6).
(6) Documents or information disclosed to a representative or person in accordance with a direction under paragraph (5) must not be disclosed either directly or indirectly to any other person without the Upper Tribunal’s consent.]

(2) The Upper Tribunal may give an order that a hearing, or part of it, is to be held in private if the Upper Tribunal considers that restricting access to the hearing is justified—
(a)
in the interests of public order;
(b)
in order to protect a person's right to respect for their private and family life;
(c)
in order to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information;
(d)
in order to avoid serious harm to the public interest; or
(e)
because to hold it in public would prejudice the interests of justice.
(3) Where a hearing, or any part of it, is to be held in private, the Upper Tribunal may determine who is entitled to attend the hearing or part of it.
(4) The Upper Tribunal may give an order excluding from any hearing, or part of it—
(a)
any person whose conduct the Upper Tribunal considers is disrupting or is likely to disrupt the hearing;
(b)
any person whose presence the Upper Tribunal considers is likely to prevent another person from giving evidence or making submissions freely; or
(c)
any person where the purpose of the hearing would be defeated by the attendance of that person.
(5) The Upper Tribunal may give a direction excluding a witness from a hearing until that witness gives evidence.
(6) When publishing a decision in terms of rule 27(4) (notice of decisions and reasons) following a hearing which was held wholly or partly in private, the Upper Tribunal must, so far as practicable, ensure that the decision does not disclose information which was referred to in a part of the hearing that was held in private.
Hearings in a party's absence
26.  If a party fails to attend a hearing, the Upper Tribunal may proceed with the hearing if the Upper Tribunal—

considers that it is in the interests of justice to proceed with the hearing.

(a)
a decision notice stating the Upper Tribunal's decision; and
(b)
notification of any rights of appeal against the decision and the time and manner in which such rights of appeal may be exercised.
(3) If the Upper Tribunal does not provide written reasons for a decision, a party may request written reasons, within the period of 14 days beginning with the day of the decision.
(4) The Upper Tribunal may publish any of its decisions if it considers it in the public interest so to do, with the manner of publication also at the discretion of the Upper Tribunal.
Reviews
28.—(1) The Upper Tribunal may at its own instance or at the request of a party review a decision (except an excluded decision) made by it if it considers it necessary in the interests of justice to do so and on review it may confirm, set aside, or set aside and re-decide the decision.
(2) An application under paragraph (1) must be made in writing within the period of 14 days beginning with the day of the decision and must state the reasons for making the application.
(3) The Upper Tribunal must send a copy of the application to any other party involved in the proceedings within the period of 10 working days beginning with the day of receipt of the application.
(4) The review must be decided as soon as reasonably practicable by the Upper Tribunal, with insofar as practicable the same members that decided the case, or where this is not practicable with members selected by the President.
(5) A notice of the decision on a review under paragraph (1) must as soon as reasonably practicable be sent by the Upper Tribunal to each party.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make the Upper Tribunal for Scotland Social Security Rules of Procedure 2018 regulating the practice and procedure to be followed in the Upper Tribunal for Scotland when dealing with proceedings relating to Scottish Ministers' exercise of functions under the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 or regulations made under it which confer a right of appeal. All other proceedings are subject to the Upper Tribunal for Scotland Rules of Procedure 2016, unless specific rules of procedure are made which apply to the proceedings.
These Rules will apply until such time as the powers of the Scottish Civil Justice Council and the Court of Session to make Tribunal Rules (under paragraph 13(2) and (5) of schedule 9 of the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014) come into force and are exercised.
The Upper Tribunal for Scotland, set up by section 1 of the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014, hears appeals from the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland, which is divided into chambers based on the subject-matter of the cases before it. In terms of section 46(3) of that Act, an appeal to the Upper Tribunal requires first the permission of the First-tier Tribunal, or, if that permission is refused, the permission of the Upper Tribunal. An appeal may be on a point of law only in terms of section 46(2) of that Act.
A Partial Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared and placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Copies may be obtained from the Scottish Government Social Security Directorate.

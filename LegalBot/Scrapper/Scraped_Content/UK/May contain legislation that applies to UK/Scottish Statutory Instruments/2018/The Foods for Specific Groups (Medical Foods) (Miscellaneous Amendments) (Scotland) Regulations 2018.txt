EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision to enforce, in Scotland, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/128 supplementing Regulation (EU) 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the specific compositional and information requirements for food for special medical purposes.
Regulation 3 restricts the application of the Foods for Special Medical Purposes (Scotland) Regulations 2000 to food for medical purposes developed to satisfy the needs of infants and, in relation to food that is labelled or placed on the market before 22 February 2019.
Regulation 4 amends the Foods for Specific Groups (Scotland) Regulations 2016 which enforce the provisions of Regulation (EU) 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provisions of food intended for infants and young children, food for special medical purposes and total diet replacement for weight control.
In addition, regulation 2 amends the Foods Intended for Use in Energy Restricted Diets for Weight Reduction Regulations 1997, to remove redundant text in respect of labelling requirements.
A full business and regulatory impact assessment of the effect these Regulations will have on the costs for the business sector has been prepared and placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.

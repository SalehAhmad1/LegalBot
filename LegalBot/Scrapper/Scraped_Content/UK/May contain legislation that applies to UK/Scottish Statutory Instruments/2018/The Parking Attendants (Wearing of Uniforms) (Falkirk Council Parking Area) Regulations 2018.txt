(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations prescribe functions during the exercise of which a parking attendant must wear such uniform as the Scottish Ministers may determine (regulation 2).
The requirement to wear a uniform is contained in section 63A(4) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Section 63A itself applies to Greater London only but by virtue of the Road Traffic (Permitted Parking Area and Special Parking Area) (Falkirk Council) Designation Order 2018 that section is modified so as to apply to the parking area designated by that Order. Accordingly, parking attendants exercising the prescribed functions within that parking area are required to wear a uniform when doing so.

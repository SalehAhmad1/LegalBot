(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Disabled Persons (Badges for Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (“the principal Regulations”). The principal Regulations deal with what is known as the “Blue Badge Scheme” in relation to disabled persons and motor vehicles.
Regulation 4(2)(f) and (g) of the principal Regulations prescribes categories of disabled person who may be issued with a blue badge based on having been certified by an independent mobility assessor as unable to walk, or virtually unable to walk, on either a permanent or temporary basis.
Regulation 4(2A) of the principal Regulations prescribes a category of disabled person who may be issued with a blue badge based on the person having a mental disorder as defined by section 328 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. Regulation 4(2A)(c) provides that such persons may be issued with a blue badge if certified by an independent mobility assessor as lacking awareness of danger from traffic which is likely to compromise their safety, or the safety of other persons, during journeys. This lack of awareness can be on either a permanent basis or, subject to certain qualifications, a temporary basis.
Regulation 2 amends the principal Regulations as follows—
regulation 2(1B) is substituted to provide that an independent mobility assessor for the purposes of the certification required by regulation 4(2)(f) or (g), or regulation 4(2A)(c), must—
a)
be a member of one of the professions to which section 60(2) of the Health Act 1999 applies; and
b)
be recognised by the local authority as having the expertise necessary to assess applicants for a blue badge based on the criteria set out in regulation 4(2)(f) or (g), or regulation 4(2A)(c).
regulation 4(2A) is amended to remove the requirement that applicants described in that regulation must be in receipt of one of the benefits listed in paragraph (2A)(b).

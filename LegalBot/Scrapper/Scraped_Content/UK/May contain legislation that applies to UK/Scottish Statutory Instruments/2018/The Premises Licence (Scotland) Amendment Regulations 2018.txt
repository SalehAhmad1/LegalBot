”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Premises Licence (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (“the 2007 Regulations”).
Section 20 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 (“the 2005 Act”) requires that an application for an alcohol premises licence be accompanied by an operating plan, a layout plan and any certificates required under section 50(1) of the 2005 Act. Section 179 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 (“the 2010 Act”) amended section 20 of the 2005 Act to require that a disabled access and facilities statement must also be included with such applications.
Regulation 2(2) of these Regulations inserts a regulation 7 into the 2007 Regulations detailing that a disabled access and facilities statement is to be in the form set out in schedule 6 of the 2007 Regulations.
Regulation 2(3) and the schedule of these Regulations insert a schedule 6 into the 2007 Regulations. This provides a template of what the disabled access and facilities statement should contain.

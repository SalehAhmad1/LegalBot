(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order lists by name all those bodies appearing to the Scottish Ministers to be recognised bodies for the purposes of section 214(2)(a) and (b) of the Education Reform Act 1988.
Recognised bodies are:
(a)
universities, colleges or other bodies which are authorised by Royal Charter or by or under Act of Parliament to grant degrees; or
(b)
other bodies for the time being permitted by any body falling within paragraph (a) to act on their behalf in the granting of degrees.
This Order updates and replaces the list of bodies contained in the Education (Recognised Bodies) (Scotland) Order 2007 as amended by the Education (Recognised Bodies) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009, which are revoked.
There are omitted from the schedule of this Order a number of bodies that were listed in previous Orders but which have merged with other bodies. A number of new bodies, that were not listed in previous Orders, have been included in the schedule, as those bodies now appear to the Scottish Ministers to fall within either (a) or (b) above. The schedule also takes account of name changes since the Education (Recognised Bodies) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009 was made.

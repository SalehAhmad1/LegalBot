(2) A contractor who wishes to opt out permanently or temporarily must give to the Health Board in writing a preliminary opt out notice which must state the reasons for wishing to opt out.
(3) As soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event within the period of 7 days beginning on the date on which the preliminary opt out notice was received by the Health Board, the Health Board must enter into discussions with the contractor concerning the support which the Health Board may give the contractor, or concerning other changes which the Health Board or the contractor may make, which would enable the contractor to continue to provide the additional service and the Health Board and the contractor must use reasonable endeavours to achieve this aim.
(4) The discussions mentioned in sub‑paragraph (3) must be completed within the period of 10 days beginning with the date on which the preliminary opt out notice was received by the Health Board or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter.

opt out permanently; or

(e)
in the case of a temporary opt out, the desired duration of the opt out.
(7) Where a contractor has given two previous temporary opt out notices within the period of 3 years ending with the date of the service of the latest opt out notice (whether or not the same additional service is concerned), the latest opt out notice will be treated as a permanent opt out notice (even if the opt out notice says that the contractor wishes to opt out temporarily).
(8) Paragraph 2 applies following the giving of a temporary opt out notice and paragraph 3 applies following the giving of a permanent opt out notice, or a temporary opt out notice which is treated as a permanent opt out notice pursuant to sub‑paragraph (7).
Temporary opt outs and permanent opt outs following temporary opt outs
2.—(1) As soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event within the period of 7 days beginning on the date on which a temporary opt out notice mentioned in paragraph 1(5) is received, the Health Board must—
(a)
approve the opt out notice and specify in accordance with sub‑paragraphs (3) and (4) the date on which the temporary opt out is to commence and the date that it is to come to an end (“the end date”); or
(b)
reject the opt out notice in accordance with sub‑paragraph (2),
and must notify the contractor of its decision as soon as possible, including reasons for its decision.
(2) A Health Board may reject the temporary opt out notice on the ground that the contractor—
(a)
is providing additional services to patients other than its own registered patients or enhanced services; or
(b)
has no reasonable need temporarily to opt out having regard to its ability to deliver the additional service.
(3) The date specified by the Health Board for the commencement of the temporary opt out is to be, wherever reasonably practicable, the date requested by the contractor in its opt out notice.
(4) Before determining the end date, the Health Board must make reasonable efforts to reach agreement with the contractor.
(5) Where the Health Board approves an opt out notice, the contractor’s obligation to provide the additional service specified in the notice will be suspended from the date specified by the Health Board in its decision under sub‑paragraph (1), and is to remain suspended until the end date unless—
(a)
the contractor and the Health Board agree in writing an earlier date, in which case the suspension is to come to an end on that date;
(b)
the Health Board specifies a later date under sub‑paragraph (6), in which case the suspension is to end on that date;
(c)
sub‑paragraph (7) applies and the contractor refers the matter to the NHS dispute resolution procedure (or, where applicable in the case of a non‑NHS contract, commences court proceedings), in which case the suspension will end—
(i)
where the outcome of the dispute is to uphold the decision of the Health Board, on the day after the date of the decision of the adjudicator or, as the case may be, the court;
(ii)
where the outcome of the dispute is to overturn the decision of the Health Board, 28 days after the decision of the adjudicator or, as the case may be, the court; or

(7) Where the Health Board considers that—
(a)
the contractor will be unable to satisfactorily provide the additional service at the end of the temporary opt out; and
(b)
it would not be appropriate to exercise its discretion under sub‑paragraph (6) to specify a later date on which the temporary opt out is to come to an end or the contractor does not agree to a later date,
the Health Board may notify the contractor in writing at least 28 days before the end date that a permanent opt out will follow the temporary opt out.
(8) Where a Health Board notifies the contractor under sub‑paragraph (7) that a permanent opt out will follow a temporary opt out, the permanent opt out must take effect immediately after the end of the temporary opt out.
(9) A contractor who has temporarily opted out may, at least three months prior to the end date, notify the Health Board in writing that it wishes to opt out permanently of the additional service in question.

(16) Where after the end date the assessment panel notifies the Health Board that it does not approve the Health Board’s proposed decision to refuse a permanent opt out, the Health Board must notify the contractor in writing of this fact as soon as is reasonably practicable.
(17) A temporary opt out or a permanent opt out commences, and a temporary opt out ends, at 0800 hours on the relevant day unless—
(a)
the day is not a working day, in which case the opt out will take effect on the next working day at 0800 hours; or

(9) As soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event within 7 days of the date on which the Health Board served a notice under sub‑paragraph (8), the Health Board must enter into discussions with the contractor concerning the support that the Health Board may give to the contractor or other changes which the Health Board or the contractor may make in relation to the provision of the additional service until C day.

(a)
terminating the contract with immediate effect; or
(b)
instructing it to terminate the sub-contracting arrangements that give rise to the breach with immediate effect, and if it fails to comply with the instruction, the Health Board must serve a notice in writing on the contractor terminating the contract with immediate effect.
Termination by the Health Board: remedial notices and breach notices
106.—(1) Where a contractor has breached the contract other than as specified in paragraphs 101 to 105 and the breach is capable of remedy, the Health Board must, before taking any action it is otherwise entitled to take by virtue of the contract, serve a notice on the contractor requiring it to remedy the breach (“a remedial notice”).

protect itself from material financial loss,
be no less than 28 days from the date that notice is given.

(a)
the date upon which the contract is to be terminated; and

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations consolidate the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2004 and set out, for Scotland, the framework for general medical services contracts under section 17J of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 (“the Act”).
Part 2 of the Regulations prescribes the conditions which, in accordance with section 17L(1) of the Act, must be met by a contractor before the Health Board may enter into a general medical services contract with it.
Part 3 of the Regulations prescribes the procedure for pre-contract dispute resolution, in accordance with section 17O(1) of the Act.
Part 4 of the Regulations sets out the procedures, in accordance with section 17O(2) of the Act, by which a contractor may elect to be regarded as a health service body for any purposes of section 17A of the Act and modifies section 17A in relation to such a person.
Part 5 of (and schedules 1 to 6, 7 and 8 to) the Regulations prescribe the terms which, in accordance with sections 17K and 17N of the Act, must be included in a general medical services contract (in addition to those contained in the Act).
The prescribed terms include terms relating to—
(a)
the type and duration of the contract (regulations 14 to 17);
(b)
the services to be provided (regulations 18, 19 and 21 to 23 and schedule 1), the manner in which they are to be provided (Part 1 of schedule 6) and the procedures for opting out of additional (regulation 20 and schedule 2);
(c)
the issuing of medical certificates (regulation 25 and schedule 4);
(d)
finance, fees and charges (regulations 26 to 28 and schedule 5);
(e)
patient registration and removal, lists closures and assignments (schedule 6, Part 2 and schedule 7);
(f)
prescribing and dispensing (schedule 6, Part 3);
(g)
the conditions to be met by those who perform services or are employed or engaged by the contractor (schedule 6, Part 4);
(h)
patient records, the provision of information and rights of entry (schedule 6, Part 5 and schedule 8);
(i)
complaints (schedule 6, Part 6);
(j)
procedures for dispute resolution (schedule 6, Part 7); and
(k)
procedures for variation and termination of contracts (schedule 6, Part 8).
Part 6 of the Regulations prescribes functions for area medical committees.
Part 7 of the Regulations makes transitional provision for persons continuing to provide out of hours services, notwithstanding the repeal of the National Health Service (Primary Medical Services Section 17C Agreements)(Scotland) Regulations 2004.
Part 8 of (and schedules 9 and 10 to) the Regulations amends or revokes provisions of existing legislation in consequence of the making of these Regulations.

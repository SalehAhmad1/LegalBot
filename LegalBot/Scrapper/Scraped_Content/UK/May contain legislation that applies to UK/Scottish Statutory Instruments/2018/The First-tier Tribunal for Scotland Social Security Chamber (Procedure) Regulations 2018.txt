(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014 (“the 2014 Act”) creates a new structure for tribunals dealing with devolved matters under the judicial leadership of the Lord President of the Court of Session as head of the Scottish Tribunals. It provides for a First-tier Tribunal and an Upper Tribunal for Scotland, with these being known, collectively, as the Scottish Tribunals. The 2014 Act provides for the First-tier Tribunal to be divided into chambers in order to deal with the various matters falling within the jurisdiction of the Scottish Tribunals. One of those chambers is the Social Security Chamber, which is brought into being by the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland (Chambers) Amendment Regulations 2018 (S.S.I. 2018/349).
These Regulations provide for the rules of procedure which are to apply to the Social Security Chamber, as set out in the schedule of the Regulations. Paragraph 4 of schedule 9 of the 2014 Act enables the Scottish Ministers to make Tribunal Rules until such time as the provisions conferring responsibility on the Scottish Civil Justice Council and the Court of Session for the making of Tribunal Rules are commenced.

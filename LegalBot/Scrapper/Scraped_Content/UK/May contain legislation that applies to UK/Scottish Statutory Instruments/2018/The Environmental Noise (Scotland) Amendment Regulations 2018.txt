(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Environmental Noise (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (S.S.I. 2006/465) (“the 2006 Regulations”) to implement Commission Directive (EU) 2015/996 establishing common noise assessment methods according to Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 168, 1.7.2015, p.1).
These Regulations provide for new common noise assessment methods as set out in Annex II to Directive 2002/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise (OJ L 189, 18.7.2002, p.12), the text of which was replaced by Commission Directive (EU) 2015/996.
Regulation 2(1) amends the definition of “Directive” in regulation 3 of the 2006 Regulations to narrate amendments made to Directive 2002/49/EC, including by Commission Directive (EU) 2015/996.
The Regulations also make an amendment to regulation 5(2)(b) of the 2006 Regulations to clarify the intended application of the supplementary noise indicators defined in schedule 3 of those Regulations.

(2) If the Scottish Ministers are required under paragraph (1) to make a transfer payment in circumstances where such a payment in respect of an eligible person is also provided and used in accordance with regulation M1 of the 2011 Regulations (member's right to transfer or buy-out), the Scottish Ministers must do so in accordance with the time limit specified in regulation M5 of those Regulations as if the reference in that regulation to an application were a reference to a notice referred to in paragraph (1).
(3) If the Scottish Ministers are required under paragraph (1) to make a transfer payment in circumstances where such a payment in respect of an eligible person is also provided and used in accordance with regulation 2.F.1 or 3.F.1 of the 2013 Regulations (rights to transfer value payments), the Scottish Ministers must do so in accordance with the time limit specified in, as the case may be, regulation 2.F. 4 or 3.F.4 of those Regulations as if the reference in regulation 2.F.4 or (as the case may be) 3.F.4 to an application were a reference to a notice referred to in paragraph (1).

(6) If disciplinary or court proceedings are commenced against the eligible person within 12 months after leaving pensionable employment and it appears to the Scottish Ministers that the proceedings may lead to all or part of that person's rights to benefits being forfeited in accordance with regulation 21, the Scottish Ministers may defer doing what is required of them under this regulation to carry out the requirements of that eligible person until 3 months after the conclusion of those proceedings (including any proceedings on appeal) where that date is later than the date which would otherwise apply by virtue of paragraph (2) to (4) above.

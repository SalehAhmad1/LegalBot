(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Self-directed Support (Direct Payments) (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (“the principal Regulations”) which make provision about direct payments under the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013.
Regulation 2 amends the principal Regulations so that a local authority may not carry out a means test or require a direct payment user to make a contribution where the direct payment relates to support to a carer under section 24 of the Carers (Scotland) Act 2016. “Carer” for the purposes of the Carers (Scotland) Act 2016 includes both adult carers and young carers, within the meaning of that Act.

16th April 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service Superannuation Scheme (Scotland) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”) to correct an error in those regulations. The error in the 2017 Regulations was that regulation 7 had an effective date of 1st April 2015 but all regulations introduced by that regulation did not share that effective date. The amendment makes clear that regulation 7 of the 2017 Regulations has an effective date of 1st April 2015 only in respect of those regulations introduced by it that share that same effective date. These Regulations also make some other changes to dates from which certain of the 2017 Regulations are to have effect.

following an appeal, an award of universal credit or assistance of a kind specified in regulation 11 is made that is a backdated award, and
(ii)
had that award been made before the original determination, a determination that the individual is entitled to the grant in connection with the child would have been made instead.
(2) In making a determination required by sub-paragraph (1) the Scottish Ministers are to use—
(a)
the information provided in the application that led to the original determination, and
(b)
any other information they have obtained in connection with that application.

(a)
having applied the rules in sub-paragraph (3) in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) it appears to the Scottish Ministers from information available to them that none of the circumstances described in rules (a) to (d) are true in the case of the individuals in question, or

(14) If a member who is paying APCs is granted Tier 1 or Tier 2 benefits in relation to the pension account to which the arrangements are attached before the end of the period the arrangements made under paragraph (1) were due to cease (“the APC period”), that member is to be treated as having paid the contributions required from the date the member is granted Tier 1 or Tier 2 benefits, up to the end of the APC period and the additional pension bought by those contributions is to be included in the active member's pension account for the year of leaving.
(15) If a member fails to pay all the additional contributions due under arrangements made under paragraph (1), and paragraph (14) does not apply to that member, the member's active member pension account must be credited with additional pension of an amount calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers.
(16) Where an arrangement is one to which regulation 15(5) (employer contributions during absences) applies, [F3an] application by an active member to make the arrangements under this regulation must be made before the expiry of a period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the person returns to work or such longer period as the Scheme employer allows.
(17) Where an active member to whom regulation 11(4) applies (contributions during absence from work) has an arrangement under this regulation which was entered into prior to the commencement of the period of absence, the APCs under that arrangement—
(a)
must be paid by the member during any period of child-related leave, which for this regulation includes any period of additional maternity leave, additional adoption leave,[F4parental bereavement leave] or shared parental leave during which the member receives no pensionable pay;
(b)
must be paid by the member during any period of reserve forces service leave where regulation 13(1) (contributions during reserve forces service leave) applies;
(c)
must be paid by the member during any period of absence for illness or injury where regulation 14(1)(contributions during absence or illness etc.) applies; and
(d)
must be paid by the member during any period of absence of the description in regulation 11(4)(b) or (c) (contributions during absence from work).
(18) Where the member elects to pay an APC to cover the amount of pension that would otherwise have accrued but for an absence of a description mentioned in regulation 11(4)(b) or (c), the amount of pension that would have accrued during that absence shall be calculated on the pensionable pay the member would have received but for the absence or in accordance with guidance to be issued by the Scottish Ministers where the amount of pensionable remuneration cannot readily be determined.

1971 c.56.Additional voluntary contributions
17.—(1) An active member may enter into arrangements to pay additional voluntary contributions (“AVCs”) or to contribute to shared cost additional voluntary contribution arrangements (“SCAVCs”) in respect of an employment.
(2) The arrangements mentioned in paragraph (1) must be a scheme established under an agreement between the appropriate administering authority and a body approved for the purposes under the Finance Act 2004 M1 (“the AVC provider”), registered in accordance with that Act and administered in accordance with the Pensions Act 2004 M2.
(3) Where an active member wishes to make contributions to an arrangement under paragraph (1), the active member or the AVC provider authorised by the member to act on the member's behalf must specify in a written notice given both to the appropriate administering authority and the member's Scheme employer, if the member is not employed by the administering authority—
(a)
the percentage of pensionable pay or the amount that the member wishes to contribute from pensionable pay in respect of an employment in each pay period (but see paragraph (4)); and
(b)
whether any of the contributions are to be used to provide life assurance benefits payable upon death in service as an active member and, if so, the proportion or amount to be so used.
(4) Where a member is paying AVCs for life assurance and pensionable pay in a pay period, net of any deductions made by the Scheme employer, is less than the AVC due, the member may pay the contribution due by way of a payment direct to the AVC provider or to the Scheme employer for onward transmission to that body in order to ensure that the life assurance cover continues.
(5) A member may vary the amount specified in, or cease contributing to, an arrangement by a further written notice given to the member's Scheme employer and appropriate administering authority by the member or by the AVC provider authorised by the member to act on the member's behalf.
(6) If a member draws benefits under regulation 29(1), F1...(4), (5), [F2(6), (8),] (11) to (13) (retirement benefits), regulation 34(1) (early payment of retirement pension on ill-health grounds: active members), regulation 36 (early payment of retirement pension on ill-health grounds: deferred members) or, if a member who draws benefits under regulation [F329(7)] (flexible retirement) makes an election to draw the realisable value in the AVC arrangement at the same time, that member must notify the appropriate administering authority that the realisable value under arrangements made under this regulation—
(a)
is to be taken in full or in part by the member as a lump sum, and where only part is taken as a lump sum, the member must specify the amount to be so taken; and
(b)
to the extent that the realisable value has not been taken as a lump sum, it is to be used—
(i)
to purchase additional pension under the Scheme, the amount of which is to be determined by the administering authority in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers; or
(ii)
to the extent that it has not been used to purchase additional pension under the Scheme, to purchase an annuity [F4or additional pension] from one or more insurance companies (within the meaning of section 275 of the Finance Act 2004).
(7) Where a member chooses to take some or all of the benefits referred to in paragraph (6) in the form of a lump sum, that sum forms part of the total amount referred to in regulation 32(2) (election for lump sum instead of a pension).
(8) Where a member chooses to take their benefits as an UFPLS, this may be paid from AVC funds, subject to the AVC provider's terms and conditions M3[F5; and this provision applies also to members of Earlier Schemes].
(9) A person with an arrangement under paragraph (1) who becomes a deferred member of the Scheme is entitled to a deferred AVC account with the AVC provider.
(10) Where a member aggregates a deferred member's pension account or a deferred refund account with an active member's pension account, the realisable value in any deferred AVC account must be transferred to an arrangement under this regulation and the member may make an election to make further payments to the arrangement.
(11) An active member may, by notifying his or her administering authority in writing, transfer into the member's AVC scheme constituted under this regulation the accumulated value of any other AVC scheme to which the member has subscribed.
(12) If—
(a)
an active member who is paying contributions to an AVC or SCAVC for the purpose of life assurance dies;
(b)
an active member who is paying contributions to an AVC or SCAVC other than for the purpose of life assurance dies;
(c)
a deferred member dies and has a deferred AVC account attached to the deferred member's pension account;
(d)
a pension credit member who has been awarded a share of a member's AVC account dies before drawing benefits; or
(e)
a member who has made an election under paragraph (6)(b)(ii) dies before the annuity [F6or additional pension] has been purchased,
the appropriate administering authority shall, at its absolute discretion, decide that any life assurance sum due under sub-paragraph (a), and the realisable value of any arrangement under sub-paragraphs (b) to (e), should be paid to or for the benefit of the member's nominee, personal representatives or any person appearing to the authority to have been a relative or dependent of the member.
(13) Where a member had attained the age of 75 at the date of death, any tax chargeable under section 206 of the Finance Act 2004 M4 (special lump sum death benefits charge) is to be deducted from the payment due under paragraph (12).
(14) Regulations 67 (first instance decisions) and 86 (forfeiture of pension rights after conviction for employment-related offences) do not apply in relation to an annuity purchased under paragraph (6)(b)(ii) and regulation 19(1)(b) (exclusion of rights to return of contributions) does not apply to any AVCs paid by the member.

18.—(1) If a person's qualifying service in the Scheme determined under regulation 3(6) (active membership) is for less than 2 years, that person is entitled, when that active membership ceases, to be repaid by the administering authority—
(a)
any contributions paid under or in accordance with regulation 9 or 10 in relation to that active membership;

(d)
any contributions included in a transfer payment received from a registered pension scheme or from a pension scheme or arrangement of a European pensions institution that could have been refundable under that scheme or arrangement.
(2) Where a person is entitled to repayment under paragraph (1)(c), the realisable value of any SCAVC contributions paid by the Scheme employer are repayable to the Scheme employer (other than contributions specifically paid for additional life assurance cover, in respect of additional survivor benefits or paid by the employer under a salary sacrifice scheme).

(4) Interest due under paragraph (3) is calculated at one per cent above base rate on a day to day basis from the date active membership ceased and compounded with 3-monthly rests.
(5) An administering authority shall refund contributions to a person entitled under paragraph (1) when the person requests payment, or on the expiry of a period of 5 years beginning with the date the person's active membership ceased if no request is made before then or, on the day before attaining age 75, whichever is earliest.
(6) If a person entitled to a repayment under paragraph (1) dies before the payment is made, the administering authority must pay the sum due to the person's estate.
(7) If a member dies before repayment of the deferred refund, these shall be treated as a lump sum death benefit for the purposes of Part 2 of schedule 29 of the Finance Act 2004 and taxed accordingly.
(8) The administering authority must deduct any tax due under the Finance Act 2004 or certified amount due under section 61 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 M1 from any repayment under paragraph (1) and where any such deduction is made shall secure that the money withheld is used to discharge the tax liability or is included in the contributions equivalent premium liability due under section 55 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 M2.
(9) This regulation is subject to regulation 19 (exclusion of rights to return of contributions).

21.—(1) During the period the circumstances specified in paragraph (2) apply in relation to an employment, the pensionable pay that an active member is, in relation to that employment, treated as receiving for the purposes of these Regulations (including this regulation), other than regulations 9 to 12 and 14 (excluding 11(2) (contributions)), is that member's assumed pensionable pay calculated in accordance with paragraph (4).
(2) The circumstances are that the member—
(a)
is on leave due to sickness or injury and is on reduced contractual pay or no pay;
(b)
is on child-related leave other than any part of that leave period where the pensionable pay received is greater than the assumed pensionable pay for that part of the leave period; or
(c)
is absent on reserve forces service leave.
(3) Paragraph (2)(c) does not apply in respect of any period of service which qualifies the member for benefits under any other occupational pension scheme in respect of that service.
(4) Subject to paragraphs (6) and (7), the annual rate of assumed pensionable pay for an employment for a Scheme year is—
(a)
where the member is paid monthly—
(i)
the pensionable pay the member received relating to that employment in the 3 months preceding the commencement of the pay period in which the circumstance specified in paragraph (2) began or, for the purposes of regulations 37(1)(a) (calculation of ill-health pension amounts), 38(3)(death grants: active members), 39(4)(b) (Survivor benefits: partners of active members), 40(4)(b), (5)(b), (9)(b) and (10)(b) (Survivor benefits: children of active members), the pay period in which, respectively, the ill-health retirement or death occurred;
(ii)
less any lump sum received during that period;
(iii)
with the resulting sum being grossed up to an annual figure;
(iv)
to which any regular lump sum payment received in the 12 months preceding the date specified in paragraph (i) should be added;
(v)
if the member received no pensionable pay relating to that employment in the [F13 months] preceding the commencement of the pay period in which the absence commenced, assumed pensionable pay should be calculated on the pensionable pay the member received relating to that employment in the 3 months preceding the pay period in which they last received pensionable pay in that employment;
(b)
where the member is paid otherwise than monthly—
(i)
the pensionable pay the member received relating to that employment in the 12 weeks preceding the commencement of the pay period in which the circumstance specified in paragraph (2) began or, for the purposes of regulations 37(1)(a) (calculation of ill-health pension amounts), 38(3) (death grants; active members), 40(4)(b), (5)(b), (9)(b) and (10)(b) (Survivor benefits: children of active members) the pay period in which, respectively, the ill-health retirement or death occurred;

(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4) a “regular lump sum” is a payment for which the member's employer determines there is a reasonable expectation that such a payment would be paid on a regular basis.
(6) Where the pensionable pay received by a member during the period specified in paragraph (4)(a)(i) or (4)(b)(i) was, in the opinion of the Scheme employer, materially higher or lower than that member normally received, for the purposes of this regulation the Scheme employer may substitute for the pensionable pay the member received a higher or lower level of pensionable pay to reflect the level of pensionable pay that the member would normally have received.
(7) Where any pensionable pay that has been received by a member includes fees of the kind listed in regulation 20(2)(o) (returning officer fees), for the purposes of this regulation the annual rate of pensionable pay relating to those fees for the period specified in paragraph (4)(a)(i) or (4)(b)(i) is the annual average of that pay during the 3 years preceding the date the ill-health retirement or death occurred.

[F5(3A) Each Scheme year, beginning with the Scheme year that starts on 1 April 2023, the revaluation adjustment must be applied to the balance mentioned at paragraph (3) on the revaluation date, in accordance with guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers.]
(4) Except where regulation 10 (temporary reduction in contributions) applies, the amount of earned pension for a Scheme year is 1/49th of the member's pensionable pay received in that year (irrespective of whether it relates to work carried out in that period).
(5) Where regulation 10 (temporary reduction in contributions) applies, the amount of earned pension for a Scheme year is 1/98th of the member's pensionable pay received in that year while that regulation applies (irrespective of whether it relates to work carried out during that period).
(6) Other than to correct an error in a pension account, a pension account adjustment can only arise as a consequence of—
(a)
an award of additional pension under regulation 30 (award of additional pension);
(b)
a transfer value payment being made or received;
(c)
a pension debit being made;
(d)
a Scheme pays election;
(e)
a transfer into the member's pension account from a different account upon aggregation of those accounts;
(f)
an adjustment of a description mentioned in regulation 88 (adjustment of accounts following forfeiture etc);
(g)
an adjustment of the description mentioned in paragraph (10); or
(h)
an adjustment resulting from a certificate of protection.
(7) If an active member's pension account is closed before the end of a Scheme year any pension account adjustment applicable to the account must be made immediately before the date the account is closed, but no revaluation adjustment is to be made to the active member pension account for that Scheme year.
(8) If a member starts to draw benefits under regulation [F629(7)] (flexible retirement) any pension account adjustment applicable to the active member's pension account must be made immediately before the date on which benefits start to be paid.
(9) Where—
(a)
a pension debit as is mentioned in paragraph (6)(c) is made; or
(b)
the joint liability amount specified in a notice given in relation to an election as mentioned in paragraph (6)(d) is met by the pension fund,
the appropriate administering authority shall reduce the balance in the member's account to reflect the reduction in the value of the member's rights, calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers.
(10) Where pensionable pay relating to a period before a member ceased to be an active member is paid after the period of active membership has ended, it is to be treated as if it were received on the day before the active member's account was closed.

(8) The F3... balance calculated under paragraph [F4(4), including any adjustment made in accordance with paragraph (4B),] is the opening balance for the following Scheme year and [F5having applied the revaluation adjustment to the balance in accordance with paragraph (7)] thereafter, subject to paragraph (9), the balance in the account is adjusted each year by the index rate adjustment from the date that an increase would apply if that balance were a pension in payment to which the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 M1 applied.
[F6(8A) Where an index rate adjustment is due to be made on a revaluation date, any such adjustment must be made after the revaluation adjustment is made.]
(9) If a deferred member's account is closed before the end of a Scheme year, any pension account adjustment applicable to the account must be made immediately before the date the account is closed.

(11) If a member ceases to be an active member without becoming entitled to any benefits because that member has less than 2 years qualifying service—
(a)

(3) The condition is that the member is, as a result of ill-health or infirmity of mind or body, permanently incapable of discharging efficiently the duties of the employment the member was engaged in.

35.—(1) A decision as to whether a member is entitled under regulation 34 (early payment of retirement pension on ill-health grounds: active members) to early payment of retirement pension on grounds of ill-health or infirmity of mind or body, and if so which tier of benefits the member qualifies for, shall be made by the member's Scheme employer after that authority has obtained a certificate from an IRMP as to—
(a)
whether the member satisfies the condition in regulation 34(3); and, if so
(b)
whether the member is unlikely to be capable of undertaking gainful employment before normal pension age.
(2) An IRMP from whom a certificate is obtained under paragraph (1) must not have previously advised, or given an opinion on, or otherwise been involved in the particular case for which the certificate has been requested.
(3) If the Scheme employer is not the member's appropriate administering authority, it must first obtain that authority's approval of its choice of IRMP.

(b)
whether as a result of that condition the member is unlikely to be capable of undertaking gainful employment before reaching normal pension age.Calculation of ill-health pension amounts
37.—(1) Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), Tier 1 benefits are calculated by adjusting the active member's pension account as follows—
(a)
an amount is added to the balance in the account for the year in which the member's employment was terminated, equivalent to the amount of earned pension the member would have accrued between the day following the date of termination and normal pension age, if that member had been treated as receiving assumed pensionable pay, calculated in accordance with regulation 21(4) (assumed pensionable pay) or, as appropriate regulation 21(7) for each year and fraction of a year in that period and treating any election under regulation 10 (temporary reduction in contributions) as lapsed at the date of the termination of the member's employment; and
(b)
retirement pension is payable to the member as if the member had reached normal pension age on the date the member's employment was terminated.
(2) Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), Tier 2 benefits are calculated by adjusting the active member's pension account as follows—
(a)
for the year in which the member's employment was terminated, one quarter of the sum calculated in accordance with paragraph (1)(a) is added; and
(b)
retirement pension is payable to the member as if the member had reached normal pension age on the date the member's employment was terminated.
(3) Benefits payable under regulation 36 (early payment of retirement pension on ill-health grounds: deferred members) are the retirement pension that would be payable to the member as if that member had reached normal pension age on the date the member made a request under regulation 36.
(4) Where a member entitled to Tier 1 benefits subsequently becomes an active member, no addition is to be made under paragraph (1)(a) or (2)(a) to any Tier 1 or Tier 2 benefits that the member becomes entitled to after that subsequent period of membership.
(5) Where a member entitled to Tier 2 benefits (“the initial ill-health retirement”) subsequently becomes an active member, the addition made under paragraph (1)(a) or (2)(a) to any Tier 1 or Tier 2 benefits that the member becomes entitled to after that subsequent period of membership is modified in accordance with paragraph (6).
(6) The number of years for which a member to whom paragraph (5) applies is treated as having received assumed pensionable pay for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) or (2)(a) shall not exceed—
(a)
the number of years at the date of the initial ill health retirement up to normal pension age; less
(b)
a quarter of the number of years calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph (a); less
(c)
the number of years during which the member has been an active member after the initial ill-health retirement.
(7) No adjustment is to be made to any sum by virtue of regulation [F121(8)] for any period after the date of termination of employment under regulation 34 (early payment of retirement pension on ill-health grounds: active members).
[F2(8) For the purposes of this regulation, regulations 38, 39 and 40, in calculating assumed pensionable pay in accordance with regulation 21(4) (assumed pensionable pay), no account is to be taken of any reduction in the pensionable pay the member incurred if the member was working reduced contractual hours as a consequence of ill-health or infirmity of mind or body.]

(iii)
the pension excluded any additional pension purchased under regulation 16 (additional pension contributions) and any additional pension awarded under regulation 30 (award of additional pension);

(b)
a sum equivalent to 1/240th of the member's annual assumed pensionable pay, calculated in accordance with regulation 21(4) or, as appropriate, regulation 21(9), as at the date of the member's death, for each year or fraction of a year between the date of the member's death and the member's normal pension age.
(10) The amount of pension payable under paragraph (8) where there is more than one such child, is calculated by adding together the amounts in paragraphs (a) and (b), and is payable to those children in equal shares—
(a)
the pension that the member would have been entitled to draw [F17, excluding any final guarantee amount under regulation 4B or 4C of the Transitional Provisions and Savings Regulations 2014,] if—
(i)
the member had been entitled to draw a pension on the date the member died;
(ii)
the pension the member would have been able to draw on that date had not been subject to any restriction on the age at which it could be drawn, or actuarial adjustment relating to the age at which it was drawn or following a Scheme pays election or any pension debit applied on account of a pension sharing order;
(iii)
the pension excluded any additional pension purchased under regulation 16 (additional pension contributions) and any additional pension awarded under regulation 30 (award of additional pension);

[F21(aa)
for the purposes of sub-paragraph (a), if the member died in the period beginning with 1 April and ending with 5 April in any Scheme year, the pension is deemed to include the revaluation adjustment that would have been due at the next revaluation date,]
(b)
a sum equivalent to 1/120th of the member's annual assumed pensionable pay, calculated in accordance with regulation 21(4) or, as appropriate, regulation 21(9), as at the date of the member's death, for each year or fraction of a year between the date of the member's death and the member's normal pension age.
(11) Additional pension purchased under regulation 16 is not excluded for the purposes of paragraphs (4)(a)(iii), (5)(a)(iii), (9)(a)(iii) and (10)(a)(iii) where the member has elected to purchase that additional pension to cover the amount of pension which would otherwise have accrued but for—
(a)
an absence from work with no pensionable pay in consequence of a trade dispute; or
(b)
an absence from work with permission with no pensionable pay, otherwise than because of—
(i)
illness or injury;
(ii)

(13) The balance in the survivor member's pension account at the end of the Scheme year in which the survivor member's account was opened is adjusted [F22on the revaluation date in] the following Scheme year by the revaluation adjustment applicable to the Scheme year in which the survivor member's account was opened, [F23and takes effect from the start of the Scheme year following the Scheme year in which the survivor member’s account was opened,] in accordance with guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers.
(14) The F24... balance calculated under paragraph [F25(3) or (8)] is the opening balance of the survivor member's pension account for the following Scheme year and, [F26having applied the revaluation adjustment to the balance in accordance with paragraph (13),] thereafter, the balance in the account is adjusted each year by the index rate adjustment from the date that an increase would apply if that balance were a pension in payment to which the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 applied.
[F27(15) Where an index rate adjustment is due to be made on a revaluation date, any such adjustment must be made immediately after the revaluation adjustment is made.]

41.—(1) If a deferred member dies before attaining the age of 75, the appropriate administering authority shall pay a death grant.
(2) The administering authority may, at its absolute discretion, pay the death grant to or for the benefit of the member's nominee, personal representatives or any person appearing to the authority to have been a relative or dependent of the member.

(3) The opening balance of a survivor member's pension account opened under paragraph (2) is the amount of pension payable to the eligible child or children calculated in accordance with paragraph (4) or (5) but if the pension payable under regulation 42(1) ceases to be paid, the pension payable to the eligible child or children is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (9) or (10) as from the day following the date the pension under regulation 42(1) ceased to be paid.
(4) The amount of pension payable under paragraph (3) where there is only one such child is calculated by adding together the pension that the member would have been entitled to draw [F1excluding any final guarantee amount under regulation 4B or 4C of the Transitional Provisions and Savings Regulations 2014] if—

(c)
the pension excluded any additional pension purchased under regulation 16 (additional pension contributions) and any additional pension awarded under regulation 30 (award of additional pension);

(11) Additional pension purchased under regulation 16 is not excluded for the purposes of [F22paragraphs (4)(c), (5)(c), (9)(c) and (10)(c)] where the member has elected to purchase that additional pension to cover the amount of pension which would otherwise have accrued but for—

1971 c.56.Survivor benefits: children of pensioner members
46.—(1) If a pensioner member (other than a pensioner member where the pension the member was in receipt of was derived from a pension credit) dies leaving one or more eligible children, they are entitled to a children's pension which shall come into payment on the day following the member's death.
(2) If a pension is payable to a partner of a pensioner member under regulation 45(1) (survivor benefits: partners of pensioner members), the appropriate administering authority shall open a survivor member's pension account for the eligible child or children from the day following the member's death.
(3) The opening balance of a survivor member's pension account opened under paragraph (2) is the amount of pension payable to the eligible child or children calculated in accordance with paragraph (4) or (5) but if the pension payable under regulation 45(1) ceases to be paid, the pension payable to the eligible child or children is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (9) or (10) from the day following the date the pension under regulation 45(1) ceased to be paid.
(4) The amount of pension payable under paragraph (3) where there is only one such child is calculated by adding together the pension that the member would have been entitled to draw on the date of the member's death if—
(a)
the member's earned pension (including any amount added under regulations 37(1)(a) or 37(2)(a) (enhancement of member's Tier 1 and Tier 2 benefits)) had accrued at a rate of 1/320th of pensionable pay;
(b)
the amount of any earned pension credited under regulation 96(1) (effect of acceptance of transfer value) had been multiplied by 49/320;
(c)
the member's pension had not been subject to any actuarial adjustment relating to the age at which it was drawn or following a Scheme pays election or any pension debit applied on account of a pension sharing order;
(d)
there had been no commutation under regulation 32 (election for lump sum instead of pension);
(e)
the pension excluded any additional pension purchased under regulation 16 (additional pension contributions) and any additional pension awarded under regulation 30 (award of additional pension); [F1and]

ceased to be an active member in the period beginning with 1 April and ending with 5 April in a Scheme year and subsequently died within that same period,
the pension is deemed to include the revaluation adjustment that would have been due at the next revaluation date.]
(6) At the point at which the number of eligible children is reduced to one, if a pension is still payable to a surviving partner under regulation 45(1), the pension payable to that eligible child is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (4) as from the day following the date the other eligible child's or children's pension ceased to be paid.
(7) If, on the day following the member's death, no pension is payable to a partner of a pensioner member under regulation 45(1), the appropriate administering authority shall close the pensioner member's pension account and shall open a survivor member's pension account for the eligible child or children from the day following the member's death.
(8) The opening balance of a survivor member's pension account opened under paragraph (7) is the amount of pension payable to the eligible child or children, calculated in accordance with paragraph (9) or (10).
(9) The amount of pension payable under paragraph (8) where there is only one such child is calculated by adding together the pension that the member would have been entitled to draw on the date of the member's death if—
(a)

(b)
ceased to be an active member in the period beginning with 1 April and ending with 5 April in a Scheme year and subsequently died within that same period,
the pension is deemed to include the revaluation adjustment that would have been due at the next revaluation date.]
(10) The amount of pension payable under paragraph (8) where there is more than one such child, is payable to those children in equal shares and is calculated by adding together the pension that the member would have been entitled to draw if—
(a)
the member's earned pension (including any amount added under regulations 37(1)(a) or 37(2)(a) (enhancement of member's Tier 1 and Tier 2 benefits)) had accrued at a rate of 1/120th of pensionable pay;
(b)
the amount of any earned pension credited under regulation 96(1) (effect of acceptance of transfer value) had been multiplied by 49/120;
(c)
the member's pension had not been subject to any actuarial adjustment relating to the age at which it was drawn or following a Scheme pays election or any pension debit applied on account of a pension sharing order;
(d)
there had been no commutation under regulation 32 (election for lump sum instead of pension);
(e)
the pension excluded any additional pension purchased under regulation 16 (additional pension contributions) and any additional pension awarded under regulation 30 (award of additional pension); [F13and]

[F16(10A) The pension that the member would have been entitled to, for the purpose of calculating the amount of pension payable under paragraphs (3) and (8), is not to include any final guarantee amount that has been added to the pension under regulation 4B or 4C of the Transitional Provisions and Savings Regulations 2014.]
[F17(10B) For the purposes of paragraph (10), if the member—
(a)
died in the period beginning with 1 April and ending with 5 April in the Scheme year following the Scheme year in which the member ceased to be an active member, or
(b)
ceased to be an active member in the period beginning with 1 April and ending with 5 April in a Scheme year and subsequently died within that same period,
the pension is deemed to include the revaluation adjustment that would have been due at the next revaluation date.]
(11) Additional pension purchased under regulation 16 is not excluded for the purposes of paragraphs (4)(e), (5)(e), (9)(e) and (10)(e) where the member has elected to purchase that additional pension to cover the amount of pension which would otherwise have accrued but for—
(a)
an absence from work with no pensionable pay in consequence of a trade dispute; or
(b)
an absence from work with permission with no pensionable pay, otherwise than because of—
(i)
illness or injury;
(ii)
child related leave; or
(iii)
reserve forces special leave.
(12) At the point at which the number of eligible children is reduced to one, the pension payable to that child is recalculated in accordance with paragraph (9) as from the date the other eligible child's or children's pension ceased to be paid.
(13) If the member ceased to be an active member, became a pensioner member and died all within the same Scheme year, the balance in the survivor member's pension account at the end of the Scheme year in which the survivor member's account was opened is adjusted [F18on the revaluation date in] the following Scheme year by the revaluation adjustment applicable to the Scheme year in which the survivor member's account was opened, [F19and takes effect from the start of the Scheme year following the Scheme year in which the member became a pensioner member,] in accordance with guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers.
(14) Where—
(a)
paragraph (13) applies, the F20... balance calculated under paragraph [F21(3) or (8)] is the opening balance of the survivor member's pension account for the following Scheme year [F22and the revaluation adjustment is applied to the balance in accordance with paragraph (13)];
(b)
paragraph (13) does not apply, the balance under paragraph (3) or (8), as the case may be, is the opening balance of the survivor member's pension account for the following Scheme year,
and, thereafter, the balance in the account is adjusted each year by the index rate adjustment from the date that an increase would apply if that balance were a pension in payment to which the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 M1 applied.
[F23(14A) Where an index rate adjustment is due to be made on a revaluation date, any such adjustment must be made immediately after the revaluation adjustment is made.]
(15) For the purposes of paragraphs (4)(a), (5)(a), (9)(a) and (10)(a), earned pension also includes any amount awarded under regulations 37(1)(a) or (2)(a).

(c)
the take-over, amalgamation, insolvency, winding up or liquidation of the deferred employer;

(a)
in the case where a body is an admission body falling within paragraph 1(d) of Part 2 of schedule 2 of these Regulations (Scheme employers: bodies providing services as a result of transfer of a service), the revised contribution due from the body which is the related employer in relation to that admission body; and
(b)
in any other case, the revised contributions due from each Scheme employer which contributes to the fund,
with a view to providing that assets equivalent to the exit payment due from the exiting employer are provided to the fund over such period of time as the administering authority considers reasonable.
(6) Where in the opinion of an administering authority there are circumstances which make it likely that a Scheme employer (including an admission body) will become an exiting employer, the administering authority may obtain from an actuary a certificate specifying the percentage or amount by which, in the actuary's opinion—
(a)
the contribution at the primary rate should be adjusted; or
(b)
any prior secondary rate adjustment should be increased or reduced,
with a view to providing that assets equivalent to the exit payment that will be due from the Scheme employer are provided to the fund by the likely exit date or, where the Scheme employer is unable to meet that liability by that date, over such period of time thereafter as the administering authority considers reasonable.
(7) When an exiting employer has paid the exit payment into the appropriate fund (or received the exit credit), no further payments are due from that employer in respect of any liabilities relating to the benefits in respect of any current or former employees of that employer as a result of these Regulations.
(8) [F6Paragraph (9)] applies where—
(a)
a Scheme employer agrees to pay increased contributions to meet the cost of an award of additional pension under regulation 30 (award of additional pension); or

(2) A certificate of protection issued by a Scheme employer after the coming into force of these Regulations has effect for 10 years from the date the member's pay is reduced or restricted and, where the member elects, the member's pay for the purposes of calculating the member's pension (and other benefits under these Regulations) is the member's pay but as if the reduction or other restriction specified in the certificate had not come into effect.
(3) A member is not entitled to be issued with a certificate under this regulation if the reduction in the member's rate of pay—

(a)
to which the TUPE Regulations apply; or
(b)
which is treated as if it were a relevant transfer within the meaning of regulation 2(1) and 3 of the TUPE Regulations, notwithstanding regulation 3(5) of those Regulations.
(9) If the member leaves the employment under which the certificate was issued, without becoming entitled to immediate or deferred pension benefits, the certificate lapses.
(10) The operation of a certificate issued under this regulation is subject to guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers.Rights to payment out of pension fund
91.—(1) A member is entitled to request a transfer under Chapter 1 or 2 of Part 4ZA of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 M1 and where the member does so the amount of any transfer payment due in respect of the member under the relevant transfer may only be paid by the administering authority from its pension fund if the transfer payment is a recognised transfer (within the meaning of section 169 of the Finance Act 2004 M2) in accordance with guidance from Scottish Ministers.
[F1(1A) Where a transfer under paragraph (1) is applied for by an eligible member and is not a Club Transfer, the value of the transfer is to be calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers, taking into account the member’s provisional underpin amount and provisional assumed benefits, which are calculated in accordance with regulations 4I and 4J of the Transitional Provisions and Savings Regulations 2014.]
(2) Where such a transfer payment is to be or has been paid from a fund, no other payment or transfer of assets may be made from the fund as respects the accrued rights covered by the transfer payment.
(3) Paragraph (2) overrides anything to the contrary in these Regulations.

7.  Notwithstanding paragraph 6, and subject to paragraph 8, the admission agreement must further provide that where the level of risk identified by the assessment is such as to require it, the admission body shall enter into an indemnity or bond in a form approved by the administering authority with—

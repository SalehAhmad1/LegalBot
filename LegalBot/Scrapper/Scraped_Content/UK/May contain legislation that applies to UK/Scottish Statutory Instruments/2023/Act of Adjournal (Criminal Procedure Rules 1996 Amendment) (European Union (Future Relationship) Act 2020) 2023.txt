31st May 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Adjournal)
This Act of Adjournal makes necessary consequential amendments to the Criminal Procedure Rules 1996 (“the 1996 Rules”) following upon the United Kingdom leaving the European Union on 31st December 2020, and in consequence of the European Union (Future Relationship) Act 2020.
Paragraph 2(2)(a) amends the heading of Chapter 34A, omitting reference to European Arrest Warrant. After the transition period (which ended on 31st December 2020), Directive 2010/64/EU has no legal effect in Scotland and European Arrest Warrants are obsolete.
Paragraphs 2(2)(b) and (c) amend rules 34A.1 and 34A.2 to remove references to Directive 2010/64/EU. Chapter 34A now applies to all Part 1 warrants, of which European Arrest Warrants are a subset.
Paragraph 2(3) removes all reference to European Protection Orders (“EPO”) and European Investigation Orders (“EIO”) respectively from the 1996 Rules by revoking Chapters 61 and 67 and associated forms. After 31st December 2020, both EPOs and EIOs are obsolete.
Paragraph 3 makes saving provision in respect of any EPO or EIO received before the end of the transition period and in respect of any EPOs issued before 1st December 2022 which is the date that the Civil Protection Measures, European Protection Order and Victims’ Rights (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment Etc.) Regulations 2022 (S.S.I. 2022/249) came into force.

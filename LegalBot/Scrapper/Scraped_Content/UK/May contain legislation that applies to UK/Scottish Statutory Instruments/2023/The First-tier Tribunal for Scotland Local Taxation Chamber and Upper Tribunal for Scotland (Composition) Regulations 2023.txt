(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision as to the composition of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland when dealing with cases in the Local Taxation Chamber. They also make provision as to the composition of the Upper Tribunal for Scotland when dealing with cases appealed or referred from the Local Taxation Chamber.
The First-tier Tribunal for Scotland and the Upper Tribunal for Scotland are known collectively as the Scottish Tribunals. The Scottish Tribunals were established by the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014. The First-tier Tribunal is divided into chambers according to the subject matter of the case, with the Local Taxation Chamber dealing with a range of matters relating to local taxation including property valuation, council tax banding and council tax reduction appeals. Members of the tribunals can be ordinary members, legal members or judicial members according to criteria set out in the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014 and regulations made under that Act. This instrument sets out which member or members may hear local taxation cases in the two tribunals.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared for these Regulations and placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Copies can be obtained from the Scottish Government Justice Directorate, St Andrew’s House, Edinburgh EH1 3DG, and online at www.legislation.gov.uk.

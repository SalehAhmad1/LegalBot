(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 7(1) of the Agriculture (Retained EU Law and Data) (Scotland) Act 2020 in order to clarify the minimum duration of an operational programme in the fruit and vegetables sector under Article 33 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (“the CMO”).
Article 33 of the CMO is amended by Regulation (EU) 2020/2220 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 December 2020 laying down certain transitional provisions for support from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), which created a derogation, the operation of which is ambiguous, from the duration of operational programmes.
Regulation 2 amends Article 33 to remove any uncertainty with the effect that the duration of an operational programme in the fruit and vegetables sector is from two to three years.
The amendment only applies to operational programmes of producer organisations, or associations of producer organisations which have their head office located in Scotland. Articles 14A and 21A of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/891 make provision regarding the location of the head office of a producer organisation and an association of producer organisations respectively.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

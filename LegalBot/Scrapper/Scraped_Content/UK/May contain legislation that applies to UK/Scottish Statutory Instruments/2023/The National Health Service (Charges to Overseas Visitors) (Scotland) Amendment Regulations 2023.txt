(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Scotland) Regulations 1989 (“the principal Regulations”) which provide for the making and recovery of charges for health services provided to certain persons who are not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.
These Regulations amend regulation 5(c) of the principal Regulations so that it provides that no charge for services forming part of the health service, provided only for the purpose of giving treatment the need for which arose during the visit, shall be made in respect of any overseas visitor who is “a person resident in a country or territory specified in schedule 2, other than Bermuda, Cayman Islands or Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands”.
These Regulations also amend schedule 2 of the principal Regulations by adding “Bermuda”, “Cayman Islands”, and “Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands” to the list of countries and territories with which the United Kingdom has a reciprocal agreement. “St Helena” is substituted with “St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha”.

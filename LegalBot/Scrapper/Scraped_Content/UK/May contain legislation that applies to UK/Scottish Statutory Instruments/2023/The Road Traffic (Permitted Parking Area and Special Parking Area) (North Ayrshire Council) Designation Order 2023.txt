(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order applies, to the North Ayrshire local government area, arrangements for enforcing parking controls already available in London and certain other areas in England and in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth and Kinross, Aberdeen, Dundee, South Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire, Fife, East Dunbartonshire, Argyll and Bute, Inverclyde, Highland, East Lothian, Angus, Stirling, North Lanarkshire, Midlothian and Falkirk local government areas.
The Order designates North Ayrshire local government area (with specified exceptions) as a permitted parking area and as a special parking area in accordance with schedule 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”).
The Order applies, to the designated area, various provisions of the 1991 Act and modifies them where necessary. It also makes consequential modifications to certain provisions of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act”) dealing with parking and related matters.
While the Order is in force, certain specified offences will be decriminalised: for example, in the case of the permitted parking area, breaches of orders relating to on‑street parking places and, in the case of the special parking area, orders prohibiting or restricting waiting, loading and unloading.
Enforcement will be carried out by parking attendants provided under section 63A of the 1984 Act. The First-tier Tribunal will hear disputes against decisions by the parking authority.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (“the Fees Regulations”) and the Student Support (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (“the Student Support Regulations”).
These Regulations amend the long residence provision in regulation 3 of the Fees Regulations and paragraph 1 of schedule 1 of the Student Support Regulations to extend home fee status and student support to persons who, on the relevant date, are ordinarily resident in Scotland, have been ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for 3 years and have not applied for refugee status but have been granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom which has not expired. Eligibility also extends to the spouse, civil partner or child of such a person.
Amendments are also made to both the Fees Regulations and the Student Support Regulations to require that Ukrainian nationals are ordinarily resident in Scotland on the relevant date in order to be eligible for home fee status and student support and to provide home fee status and student support to the children of asylum seekers and unaccompanied young asylum seekers.
Amendments are made to the Student Support Regulations to extend student loan support to postgraduate courses undertaken at an institution outside Scotland and for education maintenance allowances to be paid to college students under those regulations.

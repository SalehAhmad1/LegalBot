6th June 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 (the “2004 Regulations”) and come into force on 1 April 2024.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 2 of the 2004 Regulations to insert new definitions of “direct emission heating system” and “pre-2024 building”. Regulation 4 amends schedule 5 of the 2004 Regulations to introduce new standard 6.11 which creates restrictions on the installation of direct emissions heating systems. Regulation 5 applies new standard 6.11 to conversions with particular provision made for conversion of buildings constructed before 1 April 2024 or after that date if constructed in accordance with a building warrant granted in respect of an application made before that date. Regulation 6 makes transitional provision the effect of which is that the amended 2004 Regulations will not apply to work which does not require a building warrant and which is completed before 1 April 2024 or work which is not completed before that date where the contract for the work is entered into before that date and the work is completed before 1 July 2024.

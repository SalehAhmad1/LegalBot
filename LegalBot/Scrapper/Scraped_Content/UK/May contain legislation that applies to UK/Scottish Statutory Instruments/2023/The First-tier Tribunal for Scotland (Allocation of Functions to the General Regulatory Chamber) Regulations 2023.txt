23rd May 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014 (“the 2014 Act”) created a new structure for tribunals in Scotland dealing with devolved matters under the judicial leadership of the Lord President of the Court of Session as head of the Scottish Tribunals. It provides for a First-tier Tribunal and an Upper Tribunal for Scotland, with these being known, collectively, as the Scottish Tribunals. Generally, the First-tier Tribunal deals with cases in the first instance to which a general right of appeal lies to the Upper Tribunal. The 2014 Act provides for the First-tier Tribunal to be divided into chambers in order to deal with the various matters falling within the jurisdiction of the Scottish Tribunals.
These Regulations allocate functions to the First-tier Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber: those relating to low emission zone schemes, pavement parking prohibitions, double parking prohibitions, dropped footway parking prohibitions and workplace parking licensing schemes. These functions are conferred on the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland by regulations made under the Transport (Scotland) Act 2019 (“the 2019 Act”).
These Regulations come into force on 1 June 2023. Regulation 3 will take effect on such later date as regulations are made under section 59 of the 2019 Act.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

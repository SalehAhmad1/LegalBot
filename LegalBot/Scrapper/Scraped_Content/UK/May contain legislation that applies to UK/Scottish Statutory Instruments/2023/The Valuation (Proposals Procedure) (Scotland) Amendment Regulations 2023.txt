(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Valuation (Proposals Procedure) (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (“the 2022 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 inserts a new regulation 17A into the 2022 Regulations. This provides that, for the revaluation year 2023-24 only, the deadline for lodging a proposal in relation to a valuation notice issued under section 3(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975 is extended. The extension is from 31 July 2023 to 31 August 2023 or, if later, to a date four months after the sending of the valuation notice to the proprietor, tenant or occupier of the property in question. Consequently, for the revaluation year 2023-24 the deadline set out in column 2 of the fifth entry in the table in schedule 1 of the Valuation Timetable (Scotland) Order 2022 does not apply.

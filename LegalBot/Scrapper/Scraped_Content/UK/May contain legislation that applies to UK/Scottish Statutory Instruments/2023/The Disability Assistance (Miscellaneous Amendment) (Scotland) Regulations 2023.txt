Paragraph (6) corrects a typographical error. Paragraph (7) amends paragraph 8 of Part 3 of the schedule to provide for when the Scottish Ministers have the power to stop the transfer to Child Disability Payment in respect of an individual who was ordinarily resident in Scotland at the time the notice of intention to transfer was issued, and subsequently moves elsewhere in the UK before the transfer determination takes place.

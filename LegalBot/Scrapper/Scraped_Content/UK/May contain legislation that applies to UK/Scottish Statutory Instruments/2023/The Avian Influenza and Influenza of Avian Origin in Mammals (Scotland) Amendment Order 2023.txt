(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Avian Influenza and Influenza of Avian Origin in Mammals (Scotland) Order 2006 (“the 2006 Order”), which makes provision for the control of avian influenza.
Article 2(2)(b) amends the definition of “authorised veterinary inspector” to include a veterinary inspector authorised by the Scottish Ministers to receive information about mammals and mammal carcases, where the presence of influenza of avian origin is suspected or the presence of antibodies to influenza virus of avian origin is detected. Article 2(4) adds a requirement to notify an authorised veterinary inspector in such circumstances. Article 2(2)(e) amends the definition of “carcase” consequent to the insertion of a definition of “mammal carcase” by article 2(2)(g).
Article 2(2)(c) amends the definition of “border inspection post” to mean a border control post, together with the facilities there, designated by the Scottish Ministers in accordance with the Official Controls Regulation. Subsequent references to “border inspection post” throughout the 2006 Order are amended accordingly by article 2(9) to (13).
Article 2(2)(f) inserts a definition of “game birds”.
Article 2(2)(h) amends the definition of “non-commercial premises” to mean premises where poultry or other captive birds are kept as pets. Article 2(2)(k) extends the list of premises considered “special category premises”, where the Scottish Ministers may, following a risk assessment, apply less stringent measures where avian influenza is confirmed. Article 2(8) amends article 31 of the 2006 Order to allow less stringent measures to be applied, following a risk assessment, where avian influenza is confirmed in poultry or other captive birds on special category premises. The amendment to article 31 provides for the situation in controlled zones previously provided for by articles 28(2)(b) and 29(2)(b) of the 2006 Order, which are omitted by article 2(6) and 2(7) respectively.
Article 2(3) inserts provision to allow declarations made by the Scottish Ministers under the 2006 Order to be made by a member of staff of the Scottish Ministers.
Article 2(5) extends the list of measures applicable where avian influenza is suspected on premises which Scottish Ministers may choose to disapply following a risk assessment, to include restrictions on the movement of eggs.
Article 2(14) inserts provision in respect of the ending of controlled zones imposed where low pathogenic avian influenza is confirmed on premises.
Article 2(16) extends the requirement for poultry to remain at premises outside a controlled zone for 21 days following movement from a protection zone to include brood-and-move poultry and excludes day-old chicks moved from a low pathogenic avian influenza restricted zone from this requirement. Definitions of “brood-and-move poultry” and “ready to lay poultry” are inserted by article 2(2)(d) and 2(2)(i) respectively.
Article 2(17) amends the requirements for any person moving poultry, other captive birds or their products under any licence granted under the 2006 Order to keep records of the movement, including the quantity of what was moved, the registration of any vehicle used and addresses of the premises of origin and destination.
Article 2(18) amends Schedule 4 of the 2006 Order to extend the movement restrictions applicable in protection zones to include brood-and-move poultry, extends movements permitted under licence to include the movement of brood-and-move poultry, the movement of poultry and other captive birds to, and return from, a location where veterinary assistance of animals takes place for treatment, and adds the requirement for Ministerial approval for the movement of poultry to a designated slaughterhouse for immediate slaughter where the slaughterhouse is situated in a different constituent territory of Great Britain. Article 2(2)(a) inserts a definition of “the appropriate Minister”.
Article 2(19) amends Schedule 5 of the 2006 Order to extend the movement restrictions applicable in surveillance zones to include carcases and brood-and-move poultry and extends movements permitted under licence to include the movement of brood-and-move poultry, the movement of poultry and other captive birds to, and return from, a location where veterinary assistance of animals takes place for treatment, and adds the requirement for Ministerial approval for the movement of poultry to a designated slaughterhouse for immediate slaughter where the slaughterhouse is situated in a different constituent territory of Great Britain.

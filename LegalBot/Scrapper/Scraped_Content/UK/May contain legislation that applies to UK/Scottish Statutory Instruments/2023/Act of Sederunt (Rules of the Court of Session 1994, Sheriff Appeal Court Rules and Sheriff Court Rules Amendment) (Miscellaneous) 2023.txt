SCHEDULE 5EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)
This Act of Sederunt makes amendments to the Rules of the Court of Session 1994, the Act of Sederunt (Sheriff Appeal Court Rules) 2021 (“the 2021 Rules”), the Act of Sederunt (Sheriff Appeal Court Rules) 2015 (“the 2015 Rules”), the Ordinary Cause Rules 1993 and the Act of Sederunt (Summary Applications, Statutory Applications and Appeals etc. Rules) 1999 (“the 1999 Rules”). These amendments provide that a party to the proceedings may make an application for an order restricting the reporting of the proceedings in the relevant court. The application must be made by motion and accompanied by the relevant form, in order that the court be given detailed reasons as to why such an order is sought.
The 2015 Rules were revoked by the 2021 Rules but, with exception to rules 21.2 to 21.4, were saved in relation to any proceedings raised before 6th January 2022. Accordingly, the Sheriff Appeal Court Rules 2015 will continue to apply to proceedings which are still ongoing on 2nd October 2023.
Paragraph 6(2)(b) also amends rule 3.54.4(6) of the 1999 Rules to correct a cross-referencing error.

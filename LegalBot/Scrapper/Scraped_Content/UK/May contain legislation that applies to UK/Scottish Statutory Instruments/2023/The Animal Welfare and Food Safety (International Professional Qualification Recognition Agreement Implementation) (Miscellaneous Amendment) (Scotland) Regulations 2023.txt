In accordance with section 14 of the Professional Qualifications Act 2022 the Scottish Ministers are satisfied that these Regulations do not remove the ability of any regulator of a regulated profession to prevent individuals who are unfit to practise the profession from doing so, and that the regulations will not have a material adverse effect on any regulated profession in terms of the knowledge, skills or experience of the individuals practising it.
In accordance with section 15 of that Act the Scottish Ministers have consulted with the regulator affected by these Regulations.
In accordance with section 48(4A) of the Food Safety Act 1990 the Scottish Ministers have had regard to relevant advice given by Food Standards Scotland(3).
There has been consultation as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety, as it has effect in EU law(4).

The functions of the Secretary of State, so far as within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998. In so far as not transferred, those functions were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by the Scotland Act 1998 (Transfer of Functions to the Scottish Ministers etc.) Order 2005 (S.I. 2005/849).

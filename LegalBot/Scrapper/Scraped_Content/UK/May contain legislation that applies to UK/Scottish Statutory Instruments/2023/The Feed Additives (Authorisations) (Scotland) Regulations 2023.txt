the minimum level of stock enzyme activity is reduced from 10,000 BXU/g to 5,000 BXU/g in the liquid form.
Schedule 11 contains a new authorisation, for L-lysine (liquid) produced from Corynebacterium glutamicum (KCCM 80216 or KCTC 12307BP) (identification number 3c326).
Schedule 12 contains a new authorisation, for L-lysine monohydrochloride produced from Corynebacterium glutamicum (KCCM 80216 or KCTC 12307BP) (identification number 3c327).
Schedule 13 contains a new authorisation, for a preparation of 3-nitrooxypropanol (identification number 4c1).
Regulation 3(2) provides that the authorisations are valid for a period of 10 years, in accordance with Article 9(7) of Regulation (EC) 1831/2003. This is subject to Article 14(4) of that Regulation, which provides for an extension of the authorisation period in certain circumstances following the submission of an application for renewal.
Regulation 4 makes transitional provision in relation to the feed additive endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) the authorisation of which is renewed under schedule 9. Under the renewal of the authorisation the identification number of the feed additive is changed. Regulation 4 allows the continued production and labelling of products, for the specified limited time periods, under the conditions of the prior authorisation and the labelling requirements applicable immediately before the coming into force of these Regulations. Products produced within the transitional periods may be marketed and used until stocks are exhausted.
Regulation 5 amends Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No601/2013 by removing from the Annex the authorisations for cobalt (II) acetate tetrahydrate, cobalt (II) carbonate, cobalt (II) carbonate hydroxide (2:3) monohydrate and cobalt (II) sulphate heptahydrate. This is consequential to the Feed Additives (Form of Provisional Authorisations) (Cobalt (II) Compounds) (Scotland) Regulations 2023 (S.S.I. 2023/170) which provisionally authorised these feed additives.
Regulation 6 amends Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/221 by revoking articles which amend Commission Regulation (EU) No 9/2010 and Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) No 528/2011 and 1021/2012. Those Regulations are revoked by regulation 7 and schedule 14.
Regulation 7 and schedule 14 revoke retained direct EU legislation that contains previous authorisations for the feed additives now authorised by schedules 1, 9 and 10.

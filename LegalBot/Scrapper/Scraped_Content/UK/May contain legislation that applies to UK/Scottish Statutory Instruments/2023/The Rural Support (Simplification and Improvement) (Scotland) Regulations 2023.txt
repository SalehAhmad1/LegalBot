(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations modify a number of instruments to simplify and improve their operation.
Regulation 2 omits points (a) and (b) of Article 31(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (“the Direct Payments Regulation”). This removes provision regarding replenishment of national or regional reserves from payment entitlements not giving right to payments during two consecutive years due to the application specified provisions, and from payment entitlements not activated for two consecutive years.
Regulation 3 is consequential upon the change made by regulation 2 and omits Article 24(2) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 639/2014. Article 24(2) sets out how overdeclarations of payment entitlements are to be considered for the purposes of Article 31(1)(b) of the Direct Payments Regulation.
Regulation 4 is consequential upon the change made by regulation 2, and omits Article 9 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 641/2014. Article 9 sets out when payment entitlements revert to the national or regional reserve as a consequence of the operation of Article 31(1)(a) and (b) of the Direct Payments Regulation.
Regulation 5 omits regulation 9(4) of the Common Agricultural Policy (Direct Payments etc.) (Scotland) Regulations 2015 to remove the requirements relating to reversion to the national reserve of annual unit value of payment entitlements that are transferred without land.

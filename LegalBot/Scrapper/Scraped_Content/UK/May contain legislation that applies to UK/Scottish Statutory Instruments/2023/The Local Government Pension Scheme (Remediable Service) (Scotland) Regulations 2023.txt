Statutory underpin: retirement, redundancy, ill health
4B.—(1) This regulation applies in relation to an eligible member whose final underpin date is that in regulation 4H(1)(a), (c), (d) or (e) (statutory underpin: final underpin date).

the underpin period for the purpose of those calculations begins with the day on which the eligible member’s reduced hours or grade began; and
(b)
those calculations are not to include any period which has already been used in the calculation of a final guarantee amount in relation to the pension account.
(10) At the eligible member’s next occurring final underpin date (which may be on the same day as the additional underpin date, or after), the eligible member’s final assumed benefits and final underpin amount in relation to the eligible member’s pension account are calculated in accordance with regulations 4K and 4L but using the provisional assumed benefits and provisional underpin amounts as provided for in paragraph (9).

(a)
the eligible member had paid contributions under regulation 9 of the 2018 Regulations in respect of the underpin period—
(i)
including—

in respect of any period of absence from work because of illness or injury, child-related leave or reserve forces service leave;
(bb)
where, on the underpin date, the eligible member left active membership with an entitlement to Tier 1 or Tier 2 benefits under regulation 34(4) or (5) respectively of the 2018 Regulations, any adjustment under regulation 37 of those Regulations (calculation of ill-health pension amounts) in respect of the underpin period;

any period of unpaid absence from work without permission;
(b)
the eligible member or their Scheme employer had, in respect of the underpin period, paid no additional contributions under—

(i)
a Chapter 1 scheme(10);
(ii)
a judicial scheme(11);
(iii)
another local government scheme(12),
where service in that scheme was remediable service and there was no continuous break of more than five years in active membership of a public service pension scheme since the remediable service was accrued;
(e)
the revaluation adjustment (as defined in Schedule 1 of the 2018 Regulations) that would have applied to the eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits had they been benefits built up in an active member’s pension account, had been made up to and including the eligible member’s underpin date;
(f)

(b)
31 March 2022; and
(c)
the eligible member’s underpin date.

(6) Where paragraph (1)(a)(i)(cc) or (dd) apply in relation to a period during which the eligible member was paying reduced contributions under regulation 10 of the 2018 Regulations, the additional pension included in the provisional assumed benefits for that period is that which would have been payable had the eligible member not been paying reduced contributions.
(7) Where the eligible member has qualifying service for less than a period of two years, the member is treated as having qualifying service for a period of two years for the purpose of calculating their provisional assumed benefits.

Statutory underpin: calculation of the provisional underpin amount
4J.—(1) The eligible member’s provisional underpin amount is calculated by assessing the benefits the eligible member would have been entitled to under the 2009 Scheme over the underpin period at the eligible member’s underpin date if—
(a)
the member had accrued membership under the 2009 Scheme, rather than the 2015 Scheme;
(b)
the period of membership taken into account for the purposes of sub-paragraph (a) was—
(i)
the period during which the member has paid, or is treated as having paid, contributions under regulations 9 or 10 of the 2018 Regulations (contributions and reduced contributions);
(ii)
any period of unpaid absence due to a trade dispute, or absence from work with permission, otherwise than because of illness or injury, child related leave, or reserve forces service leave, if the eligible member elected to cover that period by entering into an arrangement under regulation 16 of the 2018 Regulations (additional pension contributions); and
(iii)
where the member became entitled to Tier 1 or Tier 2 benefits under regulation 34 of the 2018 Regulations, any additional period of membership that would have been added to the member’s total membership under regulation 20(2) (in respect of a Tier 1 pension) or regulation 20(3) (in respect of a Tier 2 pension) of the Benefits Regulations (early leavers: ill-health), up to the end of the underpin period, as if the member had been entitled to an increase in benefits under the provision in question at the underpin date;
(c)
the eligible member’s final pay used to calculate the provisional underpin amount is calculated in accordance with regulations 9 to 11 of the Benefits Regulations (final pay) or, in the case of a councillor member, career average pay is calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 of the schedule to the Benefits Regulations and those provisions apply in relation to the eligible member as if those provisions were still in force at the underpin date;
(d)
the eligible member had been credited with 2009 Scheme benefits in respect of remediable service transferred from—
(i)
a Chapter 1 scheme;
(ii)
a judicial scheme; or
(iii)
another local government scheme; and
there was no continuous break of more than five years in active membership of a public service pension scheme since the remediable service was accrued; and
(e)
where the balance in the eligible member’s pension account at the underpin date had been adjusted on account of any pension debit or Scheme pays election, that adjustment had not occurred.
(2) Where paragraph (1)(b)(ii) applies, the unpaid period to be used in relation to the provisional underpin amount is the proportion of the period of absence that is equal to the proportion of the full amount of contributions to be paid under the arrangement that have been paid by the eligible member.
(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply if the eligible member fails to pay all the additional pension contributions due because—
(a)
the eligible member left active membership of the 2015 Scheme under regulation 34 of the 2018 Regulations with an entitlement to Tier 1 or Tier 2 benefits under regulation 34(4) or (5) of those Regulations respectively; or

the eligible member died as an active member.
(4) Where paragraph (2) does not apply, any part of the period of absence falling within the underpin period that is covered by the arrangement under regulation 16(1) or (3) of the 2018 Regulations (additional pension contributions) entered into by the eligible member is to be included in the calculation of the provisional underpin amount.
(5) Where the eligible member has qualifying service for less than a period of two years, the member is treated as having qualifying service for a period of two years for the purpose of calculating their provisional underpin amount.
(6) Paragraph (7) applies where, after the eligible member’s underpin date, the eligible member completes—
(a)
a transfer in of remediable service from—
(i)
a Chapter 1 scheme;
(ii)
a judicial scheme; or
(iii)
another local government scheme; or
(b)
the aggregation of remediable service from the 2015 Scheme.
(7) Where this paragraph applies—
(a)
the eligible member’s provisional underpin amount is to be calculated as at the eligible member’s underpin date taking into account their transferred in or aggregated remediable service; and
(b)
any calculation of a provisional underpin amount done in respect of the pension account into which the remediable service has been transferred or aggregated is set aside.
(8) Paragraph (7) does not apply if there has been a continuous break in active membership of a public service pension scheme of more than five years since the remediable service was accrued.
Statutory underpin: calculation of final assumed benefits
4K.—(1) An eligible member’s final assumed benefits are calculated by adjusting their provisional assumed benefits at the eligible member’s final underpin date in accordance with this regulation.
(2) Where the eligible member’s underpin date is not the same date as their final underpin date, apply any revaluation adjustment or index rate adjustment to provisional assumed benefits that would have applied to a deferred benefit in the 2015 Scheme as if the last day of scheme membership was the underpin date.
(3) Where regulation 29(5) of the 2018 Regulations (pension taken later than normal pension age) applies to the eligible member, apply the enhancement as set out in that provision to provisional assumed benefits.
(4) Where regulation 29(6) (pension taken earlier than normal pension age) or (7) (pension by virtue of flexible retirement) of the 2018 Regulations applies to the eligible member and their benefits under the 2015 Scheme are being reduced as set out in that provision, apply an equivalent reduction to provisional assumed benefits.
(5) Where paragraph (4) applies, also reflect in the reduction such transitional provisions under Schedule 2 as apply (if any).
(6) Where—
(a)
the eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits include an additional pension under regulation 16 of the 2018 Regulations;
(b)
the member is taking payment of their pension before the normal pension age applicable to them under the 2015 Scheme; and
(c)
regulation 29(8)(a) of the 2018 Regulations (pension by virtue of dismissal from employment) applies to reduce the amount of pension payable,
the additional pension referred to in paragraph (a) is to be reduced in accordance with regulation 29(8)(a) of the 2018 Regulations.
Statutory underpin: calculation of final underpin amount
4L.—(1) An eligible member’s final underpin amount is calculated by adjusting their provisional underpin amount at the eligible member’s final underpin date in accordance with this regulation.
(2) Add any amount by which their provisional underpin amount would be increased if it were a pension to which the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971(14) applied, which relates to the period—
(a)
beginning with the day after the day on which the period used for the purposes of calculating the eligible member’s final pay or, as the case may be, career average pay under the Benefits Regulations ends; and
(b)
ending with the eligible member’s final underpin date.
(3) Where an eligible member first receives payment of their retirement pension after the day on which they attain the age of 65, apply an enhancement calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers.
(4) Where—
(a)
regulation 29(6) (pension taken earlier than normal pension age) or (7) (pension by virtue of flexible retirement) of the 2018 Regulations applies to an eligible member;
(b)
the eligible member has not attained the age of 65; and
(c)
the eligible member’s benefits under any of the Earlier Schemes are being reduced under regulation 3(5),
apply an adjustment calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers.
(5) Where paragraph (4) applies, the reduction is also to reflect such transitional provisions under Schedule 2 as apply (if any).
Statutory underpin: survivor’s guarantee amount calculation
4M.—(1) This regulation applies where—
(a)
an eligible member dies; and
(b)
as a result, a survivor member’s pension becomes payable under regulation 39, 40, 42, 43, 45 or 46 of the 2018 Regulations.
(2) A proportion of a survivor guarantee amount is to be added to a survivor member’s pension account in accordance with this regulation on the day after the eligible member’s death.
(3) A “survivor guarantee amount” is the amount by which an eligible member’s adjusted assumed benefits are exceeded by their adjusted underpin amount.
(4) The eligible member’s adjusted assumed benefits are calculated by adjusting their provisional assumed benefits as follows—
(a)
where the eligible member’s date of death is the same as their underpin date, increase the eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits by an amount equivalent to 1/49th of their annual assumed pensionable pay, calculated in accordance with regulation 21(4) or, as appropriate, 21(9) of the 2018 Regulations as at the date of the eligible member’s death;
(b)
where the eligible member was working reduced contractual hours as a consequence of ill-health or infirmity of mind or body, the increase referred to in sub-paragraph (a) is to take no account of any reduction in the pensionable pay the eligible member incurred; and
(c)
where the eligible member’s date of death is not the same date as their underpin date, apply any revaluation adjustment or index rate adjustment that would have applied to a deferred benefit in the 2015 Scheme as if the last day of scheme membership was the underpin date.
(5) The increase referred to in paragraph (4)(a) applies in relation to the period—
(a)
beginning with the day after the eligible member’s death; and
(b)
ending with the earlier of—
(i)
31 March 2022; and
(ii)
the date on which the eligible member would have attained—
(aa)
the normal retirement age applicable to them under the 2009 Scheme; or
(bb)
where the eligible member was not a member of the 2009 Scheme, the age of 65.
(6) The eligible member’s adjusted underpin amount is calculated by adjusting their provisional underpin amount as follows—
(a)
where the eligible member’s date of death is the same as their underpin date, increase the eligible member’s provisional underpin amount according to any additional period of membership that would have been added to the eligible member’s total membership under regulation 20(2) of the Benefits Regulations up to and including 31 March 2022 if the eligible member’s employment had been terminated on grounds of ill-health or infirmity of mind or body; and
(b)
add any increase that would apply were the adjusted underpin amount a pension to which the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 applied, which relates to the period—
(i)
beginning with the day after the day on which the period used for the purposes of calculating the eligible member’s final pay or, as the case may be, career average pay under the Benefits Regulations ends; and
(ii)
ending with the date of the eligible member’s death.
(7) A survivor pension paid under a provision listed in column 2 of the following table is to be increased by the proportion of the survivor guarantee amount specified in the corresponding entry in column 3 of the table—
1. Type of survivor pension 2. Provision of the 2018 Regulations under which the pension is paid 3. Proportion of survivor guarantee amount to be added
Partner pension: spouse, civil partner or cohabiting partner 39(4), 42(4), 45(4)

Statutory underpin: death grants
4N.—(1) This regulation applies where—
(a)
an eligible member who is a deferred member of the 2015 Scheme dies; and
(b)
as a result, a death grant becomes payable under regulation 41 of the 2018 Regulations.
(2) A deferred guarantee amount relating to the eligible member is to be included in the amount the eligible member would have been entitled to receive as retirement pension annually for the purposes of the calculation of a death grant under regulation 41(3) of the 2018 Regulations.
(3) A “deferred guarantee amount” is the amount by which the eligible member’s deferred assumed benefits are exceeded by their deferred underpin amount.
(4) An eligible member’s deferred assumed benefits are calculated by adjusting their provisional assumed benefits to apply any revaluation adjustment or index rate adjustment that would have applied to a deferred benefit in the 2015 Scheme as if the last day of scheme membership was the underpin date.

(8) Paragraphs (9) and (10) apply where the eligible member has had a continuous break in active membership of a public service pension scheme of more than 5 years that began after the member’s active membership of the inactive pension account that has been aggregated with the eligible member’s active pension account ceased.

(4) The administering authority must obtain advice from an actuary before determining what additional benefits to pay to a member.

(2) Where compensation payable under section 82(1) or 83(1) (indirect compensation) of PSPJOA 2022 is in respect of a Part 4 tax loss mentioned in direction 34(4)(a) or (b) or 36(3)(a) or (b) of the PSP Directions 2022, the application mentioned in paragraph (1) must include the following—
(a)

(a)
that individual is unable to recover from HMRC the amount of overpaid income tax paid in relation to that tax year by that individual that gives rise to their Part 4 tax loss, and
(b)
the reason for that is because the individual may no longer make a claim under the Income Tax Acts to recover from HMRC the amount of overpaid income tax because the statutory time limit has passed.

(3) Where the recalculated death grant exceeds the death grant that has already been paid in respect of the person, the difference is to be paid by the administering authority, without undue delay—
(a)
where there was a single recipient of the death grant, to that recipient; or
(b)
where there was more than one recipient, to those recipients in the same proportions as they were paid the death grant.Survivor benefits in respect of members who died before 1 October 2023

(b)
where the person is in category C and a survivor member’s pension, including any survivor guarantee amount, payable in respect of the person exceeds the annual rate of the survivor member’s pension which was previously payable, the difference is to be added to the survivor member’s pension account in question without undue delay.

(7) Where the actuaries agree that a payment must be made, it should be made without undue delay to the trustees or managers of the new scheme for the benefit of the person.

At 11.28 a.m. on 30th August 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25) (“the 2013 Act”) makes provision, and confers further powers to make provision (in the form of “scheme regulations” as defined in section 1 of that Act) about the establishment of public service pension schemes. The Local Government Pension Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (S.S.I. 2018/141, “the 2018 Regulations”) are the scheme regulations consolidating the Local Government Pension Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2014, which established the successor local government pension scheme (“the 2015 Scheme”) to the pension scheme constituted by the Local Government Pension Scheme (Administration) (Scotland) Regulations 2008, the Local Government Pension Scheme (Benefits, Membership and Contributions) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 and the Local Government Pension Scheme (Transitional Provisions) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 (“the 2009 Scheme”). The Local Government Pension Scheme (Transitional Provisions and Savings) (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (S.S.I. 2014/233, “the 2014 Regulations”) provide transitional protection (“the statutory underpin”) for 2009 Scheme members. Similar transitional protection was made under the 2013 Act for members of judicial pension schemes and members of firefighters pension schemes. The transitional protection for members of the judicial and firefighters schemes was subsequently found to unlawfully discriminate between members of the respective schemes on the basis of age. Although the statutory underpin was not subject to legal action, all schemes established under the 2013 Act are subject to review. These Regulations do this in relation to the 2015 Scheme.
The Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7) (“PSPJOA 2022”), at Chapter 3 of Part 1, makes provision, and confers powers for scheme regulations under the 2013 Act to make further provision, in relation to specified service (“remediable service”, as defined in section 77 of PSPJOA 2022) of members who benefitted from the statutory underpin or who did not by reason of their age. Section 85 of PSPJOA 2022 requires certain powers in chapter 3 of Part 1 to be exercised in accordance with Treasury Directions.
These Regulations are scheme regulations under the 2013 Act and in accordance with PSPJOA 2022 in relation to a member’s remediable service in the local government legacy schemes and the 2015 Scheme. They are, to the extent required by section 85 of PSPJOA 2022, made in accordance with Treasury Directions (in the form of the Public Service Pensions (Exercise of Powers, Compensation and Information) Directions 2022). These Regulations have retrospective effect, which is authorised by section 3(3)(b) of the 2013 Act.
Part 1 of these Regulations makes general provision.
Part 2 amends the 2014 Regulations in relation to the statutory underpin:
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 1 of the 2014 Regulations and introduces the concept of the “final guarantee amount”. This is the amount by which a member’s benefits under the 2015 Scheme (as assessed in accordance with the amendments made by these Regulations) are exceeded by the amount the member should have been entitled under the local government legacy schemes.
Regulation 2(3) omits regulation 4 of those regulations (which contained the original provision relating to the statutory underpin).
Regulation 2(4) inserts regulations 4A to 4T, which, by their effect, replace regulation 4:
Regulation 4A makes provision in relation to the application of the replacement statutory underpin provisions to certain members (“eligible members”) and in respect of a certain period (“the underpin period”).
Regulation 4B makes provision for eligible members who become entitled to a pension on the basis of retirement, redundancy, or ill health to have their pension account increased by the final guarantee amount on the day after they become so entitled.
Regulation 4C makes provision for eligible members who become entitled to a pension on the basis of taking flexible retirement under regulation 29(7) of the 2018 Regulations to have their pension account increased by the final guarantee amount on the day after they become so entitled. It makes further provision relating to the ability of an eligible member taking flexible retirement to elect to take less than 100% of the pension to which they are entitled.
Regulation 4D prevents eligible members who take a lump sum payment from having their pension account increased by the final guarantee amount relating to the pension account.
Regulation 4E prevents eligible members who transfer to a different scheme from having a final guarantee amount determined in relation to their pension account.
Regulation 4F prevents eligible members who take a repayment of contributions from having a final guarantee amount calculated in respect of those repaid contributions.
Regulation 4G provides for an “underpin date” to be determined in respect of eligible members. The underpin date is the date in respect of which a provisional calculation of the member’s benefits under the 2015 Scheme and the 2009 Scheme in respect of the underpin period is made.
Regulation 4H provides for a “final underpin date” to be determined in respect of eligible members. The final underpin date is the date in respect of which the final calculation of the eligible members benefits under the 2015 Scheme and 2009 Scheme is made, out of which the final guarantee amount is calculated.
Regulation 4I contains the calculation of an eligible member’s provisional assumed benefits. This is the provisional calculation of the benefits a member is entitled to under the 2015 Scheme.
Regulation 4J contains the calculation of an eligible member’s provisional underpin amount. This is the provisional calculation of the benefits a member should otherwise have been entitled to under the 2009 Scheme.
Regulation 4K provides for the calculation of an eligible member’s “final assumed benefits” for the purpose of the statutory underpin. This is the final calculation of the benefits the person is entitled to under the 2015 Scheme.
Regulation 4L provides for the calculation of an eligible member’s “final underpin amount” for the purpose of the statutory underpin. This is the final calculation of the benefits the person should otherwise have been entitled to under the 2009 Scheme.
Regulation 4M makes provision for the calculation of a “survivor guarantee amount” and for that amount to be added to a survivor member’s pension in respect of a deceased eligible member’s entitlement to a final guarantee amount.
Regulation 4N makes provision for the calculation of a “deferred guarantee amount” relating to an eligible member who is deceased and for that amount to be included in the calculation of a death grant payable in respect of the member.
Regulation 4O makes provision in relation to the calculation of provisional assumed benefits and provisional underpin amount for eligible members who have a pension account that has been aggregated from two or more pension accounts.
Regulation 4P makes provision for the calculation of the cash equivalent value of an eligible member’s relevant benefits (as defined in section 29 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (c. 30)) where the eligible member is divorced or dissolves a civil partnership.
Regulation 4Q empowers an administering authority to pay additional benefits under the 2015 Scheme, instead of an amount under section 82 of PSPJOA 2022, in respect of a compensatable loss that is a Part 4 tax loss.
Regulation 4R prevents an administering authority from paying an amount under section 82 of PSPJOA 2022, or additional benefits under regulation 4Q, unless the eligible member concerned or their personal representatives have made an application. It makes provision for the contents of such an application, requires administering authorities to determine the amounts payable to the eligible member or their personal representatives, and for appeals against such determinations.
Regulation 4S provides that compensation under section 82 of PSPJOA 2022 or regulation 4Q may be paid from the pension fund concerned.
Regulation 4T makes provision for the payment of interest in respect of the payment of an additional benefit under regulation 4Q.
Regulation 2(5) amends regulation 9 of the 2014 Regulations to provide that where a transfer payment is received into the 2015 Scheme, which includes a payment in respect of remediable service, in respect of a person from a different public service pension scheme, that payment entitles the person to benefits under the 2015 Scheme. So long as there has been no continuous break of more than 5 years in active membership since the remediable service was accrued, the transferred remediable service is included in the calculation of the provisional assumed benefits and the provisional underpin amount.
Regulation 3 makes consequential amendments to the 2018 Regulations, including the following:
Regulation 3(2) amends regulation 29 to provide that the enhancement of a member’s pension received after their normal pension age, reduction, where the member receives their pension early, or adjustment, where the member reduces working hours or grade, does not apply to any final guarantee amount which has been added to the pension account in question.
Regulation 3(3) amends regulation 33 to provide that the pension used to calculate a member’s commutation payments may under certain circumstances include a final guarantee amount or a survivor guarantee amount.
Regulation 3(4), (5), (7), (8), (9) and (10) exclude the final guarantee amount to which an eligible member may otherwise have been entitled from the pension the member would have been entitled to for the purpose of the calculation of survivor benefits.
Regulation 3(6) makes similar provision in relation to death grants.
Regulation 3(11) and (12) provides that compensation paid under section 82 of PSPJOA 2022 or additional benefits paid under regulation 4Q are liabilities for the purpose of actuarial valuations of a pension fund’s liabilities.
Regulation 3(13) amends regulation 76 to disapply its provisions on the payment of interest in relation to sums in respect of which interest is payable under regulation 4T of the 2014 Regulations or regulation 14 of these Regulations.
Regulation 3(14) amends regulation 91 to provide that, where a non-Club Transfer out of the pension fund is applied for by an eligible member under paragraph (1) of that regulation, the value of the transfer is to be calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers, taking into account the member’s provisional underpin amount and provisional assumed benefits.
Regulation 3(16) provides that an actuary determining the amount of a bulk transfer payment must take into account the member’s provisional underpin amount and provisional assumed benefits.
Part 3 makes retrospective provision.
Regulation 4 makes general provision, including the persons to whom, or in respect of, the retrospective provision is made.
Regulation 5 makes provision in relation to members who retired or died before 1 October 2023. It is to be determined whether the person should be entitled to a final guarantee amount. If so, the amount is to be paid to the member’s pension account or personal representatives.
Regulation 6 makes provision in relation to death grants in respect of members who died before 1 October 2023. Provisional assumed benefits and a provisional underpin amount are to be calculated in respect of the member and regulation 41 of the 2018 regulations is to be applied to recalculate the death grant, with any excess being paid to the original recipients of the death grant.
Regulation 7 makes provision in relation to pensioner member death grants in respect of members who died before 1 October 2023. The death grant payable in respect of the person is to be recalculated under regulation 44 of the 2018 regulations and the amount is to be paid to the original recipients of the death grant.
Regulation 8 makes provision in relation to survivor benefits in respect of members who died before 1 October 2023. Provisional assumed benefits and a provisional underpin amount are to be calculated in respect of the member and regulation 4M of the 2014 Regulations is to be applied to the person and any survivor guarantee amount is to be added to the original survivor member’s pension account payable under regulation 39, 40, 42, 43, 45 or 46 of the 2018 Regulations.
Regulation 9 makes provision in relation to members who transferred into the fund before 1 October 2023 from certain schemes. Where that transfer results in the person being entitled to benefits or being credited pension under the 2015 Scheme, the transfer is to be treated as a transfer to which regulation 9(1A) and, as the case may be, (1B) of the 2014 Regulations applies.
Regulation 10 makes provision in relation to members who transferred out of the fund before 1 October 2023 under regulation 91 or 93 of the 2018 Regulations. Provisional assumed benefits and a provisional underpin amount are to be calculated in respect of the member and the transfer value is to be recalculated. Where a payment must be made, it is to be made to the trustees or manager of the new scheme for the benefit of the person.
Regulation 11 provides that where a person took a trivial commutation payment or lump sum under regulation 33(1) of the 2018 Regulations before 1 October 2023, it is to be determined whether the person is entitled to a final guarantee amount in accordance with regulations 4A to 4T of the 2014 Regulations.
Regulation 12 makes provision in relation to members who divorced or dissolved a civil partnership before 1 October 2023. The cash equivalent value of the person’s relevant benefits (for the purpose of section 29 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999) is to be recalculated in accordance with actuarial guidance issued by the Scottish Ministers. Where the recalculated amount exceeds the original calculation, the annual pension awarded to the member’s spouse or civil partner is to be recalculated based on that amount.
Regulation 13 makes provision for a member with underpin dates (within the meaning of regulation 4G of the 2014 Regulations) that occur before 1 October 2023, but who do not have a final underpin date (within the meaning of regulation 4H of those Regulations) before that date. This regulation makes provision for the calculation of a provisional underpin amount and provisional assumed benefits in relation to the member and for the modification of the provision applying a final underpin date to the member.
Regulation 14 makes provision for the payment of interest in respect of sums payable under this Part of the Regulations.

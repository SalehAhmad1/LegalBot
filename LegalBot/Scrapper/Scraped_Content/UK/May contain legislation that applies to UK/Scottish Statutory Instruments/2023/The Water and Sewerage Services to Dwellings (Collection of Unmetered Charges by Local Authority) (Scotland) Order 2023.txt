(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes each local authority (and not Scottish Water) responsible for the collection of the charges payable for water services and sewerage services which are provided by Scottish Water to dwellings within each financial year (“service year”) from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2028. It also requires each authority to make payments to Scottish Water so as to account for this.
Article 3 requires each local authority to collect the charges payable in respect of water and sewerage services provided to dwellings in its area (“the services”), but this collection duty does not apply to dwellings where the provision of water services is charged on a metered basis.
Article 4 provides that, in respect of the services provided by Scottish Water within each service year, a local authority must pay to Scottish Water a sum (determined by a formula) to account for the amounts collected by the authority in respect of the services provided in the authority’s area.
Articles 5 requires each sum payable under article 4 to be paid in instalments, and sets out the amount and timing of each instalment.
Articles 6 to 8 set out the forms and procedures for demanding payment. Articles 9 and 10 make provision for appeals. Article 11 makes provision in relation to keeping accounts and records.

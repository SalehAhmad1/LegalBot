(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Deer (Close Seasons) (Scotland) Order 2011 by substituting a new table in the schedule which specifies the close seasons for deer.
The effect of this Order is to remove close seasons for male deer. The female close season remains unaltered. It therefore remains an offence under section 5 of the Deer (Scotland) Act 1996 to take, wilfully kill or injure a female deer of the species specified in the table in the schedule during the corresponding close season.

This Order commences various provisions of the Victims and Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2014 (“the 2014 Act”) on 10 February 2021. Sections 23 and 25 are brought into force insofar as they are not already in force.
The full commencement of section 23 brings subsections (7) and (14) of that section into force. Section 23(7) amends section 14 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 to create a power for the Scottish Ministers to prescribe the form and manner of victim statements made under section 14. Section 23(14) amends section 88(2)(b) of the 2003 Act to provide that an order prescribing the form and manner of victim statements is subject to affirmative procedure.
Section 25 of the 2014 Act inserts sections 253A to 253E into the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 and those sections make provision for the introduction of restitution orders and the creation of the restitution fund.

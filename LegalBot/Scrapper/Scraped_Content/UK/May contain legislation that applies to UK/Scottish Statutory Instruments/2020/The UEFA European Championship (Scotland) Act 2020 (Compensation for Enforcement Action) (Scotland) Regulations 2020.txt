(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 26(1) of the UEFA European Championship (Scotland) Act 2020 (“the Act”) provides that a person whose property is damaged by anything done under section 18 (general enforcement power) or 20 (power to enter and search) of the Act may obtain compensation from, depending on the circumstances, Glasgow City Council or the Scottish Police Authority. This entitlement to compensation does not apply if the thing done relates to a Championship offence committed by the person.
These Regulations make provision about claiming compensation and determining the compensation due. They also confer on the sheriff jurisdiction for determining disputed compensation.
Regulation 3 sets out the amount of compensation to which a person is entitled. Regulations 4 to 6 set out the procedure by which compensation may be obtained. Regulations 7 and 8 set out how a decision on a claim may be reviewed, and how a decision on a review can be appealed.
The Regulations cease to have effect on the day that the Act ceases to have effect, 31 December 2020.

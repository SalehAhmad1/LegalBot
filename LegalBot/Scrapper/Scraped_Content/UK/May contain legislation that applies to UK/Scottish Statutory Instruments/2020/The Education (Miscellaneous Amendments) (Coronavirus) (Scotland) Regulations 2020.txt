It also amends time limits relating to the hearing of appeals by education appeal committees against those decisions and decisions on exclusions of pupils.
Regulation 3 amends time limits in the Education (Appeal Committee Procedures) (Scotland) Regulations 1982 relating to the hearing by education appeal committees of references from education authority decisions. It also makes other amendments to the procedure set out in those regulations, including to provide for hearings to be conducted remotely and for references to be considered by appeal committees on the basis of written representations by the parties.
Regulation 4 amends time limits in the Additional Support for Learning (Placing Requests and Deemed Decisions) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 relating to education authorities’ decisions on placing requests made under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004.

12th November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations partially suspend the operation of section 16 (duty of local authority to assess needs: Scotland) of the Coronavirus Act 2020 (“the 2020 Act”) insofar it relates to adult social care and adult carers. The partial suspension of section 16 of the 2020 Act means that the suspended provisions no longer have effect in Scotland but are capable of being revived under section 88(3) of the 2020 Act.
Regulation 2 suspends the following provisions—
section 16(1) and (2) (which permits a local authority to dispense with its duty to conduct a needs assessments under section 12A of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 if it would be impractical or cause delay in the provision of community care services),
section 16(4)(a) and (b) (which permits a local authority to dispense with its duty to prepare an adult carer support plan under section 6 of the Carers (Scotland) Act 2016 (“the 2016 Act”) if it would be impractical or cause delay in the provision of support), and
section 16(4)(e) insofar it relates to an adult carer (which permits a local authority not to comply with section 1 of the Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013 insofar it relates to Part 2 and 3 of the 2016 Act).
Regulation 3 provides for the transition where a local authority has relied on section 16(1) of the 2020 Act, together with either section 16(2)(a) or 16(2)(b), and provided community care services to a person. The local authority must continue to provide those services until it fulfils the duty to assess the person’s needs or the person no longer has a requirement for those services.
Regulation 4 provides for the transition where a local authority has relied on section 16(3) of the 2020 Act, together with either section 16(4)(a) or 16(4)(b) or, insofar as it applies to an adult carer, section 16(4)(3), in relation to a person and provided support to that person. The local authority must continue to provide that support until it has prepared an adult carer support plan, the person no longer has a requirement for support, the person has refused the offer of an adult carer support plan or the person’s existing adult carer support plan has been reviewed under the Carers (Scotland) Act 2016 (Review of Adult Carer Support Plan and Young Carer Statement) Regulations 2018.

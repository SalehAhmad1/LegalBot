Paragraph (2) updates a reference to Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators (“the Batteries Directive”). Paragraphs (3) and (4) update obligations relating to the co-mingling of waste to better align the language to that in the Waste Framework Directive.
Regulation 3 amends the Special Waste Regulations 1996. Paragraph (2) updates a reference to the Waste Framework Directive. Paragraph (3) removes the requirement that economic feasibility be a factor in deciding whether illegally mixed hazardous waste must be separated.
Regulation 4 amends the Landfill (Scotland) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”), updating references to Directive 1999/31/EC on the Landfill of Waste (“the Landfill Directive”) the Batteries Directive and the Waste Framework Directive, and aligning the definition of “municipal waste” with that in the Waste Framework Directive.

Regulation 7 amends the Waste Management Licensing (Scotland) Regulations 2011 (“the 2011 Regulations”). Paragraph (2) inserts a definition of “back-filling” to align the definition of recycling in the 2011 Regulations with that in the Waste Framework Directive, and updates references to the Batteries Directive and the Waste Framework Directive. Paragraph (3) inserts a new requirement to take into account good practices when separately collecting waste oils alongside the existing requirement to collect waste oils separately and removes some redundant provisions. Paragraph (4) amends the interpretation provision to further align the language with that used in the Directive.
Regulation 8 amends the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2012. Paragraphs (2) and (3) update references to the Landfill Directive, the Batteries Directive and the Waste Framework Directive. Paragraph (4) inserts a new requirement to take into account good practices when separately collecting waste oils alongside the existing requirement to collect waste oils separately.

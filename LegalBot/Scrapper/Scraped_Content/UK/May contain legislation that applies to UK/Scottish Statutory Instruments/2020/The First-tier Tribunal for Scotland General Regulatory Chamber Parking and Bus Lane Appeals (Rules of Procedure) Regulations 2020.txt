an appellant who had failed to appear or be represented at a hearing had good and sufficient reason for the appellant’s failure to appear,

(This note does not form part of the Regulations)
The Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014 created a new structure for tribunals dealing with devolved matters under the judicial leadership of the Lord President of the Court of Session as head of the Scottish Tribunals.
It provided for a First-tier Tribunal and an Upper Tribunal and for the First-tier Tribunal to be divided into chambers dependent on the subject-matter of the case before it and similarly for the Upper Tribunal to be divided into divisions. The First-tier Tribunal has been divided into chambers, one of which is the General Regulatory Chamber.
Paragraph 4 of schedule 9 of the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014 enables the Scottish Ministers, by regulations, to make Tribunal Rules until such time as the provisions of the 2014 Act conferring responsibility on the Scottish Civil Justice Council and the Court of Session for the making of Tribunal Rules are commenced.
These Regulations provide for the rules of procedure which are to apply in the General Regulatory Chamber when hearing appeals against decisions of a local authority to issue parking penalty charge notices or bus lane charge notices. The rules of procedure are set out in the schedule of the Regulations.

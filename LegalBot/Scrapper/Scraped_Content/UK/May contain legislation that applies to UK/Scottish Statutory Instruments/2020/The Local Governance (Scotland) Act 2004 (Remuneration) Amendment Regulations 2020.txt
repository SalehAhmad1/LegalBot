(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 (Remuneration) Regulations 2007. They substitute increased annual amounts for different categories of local authority remuneration to their members. These changes are effective from 1 April 2020.
Regulation 2(2) makes provision for councillors who are granted a period of leave of absence by their local authority. It disapplies such councillors from the limits on the number of councillors who can receive certain types of remuneration. The effect is that if, for example, an authority agrees that its Civic Head can be absent from duties for a period (such as for maternity or paternity reasons), the authority can continue to remunerate the councillor who has been granted leave, but also pay that type of remuneration to another councillor for undertaking the duties to which it relates.
Regulation 2(3) makes provision for Council Leaders’ remuneration.
Regulation 2(4) provides new maximum levels for remuneration of Civic Heads. It is for each local authority to determine whether and to what extent such remuneration should be paid.
Regulation 2(5) sets new levels for councillors’ remuneration.
Regulation 2(6) sets new levels of remuneration for councillors who perform the role of convener or vice-convener of a joint board.

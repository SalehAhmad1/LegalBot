(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations (which, with the exception of regulation 8, come into force on at 6.00 p.m. on 11 December 2020) amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions and Requirements) (Local Levels) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the principal regulations”) and make a temporary modification of the principal regulations.
Regulation 3 inserts a definition of County Donegal in connection with regulations 5 and 7.
Regulation 4 modifies regulation 3A of the principal regulations so that, in relation to certain islands, it is permitted to hold gatherings indoors in private dwellings in certain circumstances.
Regulation 5 modifies regulation 3B of the principal regulations so that the temporary modifications in regulation 3B, in relation to reasonable excuse for contravening the travel restrictions in a Level 3 or Level 4 area, are extended to cover travel to the Republic of Ireland or Jersey and, in relation to the common travel area, reflect the changes to the common travel area made by regulation 7.
Regulation 6 changes the levels of restrictions and requirements which apply in the local authority areas listed in paragraphs (2), (4) and (6). The restrictions and requirements applicable in relation to the different levels are set out in schedules 1 to 5 of the principal regulations.
Regulation 7 amends schedule 7A of the principal regulations so that the restrictions in relation to the common travel area apply to County Donegal (and no longer apply to the rest of the Republic of Ireland) and Jersey.
Regulation 8 provides for a temporary lifting of the restriction on betting shops, premises which provide close contact services and retail and library premises in Level 4 areas, and this regulation comes into force at 6.00 a.m. on 11 December 2020.

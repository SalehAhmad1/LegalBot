17th November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made principally in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraphs 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 and paragraph 21(b) of schedule 7 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. These Regulations address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Regulation 2 is made in exercise of powers under the European Communities Act 1972, and amends the definition of “qualification certificate” in the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (Scotland) Regulations 2012 to update the list of qualification authorities who issue qualification certificates that are recognised in Scotland for the purposes of obtaining a certificate of competence. This amendment comes into force immediately before IP completion day.
Regulation 3 is made in exercise of powers under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, and makes amendments to the Animal Health (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019, which in turn make amendments to secondary legislation in the field of animal health. These amendments to the Animal Health (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 are required so as to prevent, remedy or mitigate deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. These amendments come into force immediately before IP completion day.
Regulation 4 is made in exercise of powers under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, and makes amendments to the Official Controls (Agriculture etc.) (Scotland) Regulations 2019 in order to prevent, remedy or mitigate deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. These amendments come into force on IP completion day.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

Laid before the Scottish Parliament
17th December 2020
Coming into force

The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972(1) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
(1)
1972 c.68 (“the 1972 Act”). The 1972 Act was repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) (“the 2018 Act”) with effect from exit day (see section 20 of the 2018 Act), but saved subject to modifications, until IP completion day by section 1A of the 2018 Act. Section 1A of the 2018 Act was inserted by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c.1) (“the 2020 Act”), and defines “IP completion day” by reference to section 39(1) to (5) of the 2020 Act. Section 2(2) of the 1972 Act was amended by paragraph 15(3) of schedule 8 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c.46) (“the 1998 Act”), (which was amended by section 27(4) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c.51) (“the 2006 Act”)). Section 2(2) of the 1972 Act was also amended by section 27(1) of the 2006 Act and by section 3(3) and Part 1 of the schedule of the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c.7). The functions conferred upon a Minister of the Crown under section 2(2), insofar as within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act.Citation and commencement

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations partially implement Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants (recast) (“the EU Regulation”) by amending the Environmental Protection (Disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyls and other Dangerous Substances) (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (“the 2000 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(3)(b) amends regulation 4 of the 2000 Regulations by replacing paragraph (3) with new paragraphs (3A) to (3D). The new paragraphs (3A) and (3B) allow transformers that contain 0.005% by weight, or less, of PCBs or a total volume of 0.05 dm3, or less, of PCBs to be held until the end their useful life. The new paragraphs (3C) and (3D) allow transformers containing more than 0.005%, but no more than 0.05% by weight of PCBs, and a total volume of more than 0.05 dm3 of PCBs to be held until 31 December 2025. They must then be decontaminated or disposed of, as soon as possible.
Regulation 2(3)(d) amends regulation 4 of the 2000 Regulations by replacing paragraph (9) with new paragraphs (9) to (14). The new paragraphs (9) and (10) apply to equipment containing PCBs not covered by paragraphs (2) to (3D), (5) and (11) to (12) which is not contaminated equipment and which is part of other equipment (which is itself also not contaminated equipment). The new paragraphs (11) and (12) apply to equipment containing PCBs not covered by paragraphs (2) to (3D), (5) and (9) to (10) which is “relevant equipment” which is part of other equipment (which is itself also relevant equipment). A definition of “relevant equipment” is inserted.
The remaining provisions make related changes to the 2000 Regulations, in particular to regulation 5 (labelling of contaminated equipment) and regulation 13 (offences and penalties).

Paragraph 12(3B) of schedule 3 of the 2016 Act requires the First-tier Tribunal, in considering for the purposes whether it is reasonable to issue an eviction order against the tenant, to consider the extent to which the landlord has complied with pre-action requirements before applying for the eviction order.
Regulations 3 and 4 specify the pre-action requirements.
Regulations 5 and 6 specify that the pre-action requirements apply to proceedings for recovery of possession or to applications for an eviction order which are commenced by the landlord on or after 6 October 2020.

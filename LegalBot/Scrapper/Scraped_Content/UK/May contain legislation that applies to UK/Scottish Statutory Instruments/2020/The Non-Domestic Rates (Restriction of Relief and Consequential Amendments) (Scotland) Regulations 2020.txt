EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide that any relief that would otherwise be granted by Regulations under section 153 of the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 is not granted, from 1 January 2021, if it would be incompatible with Article 107(1) of the Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
Article 107 lays down conditions for the assessment of state aid. The effect is that those conditions will continue to apply for the purposes of non-domestic rate reliefs, as that Article has effect on the day these Regulations are made.
In consequence, regulations 3 to 10 amend Regulations made under section 153 of that Act, to omit references to that Article that are no longer necessary.

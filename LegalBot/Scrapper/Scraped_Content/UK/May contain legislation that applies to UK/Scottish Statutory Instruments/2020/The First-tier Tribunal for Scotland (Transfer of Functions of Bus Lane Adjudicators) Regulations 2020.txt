(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for the transfer to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland General Regulatory Chamber of the functions of bus lane adjudicators. A person appointed as a parking adjudicator by Part 2 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 is also a bus lane adjudicator by virtue of regulation 11(a) of the Bus Lane Contraventions (Charges, Adjudication and Enforcement) (Scotland) Regulations 2011 in relation to bus lane contraventions by motor vehicles as set out in section 44(3) of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001.
The First-tier Tribunal was established by section 1 of the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014. It is divided into chambers, with the chambers hearing cases according to their subject-matter. The First-tier Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber already has functions transferred from the Scottish Charity Appeals Panel. On 1 April 2020, bus lane adjudicators will transfer into, and become legal members of, the General Regulatory Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal.
Transitional provisions are made to manage the transfer of on-going casework. These Regulations also make consequential amendments to legislation.

EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)
This Act of Sederunt amends the court rules in Chapter 74 of the Rules of the Court of Session 1994 and the Act of Sederunt (Sheriff Court Company Insolvency Rules) 1986.
The court rules are amended in consequence of the provisions of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (c.12) (“the 2020 Act”). The 2020 Act makes amendments to the Insolvency Act 1986 (c.45) to remove Schedule A1 and enact a new Part A1 concerned with moratoriums on corporate insolvency proceedings. A moratorium may be obtained either by lodging certain documents with the court or, in some cases, by formal application to the court. A number of ancillary court remedies are created and the amendments to the court rules make provision for how they are to be sought from the court.
The 2020 Act also temporarily amends the law in relation to liquidation so that where a liquidation petition is lodged which falls within paragraph 20 of schedule 10 of the 2020 Act, court rules which require or permit notice, publication, advertisement or inspection of the petition or proceedings do not apply until the court makes a determination under paragraph 20(2). Provision is made in paragraph 20(3) of schedule 10 for the court to disapply paragraph 20(2) so far as relating to inspection of the petition or proceedings. The court rules are accordingly amended to provide that such an application is to be made by note in the process of the petition.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under the Census Act 1920. It makes provision for a census to be held in Scotland under that Act.
Article 3 provides for the census to be taken on 21 March 2021 (census day).
Article 4 provides for returns to be made with respect to persons alive at midnight at the end of census day.
Article 5 prescribes the persons by whom returns are to me made. It does so by reference to Groups described in schedule 1 according to the premises or other place for which, and the persons with respect to whom, census returns are to be made.
Article 6 and schedules 2 and 3 prescribe the particulars which are to be stated in different types of census return.
Article 7 prescribes certain particulars (those relating to transgender status or history) for the purposes of section 8(1A) of the Census Act 1920. This disapplies some of the penalty provisions in the section 8 in relation to those particulars so that stating those particulars on a census return will be voluntary.

SCHEDULEEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)
This Act of Sederunt makes provision about group procedure, as provided by Part 4 of the Civil Litigation (Expenses and Group Proceedings) (Scotland) Act 2018 (“the Act”). Group procedure is a new form of proceedings available in the Court of Session. The instrument amends the Rules of the Court of Session (“the RCS”) by, among other matters, the insertion of new Chapter 26A by paragraph 2(5), and comes into force on 31st July 2020.
General Provisions
Part 1 of Chapter 26A makes general provision. The procedural framework, as provided by rule 26A.3 and Part 7 of Chapter 26A, provides the court with flexibility as to how to deal with these new proceedings efficiently.
Numerous applications are made to the court under the new procedure, by motion. Rule 26A.4 provides that Chapter 23 (motions) of the RCS applies to motions made under Chapter 26A and that they may be intimated and enrolled by email.
Representative Party
The Act provides that a person who is a representative party may bring group proceedings on behalf of a group of persons. Under section 20(3)(b) of the Act a person may be a representative party only if authorised by the court. Part 2 of Chapter 26A, and Forms 26A.5 and 26A.8, makes relevant provision for this.
Permission to bring Group Proceedings
Under section 20(5) of the Act group proceedings may be brought only with the permission of the court. The court may give permission where it is satisfied that the criteria set out in section 20(6)(a) and (b) of the Act are met and, by section 20(6)(c), in accordance with provision made in Part 3 of Chapter 26A. The applicant must, together with an application, lodge the summons by which it is proposed to institute proceedings, a record of group members and relevant supporting documentation. Applications for permission are determined in accordance with rule 26A.11(5). Where the court gives permission for group proceedings to be brought under rule 26A.12, the Lord Ordinary makes an order which sets out certain specified matters about the group. Under rule 26A.13 an appeal against a decision of the court on an application for permission is made by reclaiming motion. By virtue of paragraph 2(6) of the Act of Sederunt leave to reclaim is not required in such appeals.
Opt-in Procedure
The Act of Sederunt provides for group proceedings to be brought as opt-in proceedings under section 20(7)(a) of the Act. Part 4 of Chapter 26A, together with the accompanying Forms, make relevant provision. Under rule 26A.14, notices are sent by potential group members to the representative party (or the person who has applied, or is to apply, to be a representative party), who then records persons who are group members in a group register. Under rule 26A.15, the register must be lodged with the court and served on the defender. The representative party must be satisfied that the person may be a group member before they can record the person as a group member on the register. This includes an assessment of their claim and being satisfied that it raises issues (whether of fact or law) which are the same as, or similar or related, to each other and subject to the proceedings, and being satisfied that their claim has not prescribed before joining the register.
The membership of the group may change during the course of the group proceedings either by the joining of new group members or by the departure from the group of group members. Group members withdraw their consent to their claims being brought in group proceedings in the same way as persons join the group, by the sending of a notice in Form 26A.14-B, to the representative party.
The Act of Sederunt makes provision for the procedure that is to be followed in cases where a person seeks to join or leave a group late in the proceedings or, where their leaving results in there being less than two pursuers, by rules 26A.16 and 26A.17 respectively.
Commencement of Group Proceedings
Part 5 of Chapter 26A makes provision setting out when proceedings are deemed to have commenced by group members in a group proceeding action. It is the point at which the group register is served on the defender or, in the case of eligible persons who join the group proceedings at a later stage, the lodging with the court of a revised group register. Where application is made by a person to join the group proceedings late, and the court allows such application, then it is the point at which the application is made.
Summonses and Defences
Part 6 of Chapter 26A, and Form 13.2-AA, make provision for pleadings in group proceedings. Form 13.2-AA prescribes a new summons Form for these proceedings.
Procedural Framework
Part 7 of Chapter 26A sets out the procedural framework for group proceedings, which comprises preliminary hearings, case management hearings, debates, pre-proof hearings and the lodging of productions for proof.
Withdrawal of Group Members from Group Proceedings
Part 8 of Chapter 26A makes provision setting out the point in group proceedings at which a group member withdraws consent for their claim to be brought in the proceedings. It is the point at which the revised group register is lodged with the court.
Orders of the Court
Part 9 of Chapter 26A makes provision concerning orders of the court in group proceedings. Rule 26A.27 permits the Lord Ordinary to make such orders as are necessary to secure the fair and efficient determination of the proceedings. Provision is made by rule 26A.28 about interlocutors given in group proceedings, and their effect. Rule 26A.29 provides powers to the Lord Ordinary in connection with a failure by a party to comply with the RCS or with any order of the Lord Ordinary in group proceedings.
Settlement
Part 10 of Chapter 26A makes provision about settlement of group proceedings. Under rule 26A.30 the representative party must consult with group members on the terms of any proposed settlement before any damages in connection with the proceedings may be distributed.
Consequential Provision
Consequential amendment of the RCS is made by paragraph 2(2) to (4) and (6) of the Act of Sederunt.
Forms
New Forms are inserted into the appendix to the RCS, and Form 13.7 is amended, by paragraph 2(7) of the Act of Sederunt.

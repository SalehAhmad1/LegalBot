(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the definition of “relevant period” in paragraph 2(1) of schedule 14 of the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“the Act”).
The Act makes provision about meetings of Scottish charitable incorporated organisations (“SCIOs”) to give them more flexibility as to when and how general meetings (such as annual general meetings) and some other meetings are held. The Act allows SCIOs to hold such meetings remotely (regardless of whether that is permitted by their constitutions) in the “relevant period”.
As currently defined the “relevant period” began with 26 March 2020 and would end with 30 December 2020. As amended by these Regulations the “relevant period” is the period which began with 26 March 2020 and will end with 30 March 2021.

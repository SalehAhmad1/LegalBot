This Order amends the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Prescription of Offices, etc. and Specification of Public Authorities) (Scotland) Order 2010 (“the 2010 Order”), which prescribes offices, ranks and positions for the purposes of section 8(1) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”). Under that section individuals holding such offices, ranks and positions as are prescribed may grant authorisations under sections 6 and 7 of the 2000 Act for the use of directed surveillance and covert human intelligence sources respectively.
Specifically, article 2(2) of this Order prescribes persons within the Fraud and Error Resolution Unit of Social Security Scotland (“the Unit”) who hold the position of Team Leader at C1 grade, other than the leader of the team within the Unit which makes authorisation requests. Any person holding a more senior position within the Unit would also be able to grant authorisations, by virtue of article 2(3) of the 2010 Order.
Social Security Scotland is part of the Scottish Administration. The Scottish Administration is a relevant public authority for the purposes of section 8 of the 2000 Act.

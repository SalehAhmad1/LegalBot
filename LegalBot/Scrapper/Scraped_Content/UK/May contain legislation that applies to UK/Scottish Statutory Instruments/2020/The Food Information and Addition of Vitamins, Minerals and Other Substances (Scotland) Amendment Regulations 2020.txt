Coming into force

The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 6(4), 16(1)(a) and (e), 17, 26(1) and (3) and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990(1), section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972(2) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, and it appears to the Scottish Ministers that it is expedient for any reference to specified provisions of—
(a)
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/775 laying down rules for the application of Article 26(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers, as regards the rules for indicating the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient of a food(3), and
(b)
Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods(4),
to be construed as a reference to those provisions of those Regulations as amended from time to time.
In accordance with section 48(4A) of the Food Safety Act 1990(5), the Scottish Ministers have had regard to relevant advice given by Food Standards Scotland.
There has been consultation, as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(6).

The functions of the Secretary of State, in so far as within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act.

20th May 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision to enforce, the requirements of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2018/775 on the provision of food information to consumers, as regards the rules for indicating the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient of a food (“Regulation 2018/775”).
Regulation 2 makes amendments to the Food Information (Scotland) Regulations 2014 to ensure that Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation 2018/775 can be enforced.
The effect of the amendments is that, subject to transitional provisions, it is an offence to fail to comply with Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation 2018/775.
Regulation 3 inserts a new transitional provision (regulation 4A) into the Addition of Vitamins, Minerals and Other Substances (Scotland) Regulations 2007. This has the effect that no offence is committed in respect of any food placed on the market before 1st April 2021 that does not comply with the provisions relating to artificial trans fats in Annex III, Part B of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods. This reflects the transitional provision contained in article 4 of Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/649 of 24 April 2019 amending Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards trans fat, other than trans fat naturally occurring in fat of animal origin.
A full business and regulatory impact assessment of the effect these Regulations will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector has been prepared and placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.

Made
23rd December 2020
Coming into force
24th December 2020
The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 28(2), 81(8) and 95 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018(1) (“the 2018 Act”), section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972(2), section 13 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020(3) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
In accordance with section 97(2) of the 2018 Act, the Scottish Ministers have informed the Scottish Commission on Social Security (“the Commission”) of their proposals, notified the Scottish Parliament that they have done so and made their proposals publicly available by such means as they consider appropriate.
The Scottish Ministers have laid a response to the Commission’s report on the proposals for the regulations in accordance with section 97(9)(a) of the 2018 Act.
In accordance with section 96(2) of the 2018 Act and paragraphs 2 and 2A of schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972, a draft of this instrument has been laid before and approved by resolution of the Scottish Parliament(4).

1972 c.68. Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”) was amended by paragraph 15(3) of schedule 8 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c.46) (“the 1998 Act”) (which was amended by section 27(4) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c.51) (“the 2006 Act”)). Section 2(2) was also amended by section 27(1)(a) of the 2006 Act and by Part 1 of the schedule of the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c.7). Section 2(2) was repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) from 31 January 2020. However, the obligations under section 2(1) of the 1972 Act, which may be implemented via section 2(2), are subject to savings provision under section 4(1) of the 2018 Act. The use of section 2(2) is preserved by section 1A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, until IP completion day, being 31 December 2020 at 11:00pm, as defined in section 39(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020. The powers in section 2(2) are exercised as regards regulations 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, and schedule 2 (other than paragraph 15) of these Regulations, so far as they apply to determinations as to whether the conditions in section 81(9) of the Social Security (Scotland) Act (“the 2018 Act”) are met. The functions conferred upon the Minister of the Crown under section 2(2), insofar as within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act. The transfer is in terms of regulation 4 of S.I. 2017/444, which causes section 53(1) and (2) of the 1998 Act to have effect in relation to pre-commencement enactments, within the meaning of section 32 of the Scotland Act 2016 (c.11) as read with section 22(2) of that Act, relating to carer’s benefits, upon commencement of a provision which relies on the exception in relation to carer’s benefits in Section F1 of Part 2 of schedule 5 of the 1998 Act. Section 81 of the 2018 Act was commenced on 3 September 2018 by regulation 2 of S.S.I. 2018/250. Accordingly, responsibility for the exercise of functions in relation to carer’s benefits, within the meaning of section 22 of the Scotland Act 2016 (c.11), has transferred to the Scottish Ministers.
(3)
2020 c.1.
(4)
The powers to make these Regulations are exercised together by virtue of section 33(2) of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (asp 10). These Regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure by virtue of section 33(3) of that Act. Paragraph 2 of schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68) has been amended by section 27(2)(a) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c.51). Paragraph 2A of the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68) has been modified by paragraph 5 of schedule 3 of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (asp 10).Citation and commencement

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations extend provision of both Carer’s Allowance Supplement (“CAS”) and Young Carer Grants (“YCG”). In relation to YCG, these Regulations extend the circumstances in which a person may claim YCG from outside the UK. In relation to CAS, these Regulations provide for claims from outside the UK for the first time.
These Regulations seek to ensure that the rules on social security co-ordination provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1408/71 of 14 June 1971(1) on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004(2) on the coordination of social security system are given full effect. This relates, in particular, to Article 19 of Regulation 1408/71 and Article 21 of Regulation 883/2004. These deal with claims made for cash sickness benefits by persons resident in a state other than the state which is competent for payment of such benefits to them. The power in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 is exercised for this purpose as regards regulations 4 and 5, as well as regulations 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and schedule 2 other than paragraph 15, in so far as they are applied to determinations as to whether the conditions in new section 81(9) of the Social Security (Scotland) Act (“the 2018 Act”) are met.
Regulation 11(4) inserts new paragraph (5) into regulation 8 of the Carer’s Assistance (Young Carer Grant) (Scotland) Regulations 2019 (“the Young Carer Grants Regulations”), and paragraph 5 of schedule 1 of these Regulations inserts new subsection (11) into section 81 of the 2018 Act. These provisions look to ensure that the provision on social security co-ordination in Title III of Part 2 of the EU withdrawal agreement is given effect to, along with that in Part III of the EEA EFTA separation agreement, Part 3 of the Swiss citizens’ rights agreement, and the exchange of letters between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Gibraltar on arrangements for social security co-ordination. The provision in regulation 11(4) where it inserts new paragraph (6) into regulation 8 of the Young Carer Grants Regulations, and paragraph 5 of schedule 1 where it inserts new subsection (13) into section 81 of the 2018 Act, ensures that the entitlement of those covered by the convention on social security between the UK and Ireland is also provided for.
In terms of CAS, the extension in provision is by amendment of section 81 of the 2018 Act relating to payment of CAS, along with provisions within Part 2 and schedule 2 of these Regulations. The amendments to the 2018 Act, found in schedule 1 of these Regulations, modify the definition of a “qualifying individual” so that persons resident out with Scotland, who would otherwise be entitled to receive CAS, may now be included within the definition where they satisfy the eligibility criteria. The addition of section 81(9), (11) and (13) to the 2018 Act details the eligibility criteria for such persons. The Scottish Ministers have a duty, in terms of regulations 5 to 9, to make a determination of an individual’s entitlement to CAS, either on receiving an application or, when required by these Regulations, to make a determination without an application.
In terms of YCG, Part 3 of these Regulations makes amendments to the Young Carer Grants Regulations, so that persons who are not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom may be entitled to a YCG if they satisfy the eligibility criteria detailed in regulation 8 (4) or as the case may be (5) or (6), as inserted by these Regulations into the Young Carer Grants Regulations. Provision is also made so that persons who have met the new criteria in regulation 8(4) may make an application to receive a YCG for any 13 week period which falls within the period commencing with the day that the Young Carer Grants Regulations came into force, and ending with the day that these Regulations came into force. This is to allow for persons to now apply for the periods for which they would have been eligible for a YCG, had the benefit been capable of being claimed from outside the UK, on this basis, at the time the Young Carer Grant Regulations came into force. The Regulations enable applications for past periods of care to be made in any order, while maintaining the position for YCG claims from within Scotland that a carer may only receive one YCG in any 12 month period.
Schedule 2 makes further provision about matters of procedure for applying for, and determining entitlement to, a carer’s allowance supplement for the purposes of section 81(2A) of the 2018 Act, including challenging determinations.

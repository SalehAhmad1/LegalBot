Laid before the Scottish Parliament
at 4.30 p.m. on 21st December 2020
Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1
The Scottish Ministers make these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred on them by section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972(1), paragraphs 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 and paragraph 21(b) of schedule 7 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018(2) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, and it appears to the Scottish Ministers that it is expedient for the reference in regulation 2 to the Commission Regulation to be a reference to that instrument as amended from time to time.
In accordance with paragraph 4(a) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2020(3), the Scottish Ministers consulted the Secretary of State prior to the making of these Regulations.
There has been consultation as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(4).

1972 c.68 (“the 1972 Act”).

Section 1A of the 2018 Act was inserted by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c.1) (“the 2020 Act”), and defines “IP completion day” by reference to section 39(1) to (5) of the 2020 Act. Section 2(2) was amended by the Scotland Act 1998 (c.46) (“the 1998 Act”), schedule 8, paragraph 15(3) (which was amended by section 27(4) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c.51) (“the 2006 Act”)). Section 2(2) was also amended by section 27(1)(a) of the 2006 Act and by the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c.7) (“the 2008 Act”), section 3(3) and schedule 1, Part 1. Paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 was inserted by section 28 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and amended by Part 1 of the Schedule to the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 and S.I. 2007/1388. The functions conferred upon the Minister of the Crown under section 2(2), insofar as within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act.

At 1.45 p.m. on 21st December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of powers under the European Communities Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”) and powers conferred by paragraphs 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 and paragraph 21(b) of schedule 7 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”). These Regulations make amendments before IP completion day to secondary legislation made under section 2(2) of the 1972 Act and address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Part 2 of these Regulations amend secondary legislation in exercise of powers under section 2(2) of the 1972 Act. Regulation 2 amends the Official Feed and Food Controls (Scotland) Regulations 2009 to give effect to Article 79(2)(c) of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 which was previously considered unnecessary but on reflection is required. Regulation 3 amends the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Scotland) Regulations 2012 to insert a regulation introducing and giving effect to schedule 2 of those Regulations. Regulation 4 amends the Official Feed and Food Controls (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 to provide for the execution and enforcement of the delegated and implementing regulations under Regulation (EU) 2017/625. Regulation 4(2) amends Schedule 1 for clarity and Regulation 4(4) amends Schedule 6 to remove four offences.
Part 3 of these Regulations amends secondary EU Exit legislation in exercise of powers under paragraphs 1(1) and 3 of schedule 2 of the 2018 Act. Regulation 3 amends the Food and Feed (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively arising as a result of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Part 4 of these Regulations amend Commission Decision 2000/572/EC in exercise of powers under paragraphs 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 and paragraph 21(b) of schedule 7 of the 2018 Act, in particular to deal with deficiencies under section 8(2)(d) of the 2018 Act. Commission Decision 2000/572/EC concerns the animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions for imports of meat preparations. The amendments provide that the conditions for importation of meat preparations apply to imports from a third country, and make transitional provision for the conditions which are to apply to the importation of meat preparations from territories which are to be subject to special transitional import arrangements.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

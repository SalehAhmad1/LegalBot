Section 53(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) provides that an education authority must provide or secure the provision of a school lunch (as defined in section 53(12) of the 1980 Act) free of charge to pupils falling within section 53(7).
Section 53(7)(aa) provides that a pupil falls within section 53(7) if the parents of the pupil are in receipt of an award of child tax credit and working tax credit where the income as calculated for the purpose of awarding those tax credits does not exceed £6,900. The effect is that pupils who fall within the prescribed description are entitled to be provided with a school lunch free of charge.

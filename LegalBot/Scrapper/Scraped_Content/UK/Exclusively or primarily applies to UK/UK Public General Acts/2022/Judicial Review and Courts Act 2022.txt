(e)

any other matter that appears to the court to be relevant.

(a)
before subsection (1) insert—
“(A1)
In cases arising under the law of England and Wales, section 29A of the Senior Courts Act 1981 applies in relation to a quashing order under section 15(1)(c) of this Act as it applies in relation to a quashing order under section 29 of that Act.”;
(b)
in subsection (2)(b), for “decision is quashed” substitute “quashing order is made”.

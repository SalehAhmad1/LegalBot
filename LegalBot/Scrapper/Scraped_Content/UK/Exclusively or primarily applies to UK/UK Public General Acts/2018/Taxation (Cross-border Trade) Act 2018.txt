When liability to import duty incurred
(1)
If—
(a)
chargeable goods are declared for the free-circulation procedure, and
(b)
HMRC accept the declaration,
a liability to import duty is incurred at the time of the acceptance.
(2)
If chargeable goods are declared for—
(a)
a storage procedure,
(b)
a transit procedure, or
(c)
an inward processing procedure,
the general rule is that a liability to import duty is not incurred by reference to the importation of the goods.
(3)
This rule is subject to the following two exceptions—
(a)
if there is no entitlement to make the Customs declaration concerned, a liability to import duty is incurred at the time the (purported) declaration is made, and
(b)
if there is a breach by any person of any requirement relating to the procedure, a liability to import duty is incurred at the time at which the breach first occurs.
(4)
In the case of goods declared for an authorised use procedure or temporary admission procedure—
(a)
a liability to import duty is incurred at the time the declaration is accepted by HMRC,
(b)
if there is an entitlement to make the declaration for the procedure, the rate of import duty is lower than the normal rate (see section 19(4)),
(c)
if there is no such entitlement, the liability is at the normal rate, and
(d)
if there is a breach of a requirement relating to the procedure, a further liability to import duty arises at the time of the breach at the normal rate reduced to take account of the amount of any earlier liability.
(5)
In the case of goods declared for a temporary admission procedure, see also section 19(5).
(6)
In this section any reference to the breach of a requirement relating to a special Customs procedure is to—
(a)
a breach, occurring while the procedure has effect, of the terms of the declaration for the procedure or of any other requirement imposed in relation to the procedure by or under Schedule 2, or
(b)
a breach, occurring at any time after the declaration was made, of any other requirement imposed by an HMRC officer in relation to the goods for which the declaration was made.
(7)
In this section “the normal rate” means the rate that, at the time of the declaration or breach (as the case may be), would be applicable if section 19(4) were ignored.

Customs agents
(1)
A person (“the principal”) may appoint any other person (a “Customs agent”) to act on the principal's behalf for the purposes of this Part, and—
(a)
the agent may make Customs declarations in the name of the principal (and in that case the agent acts as a “direct agent”), or
(b)

(2)
The appointment of a person as a Customs agent, and the withdrawal of an appointment of a person as a Customs agent, must be disclosed to HMRC in accordance with regulations made by HMRC Commissioners.
(3)
The effect of an appointment of a person as a Customs agent is that anything done under, or otherwise for the purposes of, this Part by, or in relation to, the agent is regarded as done under, or otherwise for the purposes of, this Part by, or in relation to, the principal (and not by the agent).

(a)
the agent acts at time when the appointment has not been disclosed to HMRC as mentioned in subsection (2),
(b)
the agent acts at a time when the appointment of the person as a Customs agent has been withdrawn,
(c)
the agent otherwise purports to act on behalf of the principal when the agent has no authority to do so, or
(d)
a liability to import duty is incurred by reference to the importation of goods declared for a Customs procedure and the declaration was not made in accordance with regulations under paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 (simplified Customs declarations).
(7)
HMRC Commissioners may by regulations make further provision about Customs agents for the purposes of import duty.
(8)
Each of the following is an example of the kind of provision that may be made by the regulations—
(a)
provision requiring persons to be eligible for appointment as Customs agents only if an HMRC officer has approved the appointment, and
(b)
provision specifying the criteria for approving the appointment (including provision for the criteria to be specified in a public notice given by HMRC Commissioners).

Meaning of “importation of goods” into the United Kingdom
(1)
This section determines for the purposes of this Act when, and by whom, goods are imported into the United Kingdom.
(2)
Goods are imported when they are declared for a Customs procedure under Part 1 of TCTA 2018.
(3)
But—
(a)
in the case of goods declared under TCTA 2018 for a storage procedure, a transit procedure or an inward processing procedure, the goods are imported when a liability to import duty is, or on the relevant assumptions would be, incurred in respect of them under section 4 of that Act, and
(b)
in the case of goods which are liable to forfeiture as a result of section 5(1) of, or paragraph 1(5) or 3(4) of Schedule 1 to, that Act (goods not presented to Customs or Customs declaration not made), the goods are imported when they become liable to forfeiture as a result of those provisions.
(4)
Each person who is, or on the relevant assumptions would be, liable to import duty in respect of goods imported into the United Kingdom is a person who has imported the goods.
(5)
For the purposes of this section “the relevant assumptions” are—
(a)
an assumption that a liability to import duty at a nil rate is replaced by a liability to import duty at a higher rate, and
(b)
an assumption that no relief from import duty is available.
(6)
If two or more persons are regarded as importing goods, those persons are jointly and severally liable to any VAT that is payable on the importation.
(7)
The preceding provisions of this section are to be ignored in reading any reference to importation or to an importer in anything applied for the purposes of this Act by section 16(1) or (2).
(8)

EU law relating to VAT
(1)
Any EU regulation so far as applying in relation to value added tax, and any direct EU legislation so far as relevant to any such regulation, that form part of the law of the United Kingdom as a result of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 cease to have effect (but, in the case of the implementing VAT regulation, see also subsection (5)).
(2)
In the application of section 4(1) of that Act (saving for EU rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies and procedures) in relation to value added tax, the rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, remedies and procedures mentioned there are subject to any exclusions or other modifications made by regulations made by the Treasury by statutory instrument.
(3)
Further provision relevant to the law relating to value added tax is made by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018: see, for example, section 6 of that Act (interpretation of retained EU law).
(4)
One of the consequences of the provision made by that Act is that the principle of EU law preventing the abuse of the VAT system (see, for example, the cases of Halifax and Kittel) continues to be relevant, in accordance with that Act, for the purposes of the law relating to value added tax.
[F1(4A)
Accordingly, that principle may continue to be relied upon in determining any matter relating to value added tax (including in determining the effect of any provision made by or under an enactment).]
(5)
Where the principal VAT directive remains relevant for determining the meaning and effect of the law relating to value added tax, that directive is to be read for that purpose in the light of the provision made by the implementing VAT regulation but ignoring such of its provisions as are excluded by regulations made by the Treasury by statutory instrument.
(6)
No regulations may be made under this section on or after 1 April 2023.
(7)
A statutory instrument containing regulations under this section must be laid before the House of Commons, and, unless approved by that House before the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which the instrument is made, ceases to have effect at the end of that period.
(8)
The fact that a statutory instrument ceases to have effect as mentioned in subsection (7) does not affect—
(a)
anything previously done under the instrument, or
(b)
the making of a new statutory instrument.
(9)
In calculating the period for the purposes of subsection (7), no account is to be taken of any time—
(a)
during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued, or
(b)
during which the House of Commons is adjourned for more than 4 days.
(10)
Regulations under this section—
(a)
may make different provision for different purposes or areas,
(b)
may contain supplementary, incidental and consequential provision, and
(c)
may contain transitional or transitory provision and savings.
(11)
In this section—
“the implementing VAT regulation” means Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011, and
“the principal VAT directive” means Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax.

Goods in relation to which that determination is made are referred to in this paragraph as relevant goods.
(3)
The TRA may recommend to the Secretary of State—
(a)
in the case of a dumping investigation that, in respect of all the relevant goods, all importers of those goods should be required to give a guarantee in respect of any additional amount of import duty which would have been applicable, or potentially applicable, to the goods under section 13 if an anti-dumping amount had been applied to the goods based on the provisional affirmative determination (“an estimated anti-dumping amount”), or
(b)
in the case of a subsidisation investigation that, in respect of all the relevant goods, all importers of those goods should be required to give a guarantee in respect of any additional amount of import duty which would have been applicable, or potentially applicable, to the goods under section 13 if a countervailing amount had been applied to the goods based on the provisional affirmative determination (“an estimated countervailing amount”).

TRA's recommendations about an anti-dumping amount or a countervailing amount
18
(1)
This paragraph applies to a recommendation by the TRA under paragraph 17(3) or (4) in relation to goods.
(2)
The specified period referred to in paragraph 17(3)(a) or (4)(a)—
(a)
must be a period of 5 years unless the TRA considers that a lesser period is sufficient to counteract—
(i)
the dumping of the goods which has caused or is causing injury to a UK industry in the goods, or
(ii)
the importation of the subsidised goods which has caused or is causing injury to a UK industry in the goods, and
(b)
if the recommendation is accepted by the Secretary of State, must begin on the day after the date of publication of the public notice under section 13 giving effect to the recommendation (see paragraph 20(5)(c)) unless the TRA is authorised by regulations under paragraph 19 to recommend a date before then.
(3)
In the case of a recommendation of such a prior date made by virtue of paragraph 19, the reference in sub-paragraph (2)(a) to a period of 5 years is to be read as a reference to a period of 5 years plus the relevant period (within the meaning of paragraph 19).
(4)
See also paragraph 21 regarding the possibility, following a review, of extensions or variations to the period for which an anti-dumping amount or a countervailing amount applies to goods.
(5)
The recommendation referred to in paragraph 17(3)(b) or (4)(b) as to how an anti-dumping amount or a countervailing amount applicable to goods should be determined may be by reference to either or both of the following—
(a)
the value of the goods, and
(b)
the weight or volume of the goods or any other measure of their quantity or size.
(6)
But that recommendation must be such that an anti-dumping amount or a countervailing amount applicable to goods does not exceed—
(a)
the margin of dumping or, as the case may be, the amount of the subsidy, in relation to the goods, or
(b)
the amount which the TRA is satisfied would be adequate to remove the injury to a UK industry in the goods if that amount is less than the margin of dumping or, as the case may be, the amount of the subsidy referred to in paragraph (a).
(7)
Regulations may make provision for the purposes of sub-paragraph (6)(b) about how the amount which the TRA is satisfied would be adequate to remove the injury described in that provision is to be determined.
(8)
A recommendation under paragraph 17(3) or (4) must include such other content as regulations may require.
[F9(9)
This paragraph has effect in relation to an option given by the TRA under paragraph 17(8A) as it has effect in relation to a recommendation by the TRA under paragraph 17(3) or (4).]

Definitive remedies: definitive safeguarding amount & tariff rate quotas
TRA's duty to recommend a definitive safeguarding amount or tariff rate quota
16
(1)
This paragraph applies where the TRA makes a final affirmative determination in relation to goods which are the subject of a safeguarding investigation.
(2)
Goods in relation to which that determination is made are referred to in this paragraph as relevant goods.
(3)
The TRA may recommend to the Secretary of State—
(a)
that an additional amount of import duty (referred to in this Schedule as a “definitive safeguarding amount”) should be applicable for a specified period to all the relevant goods or to specified relevant goods;
(b)
that all the relevant goods, or specified relevant goods, should be subject to a quota for a specified period during which a lower rate of import duty should be applicable to imports of goods within the amount of the quota than is applicable to imports of goods outside the amount of the quota (referred to in this Schedule as a “tariff rate quota”).
(4)
Where the TRA makes a recommendation under sub-paragraph (3)(a) in relation to relevant goods it must, as part of the recommendation, recommend to the Secretary of State how a definitive safeguarding amount applicable to those goods should be determined.
(5)
The TRA may make a recommendation under sub-paragraph (3) only if it is satisfied that—
F1(a)
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
(b)
there is in place an adjustment plan setting out how UK producers of the relevant goods intend to adjust to the importation of the goods in increased quantities.
(6)
But sub-paragraph (5) is to be read as if paragraph (b) were omitted if the TRA waived the requirement for the application to initiate a safeguarding investigation in relation to the relevant goods to be accompanied by a preliminary adjustment plan.
(7)
Regulations may make provision about the form and content of an adjustment plan.
(8)
The TRA may only make a recommendation under one or other of paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-paragraph (3) in relation to any particular relevant good.
(9)
The TRA may make a recommendation under paragraph (a) or (b) of sub-paragraph (3) in relation to specified relevant goods (rather than all the relevant goods) only if the recommendations which it makes under that sub-paragraph, when taken together, cover all the relevant goods.
(10)
If the TRA determines that there are one or more recommendations which it could make under sub-paragraph (3) in relation to all the relevant goods, or that there are one or more recommendations which it could make under sub-paragraph (3) in relation to specified relevant goods, it must make that recommendation or one of those recommendations (subject to sub-paragraphs (8) and (9)).
[F2(10A)
Where the TRA considers that there are two or more options which it could recommend under sub-paragraph (3)(a) or (b), in relation to relevant goods or descriptions of relevant goods, it may give the Secretary of State each of those options as part of its recommendation.
(10B)
The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision requiring the TRA, in specified circumstances, to consider whether it could give the Secretary of State two or more options as part of its recommendation under sub-paragraph (3)(a) or (b) in relation to relevant goods or descriptions of relevant goods.
(10C)
Where, after considering whether it could give the Secretary of State two or more options as part of its recommendation in accordance with regulations under sub-paragraph (10B), the TRA considers that there is only one option which it could reasonably recommend under sub-paragraph (3)(a) or (b) in relation to relevant goods or descriptions of relevant goods, it must give the Secretary of State its reasons for reaching that conclusion.
(10D)
Where the TRA gives the Secretary of State options, it must—
(a)
give the Secretary of State its reasons for including each option, and
(b)
inform the Secretary of State which option it prefers and why.
(10E)
Where the TRA makes a recommendation under sub-paragraph (3) it must advise the Secretary of State whether and why it considers that applying a definitive safeguarding amount or making relevant goods subject to a quota in accordance with—
(a)
its recommendation, or
(b)
where the recommendation contains options given under sub-paragraph (10A), each option,
would meet the economic interest test (see paragraph 23).]
(11)
If the TRA determines that there is no recommendation which it could make under sub-paragraph (3) it must—
(a)
publish notice of its final affirmative determination in relation to the goods,
(b)
publish notice of its determination that there is no recommendation which it could make under sub-paragraph (3), and
(c)
notify the Secretary of State and interested parties (see paragraph 31(3)) accordingly.

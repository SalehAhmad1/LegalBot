(b)
an injury of soft tissue associated with a muscle, tendon or ligament in the neck, back or shoulder.
(3)
An injury is excepted by this subsection if—
(a)
it is an injury of soft tissue which is a part of or connected to another injury, and
(b)
the other injury is not an injury of soft tissue in the neck, back or shoulder of a description falling within subsection (2).
(4)
For the purposes of this Part a person suffers a whiplash injury because of driver negligence if—

(c)
the negligence of the other person or persons consists in an act or acts done by the person or persons while using a motor vehicle on a road or other public place in England or Wales.
(5)
The fact that the act or acts constituting the negligence of the other person or persons is or are also sufficient to establish another cause of action does not prevent subsection (4)(b) being satisfied.

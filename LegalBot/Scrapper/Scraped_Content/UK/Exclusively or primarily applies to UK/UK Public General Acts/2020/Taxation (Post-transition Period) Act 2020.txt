“SCHEDULE 9ZA
VAT on acquisitions in Northern Ireland from member States
PART 1
Charge to VAT for acquisitions in Northern Ireland from member States
Charge to VAT
1
(1)
VAT is charged, in accordance with this Schedule, on the acquisition in Northern Ireland of goods from a member State—
(a)
by reference to the value of the acquisition as determined under Part 2 of this Schedule, and
(b)
subject to paragraph 16, at the rate of VAT for the time being in force under section 2.
(2)
VAT charged on the acquisition of goods in Northern Ireland from a member State is a liability of the person who acquires the goods and (subject to provisions about accounting and payment) becomes due at the time of acquisition.
(3)
VAT charged on the acquisition of goods in Northern Ireland from a member State in accordance with this Schedule is referred to in this Schedule as “NI acquisition VAT”.
(4)
References to VAT (without more) in this Act include NI acquisition VAT.
(5)
The Commissioners may by regulations make provision about (including provision modifying) the application of provision that applies to value added tax made by or under any enactment (including provision made by or under this Act) to NI acquisition VAT or to goods acquired in Northern Ireland from a member State.
Scope of NI acquisition VAT
2
(1)
NI acquisition VAT is charged on any acquisition from a member State of any goods where—
(a)
the acquisition is a taxable acquisition,
(b)
it takes place in Northern Ireland,
(c)
it is not in pursuance of a taxable supply (see section 4(2)), and
(d)
the person who makes it is a taxable person or the goods acquired are subject to a duty of excise or consist in a new means of transport.
(2)
In this Act, a “taxable acquisition” means an acquisition of goods from a member State that—
(a)
is not an exempt acquisition (see paragraph 17(5)), and
(b)
falls within sub-paragraph (3) or is an acquisition of goods consisting in a new means of transport.
(3)
An acquisition of goods from a member State falls within this sub-paragraph if—
(a)
the goods are acquired in the course or furtherance of—
(i)
any business carried on by any person, or
(ii)
any activities carried on otherwise than by way of business by any body corporate or by any club, association, organisation or other unincorporated body,
(b)
it is the person who carries on that business or those activities who acquires the goods, and
(c)
the supplier—
(i)
is taxable in a member State at the time of the transaction in pursuance of which the goods are acquired, and
(ii)
in participating in that transaction, acts in the course or furtherance of a business carried on by the supplier.
Meaning of acquisition of goods from a member State
3
(1)
References in this Act to the acquisition of goods from a member State are to an acquisition of goods in pursuance of a transaction that—
(a)
is a supply of goods (including anything treated for the purposes of this Act as a supply of goods), and
(b)
involves the removal of the goods from a member State (whether by or under the direction of the supplier, the person who acquires the goods or any other person),
and references in this Act, in relation to such an acquisition, to the supplier are to be construed accordingly.
(2)
Where the person with the property in any goods does not change in consequence of anything which is treated for the purposes of this Act as a supply of goods, that supply is to be treated for the purposes of this Act as a transaction in pursuance of which there is an acquisition by the person making the supply.
(3)
The Treasury may by regulations make provision about the circumstances in which an acquisition of goods is not to be treated as an acquisition of goods from a member State.
Time of acquisition
4
(1)
For the purposes of this Act, the normal rule for determining the time that goods were acquired from a member State is that they are treated as being acquired on the earlier of—
(a)
the 15th day of the month after the month in which the first removal of the goods occurs, and
(b)
the day a relevant invoice is issued in respect of the transaction in pursuance of which the goods were acquired.
(2)
But—
(a)
different rules apply to acquisitions to which Part 4 of Schedule 9ZB applies (warehouses), and
(b)
the Commissioners may by regulations provide for different rules to apply in any case described in those regulations.
(3)
Regulations under sub-paragraph (2)(b) may include provision treating an acquisition as a series of acquisitions taking place at different times.
(4)
In sub-paragraph (1) “relevant invoice” means an invoice of a description prescribed by regulations made by the Commissioners.
(5)
For the purposes of this Act “first removal”, in relation to goods acquired, means the first removal of the goods in the course of the transaction in pursuance of which they are acquired.
Place of acquisition
5
(1)
For the purposes of this Act, the normal rule for determining whether goods are acquired in Northern Ireland is that they are treated as being acquired in Northern Ireland if—
(a)
they are acquired in pursuance of a transaction which involves their removal from a member State to Northern Ireland and which does not involve their removal from Northern Ireland, or
(b)
they are acquired by a person who, for the purposes of their acquisition, makes use of a number assigned to the person for the purposes of VAT in the United Kingdom along with an NI VAT identifier (see paragraph 7).
(2)
But—
(a)
goods are not treated as being acquired in Northern Ireland by virtue of sub-paragraph (1)(b) where it is established in accordance with regulations made by the Commissioners that VAT—
(i)
has been paid in a member State on the acquisition of those goods, and
(ii)
fell to be paid by virtue of provisions of the law of that member State corresponding, in relation to that member State, to the provision made by sub-paragraph (1)(a), and
(b)
different rules apply to acquisitions to which paragraph 16 or 17 of Schedule 9ZB applies.
(3)
If an acquisition of goods is not treated, for the purposes of this Act, as taking place in Northern Ireland it is treated for those purposes as an acquisition taking place outside Northern Ireland.
(4)
The Commissioners may by regulations make provision—
(a)
about the circumstances in which a person is to be treated as having made use of a number assigned to the person for the purposes of VAT in the United Kingdom along with an NI VAT identifier for the purposes of the acquisition of any goods, and
(b)
for the refund, in prescribed circumstances, of NI acquisition VAT paid on acquisitions of goods in relation to which the conditions in sub-paragraph (2)(a)(i) and (ii) are met.
Acquisitions from persons belonging in member States
6
(1)
Sub-paragraph (2) applies where—
(a)
a person (“the original supplier”) makes a supply of goods to a person who belongs in a member State (“the intermediate supplier”),
(b)
that supply involves the removal of the goods from a member State and their removal to Northern Ireland but does not involve the removal of the goods from Northern Ireland,
(c)
both that supply and the removal of the goods to Northern Ireland are for the purposes of the making of a supply by the intermediate supplier to another person (“the customer”) who is registered under this Act,
(d)
neither of those supplies involves the removal of the goods from a member State in which the intermediate supplier is taxable at the time of the removal without also involving the previous removal of the goods to that member State, and
(e)
there would be a taxable acquisition by the customer if the supply to the customer involved the removal of goods from a member State to Northern Ireland.
(2)
Where this sub-paragraph applies—
(a)
the supply by the original supplier to the intermediate supplier is ignored for the purposes of this Act, and
(b)
the supply by the intermediate supplier to the customer is treated for the purposes of this Act, other than for the purposes of Part 8 of this Schedule, as if it did involve the removal of the goods from a member State to Northern Ireland.
(3)
For the purposes of this Act, other than for the purposes of Part 8 of this Schedule, a supply of goods is treated as involving their removal from a member State to Northern Ireland, and is treated as not being a taxable supply if—
(a)
the supply is made by a person belonging in a member State to a person who is registered under this Act,
(b)
the supply involves the installation or assembly of the goods at a place in Northern Ireland to which they are removed, and
(c)
were the supply to be treated as described in the words before paragraph (a), there would be a taxable acquisition by the registered person.
(4)
But neither sub-paragraph (2) nor sub-paragraph (3) applies in relation to a supply unless—
(a)
in the case of sub-paragraph (2), the intermediate supplier, or
(b)
in the case of sub-paragraph (3), the person making the supply,
complies with such requirements to provide information to the Commissioners or to the person supplied as may be specified in regulations made by the Commissioners.
(5)
The requirements to provide information that may be specified in regulations include—
(a)
requirements to provide documents (for example, invoices);
(b)
requirements to provide information or documents before a supply is made (as well as after);
(c)
requirements as to the content and form of information or documents to be provided;
(d)
requirements as to the manner in which information or documents are to be provided.
(6)
Where a taxable acquisition is treated as having been made by virtue of this paragraph, that acquisition is treated as taking place at the time referred to in paragraph 4(1)(b) (day on which invoice issued).
(7)
For the purposes of this paragraph a person belongs in a member State if—
(a)
the person is taxable in a member State,
(b)
the person does not have any business establishment or other fixed establishment in Northern Ireland,
(c)
the person's usual place of residence is not in Northern Ireland,
(d)
the person is not identified for the purposes of VAT in Northern Ireland and is not required, as a result of regulations under paragraph 7, to make a request to be so identified, and
(e)
the person does not have a VAT representative who is identified for the purposes of VAT in Northern Ireland in connection with acting on the person's behalf, and is not for the time being required to appoint one who would be identified for those purposes.
(8)
In determining, for the purposes of sub-paragraph (7)(d), whether a person is required to be registered under this Act, ignore any supplies made by the person that would be ignored for the purposes of this Act if the person belonged in a member State and complied with the information requirements that would apply by virtue of sub-paragraph (4).
(9)
Where—
(a)
any goods are acquired from a member State in a case which corresponds, in relation to another member State, to the case described in sub-paragraph (1) in relation to Northern Ireland, and
(b)
the person who acquires the goods is registered under this Act, is identified for the purposes of VAT in Northern Ireland and would be the intermediate supplier in relation to that corresponding case,
the supply to that person of those goods and the supply by that person of those goods to the person who would be the customer in that corresponding case are to be ignored for the purposes of this Act.
(10)
References in this paragraph to a person being taxable in a member State do not include references to a person who is so taxable by virtue only of provisions of the law of that member State corresponding to the provisions of this Act by virtue of which a person who is not registered under this Act is a taxable person if the person is required to be so registered.
Identification of persons for the purposes of VAT in Northern Ireland
7
(1)

(2)
In this Act “identified for the purposes of VAT in Northern Ireland” means identified in accordance with regulations under this paragraph.
(3)

(a)
the person is registered under this Act, or

(a)
about the circumstances in which a person may request to be identified for the purposes of VAT in Northern Ireland;

(c)
about the circumstances in which the Commissioners may determine that a person is identified for the purposes of VAT in Northern Ireland otherwise than at the person's request;

PART 2
Valuation of acquisitions
Valuation of acquisitions from member States
8
(1)
For the purposes of this Act the value of any acquisition of goods from a member State is taken to be the value of the transaction in pursuance of which they are acquired.
(2)
Where goods are acquired from a member State otherwise than in pursuance of a taxable supply, the value of the transaction in pursuance of which they are acquired is to be determined for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) in accordance with this Part, and for those purposes—
(a)
sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) have effect subject to paragraphs 9 to 13, and
(b)
section 19 and Schedule 6 do not apply in relation to the transaction.
(3)
If the transaction is for a consideration in money, its value is taken to be such amount as is equal to the consideration.
(4)
If the transaction is for a consideration not consisting or not wholly consisting of money, its value is taken to be such amount in money as is equivalent to the consideration.
(5)
Where a transaction in pursuance of which goods are acquired from a member State is not the only matter to which a consideration in money relates, the transaction is deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it.
Transactions below market value
9
(1)
Where, in the case of the acquisition of any goods from a member State—
(a)
the relevant transaction (see paragraph 13) is for a consideration in money,
(b)
the value of the relevant transaction is (apart from this paragraph) less than the transaction⿿s open market value,
(c)
the supplier and the person who acquires the goods are connected, and
(d)
that person is not entitled under sections 25 and 26 to credit for all the VAT on the acquisition,
the Commissioners may direct that the value of the relevant transaction is taken to be its open market value.
(2)
A direction under this paragraph must be given—
(a)
by notice in writing to the person by whom the acquisition in question is made, and
(b)
within the period of 3 years commencing with the relevant time (see paragraph 13).

A direction given to a person under this paragraph in respect of a transaction may include a direction that the value of any transaction—
(a)
in pursuance of which goods are acquired by the person from a member State after the giving of the notice, or after such later date as may be specified in the notice, and
(b)
as to which the conditions in paragraphs (a) to (d) of sub-paragraph (1) are satisfied,
is be taken to be its open market value.
(4)
For the purposes of this paragraph, the open market value of a transaction in pursuance of which goods are acquired from a member State is to be taken to be the amount which would fall to be taken as its value under paragraph 8(3) if it were for such consideration in money as would be payable by a person standing in no such relationship with any person as would affect that consideration.
(5)
Section 1122 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (“connected” persons) applies for the purpose of determining whether a person is connected with another for the purposes of this paragraph.

(1)
This paragraph applies, in such cases as the Commissioners may by regulations prescribe, to an acquisition—

that is not an acquisition that is treated, by virtue of paragraph 16(7) of Schedule 9ZB, as taking place before the time which is the duty point (within the meaning given by paragraph 16(11) of that Schedule).
(2)
The value of the relevant transaction in relation to an acquisition to which this paragraph applies is the sum of the value of that transaction (apart from this paragraph) and the total amount of relevant duty charged that is not already reflected in the value of that transaction.
(3)
In this paragraph “relevant duty” in relation to an acquisition means—
(a)
a duty of excise charged in connection with the removal of goods to Northern Ireland;
(b)
any EU customs duty or agricultural levy of the European Union charged on that removal in accordance with any provision for the time being having effect for transitional purposes in connection with the accession of any State to the European Union.
Transfer or disposal for no consideration
11
(1)
Where goods are acquired from a member State in pursuance of anything which is treated as a supply for the purposes of this Act as a result of paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 4 or paragraph 30 of Schedule 9ZB and there is no consideration, sub-paragraph (3) applies for determining the value of the relevant transaction.
(2)
Sub-paragraph (3) also applies for determining the value of the relevant transaction in the case of an acquisition by a supplier that is deemed to take place as a result of paragraph 60(2)(c) or 61(2)(c).
(3)
The value of the relevant transaction is taken to be—
(a)
such consideration in money as would be payable by the supplier if the supplier were, at the time of the acquisition, to purchase goods identical in every respect (including age and condition) to the goods concerned,
(b)
where the value cannot be ascertained in accordance with paragraph (a), such consideration in money as would be payable by the supplier if the supplier were, at that time, to purchase goods similar to, and of the same age and condition as, the goods concerned, or
(c)
where the value cannot be ascertained in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b), the cost of producing the goods concerned if they were produced at that time.
(4)
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3), the amount of consideration in money that would be payable by any person if the person were to purchase any goods is taken to be the amount that would be so payable after the deduction of any amount included in the purchase price in respect of VAT on the supply of the goods to that person.
Foreign currency transactions
12
(1)
Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, where—
(a)
goods are acquired from a member State, and
(b)
any sum relevant for determining the value of the relevant transaction is expressed in a currency other than sterling,
then, for the purpose of valuing the relevant transaction, that sum is to be converted into sterling at the market rate which, on the relevant day, would apply in the United Kingdom to a purchase with sterling of that sum in the currency in question by the person making the acquisition.
(2)
Where the Commissioners have published a notice which, for the purposes of this paragraph, specifies—
(a)
rates of exchange, or
(b)
methods of determining rates of exchange,
a rate specified in or determined in accordance with the notice, as for the time being in force, applies (instead of the rate for which sub-paragraph (1) provides) in the case of any transaction in pursuance of which goods are acquired by a person who opts, in such manner as may be allowed by the Commissioners, for the use of that rate in relation to that transaction.
(3)
An option for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2) for the use of a particular rate or method of determining a rate—
(a)
may not be exercised by any person except in relation to all such transactions in pursuance of which goods are acquired by the person from a member State as are of a particular description or after a particular date, and
(b)
may not be withdrawn or varied except with the consent of the Commissioners and in such manner as they may require.
(4)
In specifying a method of determining a rate of exchange, a notice published by the Commissioners under sub-paragraph (2) may allow a person to apply to the Commissioners for the use, for the purpose of valuing some or all of the transactions in pursuance of which goods are acquired by the person from a member State, of a rate of exchange which is different from any which would otherwise apply.
(5)
On an application made in accordance with provision contained in a notice under sub-paragraph (4), the Commissioners may authorise the use with respect to the applicant of such a rate of exchange, in such circumstances, in relation to such transactions and subject to such conditions as they think fit.
(6)
A notice published by the Commissioners for the purposes of this paragraph may be withdrawn or varied by a subsequent notice published by the Commissioners.
(7)
Where goods are acquired from a member State, the appropriate rate of exchange is to be determined for the purpose of valuing the relevant transaction by reference to the relevant time; and, accordingly, the day on which that time falls is the relevant day for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1).

PART 1
Importations
Importations
1
(1)
The importation of Union goods into the United Kingdom as a result of their entry into Northern Ireland is not an importation for the purposes of value added tax.
(2)
Accordingly, no charge to VAT occurs on the importation of Union goods into the United Kingdom as a result of their entry into Northern Ireland (but see paragraph 1 of Schedule 9ZA, which imposes a charge to VAT on the acquisition of goods in Northern Ireland from a member State).
(3)
VAT on the importation of any other goods imported into the United Kingdom as a result of their entry into Northern Ireland is to be charged and payable as if it were relevant NI import duty (instead of as provided under section 1(4)).
(4)
Sub-paragraph (3) is to be taken as applying, in relation to any VAT chargeable on the importation of such goods—
(a)
any provision of Union customs legislation that is relevant to the charging of relevant NI import duty, and
(b)
any provision made by or under Part 1 of TCTA 2018 that is relevant to the charging of that duty.
(5)
Section 15 (meaning of “importation of goods” into the United Kingdom) applies to the importation of such goods as if—
(a)
any reference to import duty were to relevant NI import duty;
(b)
the references in subsections (2) and (3) to a Customs, storage, transit or inward processing procedure were to a procedure corresponding to such a procedure under Union customs legislation, and
(c)
the reference in subsection (3)(b) to section 5(1) of, or paragraph 1(5) or 3(4) of Schedule 1 to, that Act included any provision (including any provision of Union customs legislation) corresponding to those provisions that may apply to those goods.
(6)
In section 16 (application of customs enactments)—
(a)
subsection (1) applies to the importation of such goods as if the reference to “other enactments for the time being having effect generally in relation to duties of customs and excise charged by reference to the importation of goods into the United Kingdom” included any provision of Union customs legislation that applies in relation to relevant NI import duty, and
(b)
subsections (3) and (4) apply to sub-paragraph (4) of this paragraph as they apply to subsection (2) of that section.
(7)
The Commissioners may by regulations—
(a)
supplement or modify any provision made by provision that applies to value added tax made by or under any enactment (including provision made by or under this Act or TCTA 2018) so far as it applies to VAT charged on the importation of goods into the United Kingdom as a result of their entry into Northern Ireland;
(b)
supplement or modify any provision of Union customs legislation so far as it applies to VAT charged on such an importation.
(8)
In this Schedule—
“relevant NI import duty” means duty charged under section 30A(3) of TCTA 2018 (importation of goods: Northern Ireland), and in relation to goods of a description specified in regulations under section 30B(1) of that Act, means that duty as it would be charged if that description were not specified;
“Union customs legislation” means provisions contained in “customs legislation” within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code (see Article 5(2) of that Regulation), so far as they apply by virtue of section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018);
“Union goods” has the meaning it has in that Regulation.
Valuation of imports

(1)
For the purposes of this Act, the value of goods imported into the United Kingdom as a result of their entry into Northern Ireland is their value as if determined for the purposes of relevant NI import duty, whether or not the goods are subject to that duty.
(2)
Accordingly, section 21(1) (value of imported goods) does not apply in relation to such goods.
(3)
Subsections (2) to (7) of section 21 apply in relation to such goods (and sub-paragraph (1) is subject to those subsections) as if—
(a)
the reference in subsection (2) to the rules mentioned in subsection (1) of that section were to the rules mentioned in sub-paragraph (1);
(b)
in subsection (2)(c), after “United Kingdom” there were inserted “ or a member State ”;

that is relevant to the charging of VAT on the importation of goods applies in relation to VAT charged as a result of sub-paragraph (2);

that applies to an importation of goods for the purpose of value added tax applies to such a removal (and references in any such provision to imported goods are to be read as including goods that have been so removed).

(a)
that is relevant to the charging of VAT on the importation of goods applies (as modified by or under Part 1 of this Schedule) in relation to VAT charged as a result of sub-paragraph (4);
(b)
that applies to an importation of goods for the purposes of VAT applies (as modified by or under that Part) to such a removal (and references in this Act to imported goods are to be read as including goods that have been so removed).

Sub-paragraphs (3) and (5)—
(a)
do not apply so far as the context otherwise requires, and
(b)
are subject to the other provisions of this Part of this Schedule.

supplement or modify any provision of Union customs legislation so far as it applies to VAT charged as a result of sub-paragraph (4).
Liability for VAT on movements between Great Britain and Northern Ireland

(2)
Goods are treated as imported—
(a)
in the case of goods removed from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, when a liability to pay duty under section 30C of TCTA 2018 (duty on potentially imported goods) in respect of those goods is, or on the relevant assumptions would be, incurred, and
(b)
in the case of goods removed from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, when a liability to pay duty under section 40A of TCTA 2018 (duty on certain goods removed to Northern Ireland) in respect of those goods is, or on the relevant assumptions would be, incurred.
(3)
Where the removal is made in the course of a taxable supply made by a taxable person, the taxable person is the person who is treated as having imported the goods.
(4)
Otherwise, each person who—
(a)
in the case of goods removed from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, is, or on the relevant assumptions would be, liable to pay duty under section 30C of TCTA 2018 in respect of those goods, or
(b)
in the case of goods removed from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, is, or on the relevant assumptions would be, liable to pay duty under section 40A of TCTA 2018 in respect of those goods,
is a person who is treated as having imported the goods.
(5)
For the purposes of this paragraph “the relevant assumptions” are—
(a)
in the case of goods removed from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, an assumption that duty under section 30C of TCTA 2018 is chargeable in respect of those goods,
(b)
in the case of goods removed from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, an assumption that duty under section 40A of TCTA 2018 is chargeable in respect of those goods,
(c)
in a case where there is no obligation to present the goods to customs on their arrival in the part of the United Kingdom to which they are removed, an assumption that there is such an obligation,
(d)
an assumption that a liability to duty at a nil rate is replaced by a liability to duty at a higher rate, and
(e)
an assumption that no relief from duty is available.
(6)
The Commissioners may by regulations make provision—
(a)
for any other person to be treated as importing the goods (instead of, or as well as, any person treated as importing the goods as a result of sub-paragraph (3) or (4));
(b)
about (including provision modifying) the application, in relation to such a person, of any provision made by or under any enactment that has effect for the purposes of, or in connection with the enforcement of, any obligation to account for and pay VAT;
(c)
for requiring any relevant person liable to VAT as a result of provision made by or under this paragraph to give to the Commissioners such notification of the removal of goods in question, and for such VAT to be paid, in such form or manner as may be specified in the regulations or by the Commissioners in accordance with the regulations.
(7)
A person is “relevant” for the purposes of sub-paragraph (6)(c) if the person was not a taxable person at the time they became liable to the VAT in question.
(8)
If two or more persons are treated as having imported goods those persons are jointly and severally liable to any VAT that is payable on the removal that is treated as an importation as a result of paragraph 3.
(9)
The preceding provisions of this paragraph, and any provision made under sub-paragraph (6)(a), are to be ignored in reading any reference to importation or to an importer in anything applied for the purposes of this Act by section 16(1) or (2).
(10)
But sub-paragraph (9) does not apply so far as the context otherwise requires or provision to the contrary is contained in regulations under section 16(3).
Valuation of goods removed from Northern Ireland to Great Britain
5
(1)
This paragraph applies where goods are removed from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and—
(a)
the removal is in the course of a supply, or
(b)
the last supply of those goods before their removal is zero-rated as a result of that removal.
(2)
Where this paragraph applies—
(a)
section 21 (value of imported goods) does not apply for the purpose of determining the value of those goods, and
(b)
the value of those goods is to be treated as—
(i)
in a case falling within sub-paragraph (1)(a), the value of the supply in accordance with section 19 and Schedule 6 (value of supply of goods), and
(ii)
in a case falling within sub-paragraph (1)(b), the value of the last supply of those goods before their removal as determined in accordance with that section and that Schedule.
Relief for qualifying Northern Ireland goods
6
(1)
No VAT is to be charged on the removal of qualifying Northern Ireland goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain as a result of paragraph 3(2) unless the removal is made in the course of a taxable supply made by a taxable person.
(2)
But the relief provided by sub-paragraph (1) does not apply to a removal of qualifying goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain if the last supply of those goods before their removal is zero-rated as a result of that removal.
(3)
Any VAT that is chargeable as a result of sub-paragraph (2) becomes chargeable from the later of—
(a)
the time when the goods were treated as having been imported as a result of the removal, and
(b)
the time at which that last supply becomes zero-rated.
(4)
In this paragraph “qualifying Northern Ireland goods” has the meaning it has in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (see section 8C(6) of that Act).
Zero-rating of supplies made before declaration on removal
7
Item 1 of Group 13 of Schedule 8 (zero-rating)—
(a)
applies to a supply of goods which are removed from Great Britain to Northern Ireland as if the reference to a Customs declaration were to such a declaration made for the purposes of Union customs legislation (rather than under Part 1 of TCTA 2018);
(b)
does not apply to goods which are removed from Northern Ireland to Great Britain where no Customs declaration under Part 1 of TCTA 2018 is required to be made in respect of the removal of the goods.

their acquisition in a member State by a person who is liable for VAT on the acquisition in accordance with provisions of the law of that member State corresponding, in relation to that member State, to the provisions of paragraph 2,
subsections (2), (4) to (6) and (10) to (12) of section 6 (time of supply) do not apply and the supply is treated for the purposes of this Act as taking place on whichever is the earlier of the days specified in sub-paragraph (2).
(2)
The days mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) are—
(a)
the 15th day of the month following that in which the removal in question takes place, and
(b)
the day of the issue, in respect of the supply, of a VAT invoice or of an invoice of such other description as the Commissioners may by regulations prescribe.

(1)
Goods whose place of supply is not determined under subsection (2) or (3) of section 7 (place of supply of goods) are treated as supplied in the United Kingdom where—

the supply involves the removal of the goods to Northern Ireland by or under the directions of the person who supplies them,
(b)
the supply is a transaction in pursuance of which the goods are acquired in Northern Ireland from a member State by a person who is not a taxable person,
(c)
the supplier—
(i)
is liable to be registered under Part 9 of Schedule 9ZA, or
(ii)
would be so liable if the supplier were not already registered under this Act or liable to be registered under Schedule 1 or 1A, and
(d)
the supply is neither a supply of goods consisting in a new means of transport nor anything which is treated as a supply for the purposes of this Act by virtue only of paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 4 or paragraph 30 of Schedule 9ZB.
(2)
Goods whose place of supply is not determined under sub-paragraph (1) or subsection (2) or (3) of section 7 and which do not consist in a new means of transport are treated as supplied outside the United Kingdom where—

(b)
the person who makes the supply is taxable in a member State, and

But sub-paragraph (2) does not apply in relation to any supply in a case where the liability mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)(c) depends on the exercise by any person of an option in the United Kingdom corresponding to such an option as is mentioned in paragraph 48(2) unless that person has given, and has not withdrawn, a notification to the Commissioners that the person wishes supplies by that person to be treated as taking place outside the United kingdom where they are supplies in relation to which the other requirements of sub-paragraph (2) are satisfied.
(4)
The Commissioners may by regulations provide that a notification for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) is not to be given or withdrawn except in such circumstances, and in such form and manner, as may be prescribed.
(5)
For the purposes of this paragraph—
(a)
where goods, in the course of their removal from a place in Northern Ireland to another place in Northern Ireland leave and re-enter Northern Ireland the removal is not to be treated as a removal from or to Northern Ireland, and
(b)
where goods, in the course of their removal from a place in Northern Ireland to another place in the United Kingdom leave and re-enter the United Kingdom the removal is not to be treated as a removal from Northern Ireland.

(2)
Conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (1) may—
(a)
be so imposed wholly or partly by reference to, or without reference to, any conditions prescribed for the purposes of this paragraph, and

(3)
For the purposes of this paragraph a person ceases to be registrable under this Act where—
(a)
the person ceases to be a person who would be liable or entitled to be registered under this Act if the person's registration and any enactment preventing a person from being liable to be registered under different provisions at the same time were disregarded, or
(b)
in the case of a person who (having been registered under paragraph 9(1)) has not been such a person during the period of the person's registration, the person ceases to have any intention of making or facilitating relevant supplies.
Cancellation of registration
11

Where a person registered under this Schedule satisfies the Commissioners that the person is not liable to be so registered, the Commissioners must, if the person so requests, cancel that registration with effect from the day on which the request is made or from such later date as may be agreed between the Commissioners and the person.
(2)

(3)
Where the Commissioners are satisfied that a person who has been registered under paragraph 9(1) and is not for the time being liable to be registered under this Schedule—
(a)
has not begun, by the date specified in the person's request to be registered, to make or facilitate relevant supplies, or

the Commissioners may cancel the person's registration with effect from the date so specified or, as the case may be, the date of the contravention or from such later date as may be agreed between the Commissioners and the person.
(4)
But the Commissioners may not, under sub-paragraph (1), (2) or (3), cancel a person⿿s registration with effect from any time unless the Commissioners are satisfied that it is not a time when that person would be subject to a requirement, or in a case falling under sub-paragraph (2) or (3) a requirement or entitlement, to be registered under this Act.
(5)
Where the Commissioners are satisfied that, on the day on which a person was registered under this Schedule, the person—
(a)
was not registrable under this Schedule, and
(b)
in the case of a person registered under paragraph 9(1), did not have the intention by reference to which the person was registered,
the Commissioners may cancel that registration with effect from that day.
(6)
In determining, for the purposes of sub-paragraph (4), whether a person would be subject to a requirement, or would be entitled, to be registered at any time, so much of any provision of this Act as prevents a person from becoming liable or entitled to be registered when the person is already registered or when the person is so liable under any other provision is to be disregarded.
(7)
For the purposes of this paragraph, a person is registrable under this Schedule at any time when the person is liable to be registered under this Schedule or is a person who makes or facilitates relevant supplies.

Any notification required under this Part of this Schedule must be made in such form and manner and must contain such particulars as may be specified in regulations or by the Commissioners in accordance with regulations.

“SCHEDULE 7ZA
Recovery of unlawful state aid
Recovery of unlawful state aid
1
(1)
Any amount that would have been chargeable on a company as if it were corporation tax for a relevant accounting period of the company by virtue of this Part, if the company had not benefited from the unlawful state aid identified in the Commission Decision, is to be treated as chargeable on that company as if it were corporation tax for that relevant accounting period by virtue of this Part.
(2)
In this Schedule, such an amount is referred to as an “additional amount”.
Charging notice
2
(1)
This paragraph applies where an officer of HMRC has reason to believe that an additional amount is chargeable on a company in respect of one or more of the company's relevant accounting periods.
(2)
The officer may—
(a)
make an assessment of the additional amounts which ought in their opinion to be charged on the company for each relevant accounting period, and
(b)
give a notice (a “charging notice”) to that company requiring it to pay those amounts.
(3)
More than one charging notice may be given to a company in respect of a relevant accounting period.
(4)
A charging notice must—
(a)
state the relevant accounting periods to which the notice applies,
(b)
state the additional amounts required to be paid by the notice for each of those relevant accounting periods,
(c)
set out the basis on which the officer has calculated the additional amounts,
(d)
state the period within which payment must be made, and
(e)
explain how interest is to be calculated in accordance with paragraph 8.
(5)
Where a charging notice is given to a company, the company must pay the additional amounts specified in the notice within the period of 30 days beginning with the day on which the notice is given to the company.
(6)
The payment of the amounts specified in the notice may not be postponed on any grounds, and so the amounts charged by the charging notice remain due and payable despite any appeal in respect of the notice.
Charging period
3
(1)
No charging notice may be given after the end of the charging period.
(2)
The charging period is the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which Schedule 4 to the Taxation (Post-transition Period) Act 2020 comes into force.
(3)
The Treasury may by regulations amend sub-paragraph (2) so as to extend the charging period if they consider it necessary to do so in order to give effect to the Commission Decision.
(4)
The power in sub-paragraph (3) may be exercised more than once.
Consequential claims etc

(1)
An officer of HMRC may by notice (a “consequential amendment notice”) given to a company make any adjustment or amendment, in relation to the company, to any company tax return, self-assessment, discovery assessment, claim, election, application or notice (including a charging notice) relating to any accounting period which the officer considers is appropriate in consequence of—
(a)
a charging notice,
(b)
any claim, election, application, notice or other representation relating to a charging notice, or
(c)
anything done by the Tribunal under paragraph 6(4) (powers of the Tribunal on an appeal).

(5)
Where a consequential amendment notice reduces the amount which is chargeable on a company as the additional amount for a relevant accounting period—
(a)
an officer of HMRC must exercise the power in sub-paragraph (1) so as to secure, so far as reasonably practicable, that relevant reliefs are treated in the same way as they were treated before any steps were taken under this Schedule in relation to them, and
(b)
any amount which was overpaid must be repaid.
(6)
In sub-paragraph (5), “relevant reliefs” means so much of any reliefs previously taken into account in calculating the additional amount chargeable on the company for the relevant accounting period in question as are referable to the amount by which that additional amount is reduced.
(7)
Subject to sub-paragraph (8), paragraphs 61 to 64 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 apply in relation to the following as they apply in relation to a discovery assessment—

a charging notice, and

a consequential amendment notice.

Where a company is required to pay an additional amount for a relevant accounting period in accordance with a charging notice—
(a)
any discovery assessment ceases to have effect so far as it relates to that additional amount, and
(b)
any claim, election, application or notice ceases to have effect so far as it relates to that discovery assessment.

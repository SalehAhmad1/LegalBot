for a person charged with an offence under paragraph (1) in respect of any of the things mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) or (f) to prove that the person had no intent to defraud, and

(4)
For the purpose of such an investigation any obligation imposed on a person by any provision of the Companies Acts to produce documents or give information to, or otherwise to assist, inspectors so appointed is to be regarded as an obligation similarly to assist the Department in its investigation.

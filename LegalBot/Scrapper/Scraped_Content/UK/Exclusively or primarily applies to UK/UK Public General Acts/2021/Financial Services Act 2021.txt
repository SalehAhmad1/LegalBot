(10)

Assets requirements
(1)
This section makes provision about a requirement imposed on a non-authorised parent undertaking of an FCA investment firm (“N”) under section 143K—
(a)
prohibiting the disposal of, or other dealing with, any of N's assets (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) or restricting such disposals or dealings, or
(b)
requiring that some or all of N's assets, or some or all assets belonging to consumers (as defined in section 1G) but held by N or to N's order, must be transferred to and held by a trustee approved by the FCA.
(2)
If the FCA—
(a)
imposes a requirement described in subsection (1)(a), and
(b)
gives notice of the requirement to an institution with whom N keeps an account,
the notice has the effects set out in subsection (3).
(3)
Those effects are that—
(a)
the institution does not act in breach of a contract with N if, having been instructed by N (or on N's behalf) to transfer a sum or otherwise make a payment out of N's account, it refuses to do so in the reasonably held belief that complying with the instruction would be incompatible with the requirement, and
(b)
if the institution complies with such an instruction, it is liable to pay to the FCA an amount equal to the amount transferred from, or otherwise paid out of, N's account in contravention of the requirement.
(4)
If the FCA imposes a requirement described in subsection (1)(b), no assets held by a person as trustee in accordance with the requirement may, while the requirement is in force, be released or dealt with except with the consent of the FCA.
(5)
If, while a requirement described in subsection (1)(b) is in force, N creates a charge over any assets of N held in accordance with the requirement, the charge is (to the extent that it confers security over the assets) void against the liquidator and N's creditors.
(6)
Assets held by a person as trustee are to be taken to be held by the trustee in accordance with a requirement mentioned in subsection (1)(b) only if—
(a)

This paragraph makes provision about a requirement imposed on a Gibraltar-based person (“G”) by a UK regulator under this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
prohibiting the disposal of, or other dealing with, any of G's assets (whether in the United Kingdom, Gibraltar or elsewhere) or restricting such disposals or dealings, or

requiring that some or all of G's assets, or some or all assets belonging to consumers (as defined in section 1G) but held by G or to G's order, must be transferred to and held by a trustee approved by the UK regulator.
(2)
If a UK regulator—
(a)
imposes a requirement described in sub-paragraph (1)(a), and
(b)
gives notice of the requirement to an institution with whom G keeps an account,
the notice has the effects set out in sub-paragraph (3).
(3)
Those effects are that—
(a)
the institution does not act in breach of a contract with G if, having been instructed by G (or on G's behalf) to transfer a sum or otherwise make a payment out of G's account, it refuses to do so in the reasonably held belief that complying with the instruction would be incompatible with the requirement, and
(b)
if the institution complies with such an instruction, it is liable to pay to the UK regulator an amount equal to the amount transferred from, or otherwise paid out of, G's account in contravention of the requirement.
(4)
If a UK regulator imposes a requirement described in sub-paragraph (1)(b), no assets held by a person as trustee in accordance with the requirement may, while the requirement is in force, be released or dealt with except with the consent of the UK regulator.
(5)
If, while a requirement described in sub-paragraph (1)(b) is in force, G creates a charge over any assets of G held in accordance with the requirement, the charge is (to the extent that it confers security over the assets) void against the liquidator and G's creditors.
(6)
Assets held by a person as trustee are to be taken to be held by the trustee in accordance with a requirement mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b) only if—
(a)
G has given the trustee a written notice that those assets are to be held by the trustee in accordance with the requirement, or
(b)
they are assets into which assets to which paragraph (a) applies have been transposed by the trustee on the instruction of G.
(7)
A person who contravenes sub-paragraph (4) commits an offence and is liable—
(a)
on summary conviction in England and Wales, to a fine;
(b)
on summary conviction in Scotland or Northern Ireland, to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.
(8)
In this paragraph, references to imposing a requirement (however expressed) include imposing a requirement by varying an existing requirement.
(9)
In this paragraph, “charge” includes a mortgage (or, in Scotland, a security over property).
(10)
Sub-paragraphs (4) and (6) do not affect any equitable interest or remedy in favour of a person who is a beneficiary of a trust as a result of a requirement described in sub-paragraph (1)(b).
Further provision about requirements
54
(1)

Contravention of requirement imposed under this Part
55
(1)
Contravention of a requirement imposed under this Part of this Schedule does not—
(a)
make a person guilty of an offence,
(b)
make a transaction void or unenforceable, or
(c)
give rise to a right of action for breach of statutory duty, subject to sub-paragraph (2).
(2)
A contravention of a requirement imposed under this Part of this Schedule is actionable at the suit of a person who suffers loss as a result of the contravention where—
(a)
the action would be brought at the suit of a private person, or
(b)
the conditions in sub-paragraph (3) are met,
subject to the defences and other incidents applying to actions for breach of statutory duty.
(3)
The conditions mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)(b) are that—
(a)
the action would be brought by a person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity on behalf of a private person, and
(b)
any remedy would be exclusively for the benefit of that private person and could not be obtained through an action brought otherwise than at the suit of the person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity.
(4)

“Expenditure qualifying under section 9(2) of FA 2021 130%
Expenditure qualifying under section 9(3) of that Act 50%
Expenditure qualifying under section 9(4) of that Act 100%”.

(6)
This section has effect as if it were contained in Chapter 4 of Part 2 of CAA 2001 (which, among other things, means that sections 5 and 50 of that Act are relevant for the purpose of determining when expenditure is incurred).
(7)
For the purpose of determining when expenditure is incurred for the purpose of subsection (2)(a) or (3)(b), if an amount of expenditure is incurred as a result of a contract entered into before 3 March 2021—
(a)
section 5 of CAA 2001 does not apply, and
(b)
the expenditure is instead treated for that purpose as incurred when the contract was entered into (whether or not an unconditional obligation to pay it arises on or after that date).
(8)

the person to whom they are bailed or hired is the person who incurs the expenditure.”
(9)
General exclusion 6 in section 46(2) of CAA 2001 (expenditure on provision of plant or machinery for leasing) does not prevent expenditure being super-deduction expenditure or SR allowance expenditure if the plant or machinery is provided for leasing under an excluded lease of background plant or machinery for a building (as defined by section 70R of that Act).

(11)
In this section “ring fence trade” means a ring fence trade in respect of which tax is chargeable under section 330(1) of CTA 2010 (supplementary charge in respect of ring fence trades).10

super-deduction expenditure incurred in a chargeable period that ends on or after 1 April 2023;
(b)

(6)
In this section, and in sections 11 to 14—
“super-deduction expenditure” and “super-deduction” are to be construed in accordance with section 9(2);
“SR allowance expenditure” and “SR allowance” are to be construed in accordance with section 9(3);
“additional VAT liability” has the meaning given by section 547(1) of CAA 2001.11
Reduced super-deduction
(1)
Subsection (2) applies where a person incurs super-deduction expenditure in a chargeable period (“the relevant period”) that ends on or after 1 April 2023.
(2)
Where this subsection applies, section 9(1)(b) applies as if for “130%” there were substituted the relevant percentage.
(3)
Subsection (4) applies where a person becomes entitled in a chargeable period (“the relevant period”) that ends on or after 1 April 2023 to a super-deduction as a result of section 236(2) in respect of an additional VAT liability that is regarded (as a result of that section) as super-deduction expenditure.
(4)
Where this subsection applies, section 9(1)(b) applies as if for “130%” there were substituted—
(a)
where the person becomes entitled to the super-deduction before 1 April 2023, the relevant percentage, or
(b)
otherwise, “100%”.
(5)
For the purposes of subsections (2) and (4)(a), the relevant percentage is X% where X is determined by—
(a)
dividing the number of days in the relevant period before 1 April 2023 by the total number of days in that period,
(b)
multiplying that amount by 30, and
(c)
adding 100 to the result.12
Disposal of assets where super-deduction made
(1)
This section applies to plant or machinery in respect of which a person incurred super-deduction expenditure if a super-deduction was made in respect of some or all of that expenditure.
(2)
Where a disposal event occurs in relation to plant or machinery to which this section applies, the person who incurred relevant super-deduction expenditure in respect of it is liable to a balancing charge for the chargeable period in which the event occurs (whether or not the person is also liable to any other balancing charge for that period).
(3)
The amount of the balancing charge is, subject to subsection (6), the relevant proportion of the disposal value of the plant or machinery (see sections 61 to 63 of CAA 2001 which, among other provisions of Part 2 of that Act, contain provision about disposal values).
(4)
The relevant proportion is determined by dividing the amount of relevant super-deduction expenditure incurred in respect of the plant or machinery by the amount of total relevant expenditure in relation to it.
(5)
For the purposes of this section—
super-deduction expenditure is “relevant” if a super-deduction was made in respect of it;
“total relevant expenditure” in relation to plant or machinery means the sum of the following expenditure incurred in respect of it—
(a)
relevant super-deduction expenditure;
(b)
any expenditure in respect of which any other first-year allowance was made;
(c)
any expenditure that was allocated to a pool for any chargeable period (including for the period in which the disposal event occurs).
(6)
If the disposal event occurs in a chargeable period that commenced before 1 April 2023 the amount of the balancing charge is the amount determined under subsection (3) multiplied by the relevant factor.
(7)
The relevant factor is 1.3 if the chargeable period ends before 1 April 2023.
(8)
If the chargeable period ends on or after 1 April 2023, the relevant factor is determined by—
(a)
dividing the number of days in the period before 1 April 2023 by the total number of days in that period,
(b)
multiplying that amount by 0.3, and
(c)
adding 1 to the result.
(9)
The balance of an amount of super-deduction expenditure in respect of which a super-deduction is made after deducting that super-deduction is to be treated as nil for the purposes of section 58(5)(b) and (6) of CAA 2001 (allocation of balance of first-year qualifying expenditure to a pool).
(10)
In relation to the chargeable period in which the disposal event occurred, TDR (see section 55(1)(b) of CAA 2001) for the pool to which the relevant super-deduction expenditure was allocated is to be reduced by the relevant proportion of the disposal value of the plant or machinery.
(11)
Section 135(1) of CAA 2001 (claim for deferment of balancing charges) does not apply in relation to a disposal event in respect of a ship to which this section applies.
(12)
This section has effect in relation to disposals occurring on or after 1 April 2021.13
Disposal of assets where SR allowance made
(1)
This section applies to plant or machinery in respect of which a person incurred SR allowance expenditure in a chargeable period (“the allowance period”) if an SR allowance was made in respect of some or all of that expenditure.
(2)
Where a disposal event occurs in relation to plant or machinery to which this section applies, the person who incurred relevant SR expenditure in respect of it is liable to a balancing charge for the chargeable period in which the event occurs (whether or not the person is also liable to any other balancing charge for that period).
(3)
The amount of the balancing charge is the relevant proportion of the disposal value of the plant or machinery (see sections 61 to 63 of CAA 2001 which, among other provisions of Part 2 of that Act, contain provision about disposal values).
(4)
The relevant proportion is determined by—
(a)
dividing the amount of relevant SR allowance expenditure incurred in respect of the plant or machinery by 2, and
(b)
dividing that amount by the amount of total relevant expenditure in relation to the plant or machinery.
(5)
For the purposes of this section—
SR allowance expenditure is “relevant” if an SR allowance was made in respect of it;
“total relevant expenditure” in relation to plant or machinery means the sum of the following expenditure incurred in respect of it—
(a)
relevant SR allowance expenditure,
(b)
any expenditure in respect of which any other first-year allowance was made, and
(c)
any expenditure that is not relevant SR allowance expenditure that was allocated to a pool for any chargeable period (including for the period in which the disposal event occurs).
(6)
In relation to the chargeable period in which the disposal event occurred, TDR (see section 55(1)(b) of CAA 2001) for the pool to which the SR allowance expenditure in respect of the plant or machinery was allocated is to be reduced by the amount of the balancing charge.
(7)
Section 135(1) of CAA 2001 (claim for deferment of balancing charges) does not apply in relation to a disposal event in respect of a ship to which this section applies.
(8)
This section has effect in relation to disposals occurring on or after 1 April 2021.14
Counteraction where arrangements are contrived etc
(1)
Any relevant tax advantage that would (in the absence of this section) be obtained as a result of relevant arrangements is to be counteracted by the making of such adjustments as are just and reasonable.
(2)
A tax advantage is “relevant” if that advantage is connected with a super-deduction or an SR allowance (for example, the obtaining of such a first-year allowance or the avoidance of a balancing charge under section 12 or 13).
(3)
Arrangements are “relevant” if—
(a)
the purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the arrangements is to obtain a relevant tax advantage, and
(b)
it is reasonable, taking account of all the relevant circumstances—
(i)
to conclude that the arrangements are, or include steps that are, contrived, abnormal or lacking a genuine commercial purpose, or
(ii)
to regard the arrangements as circumventing the intended limits of relief under CAA 2001 or otherwise exploiting shortcomings in that Act.
(4)
Any adjustments required to be made under this section (whether or not by an officer of Revenue and Customs) may be made by way of—
(a)
an assessment,
(b)
the modification of an assessment,
(c)
amendment or disallowance of a claim (whether a claim for a first-year allowance or otherwise),
or otherwise.
(5)
In this section—
“arrangements” includes any agreement, understanding, scheme, transaction or series of transactions (whether or not legally enforceable);
“tax advantage” is to be construed in accordance with section 577(4) of CAA 2001.
(6)
This section has effect in relation to any relevant arrangements entered into on or after 3 March 2021.[F115
Extension of temporary increase in annual investment allowance
(1)
In section 32(1) of FA 2019 (which increases the maximum amount of the annual investment allowance to £1,000,000 for the period of two years beginning with 1 January 2019), for “two years” substitute “ three years ”.
(2)
In consequence of the amendment made by subsection (1)—
(a)
in section 32(2) of that Act, for “2021” substitute “ 2022 ”,
(b)
in paragraph 2 of Schedule 13 to that Act and the heading before that paragraph, for “2021” (in each place) substitute “ 2022 ”,
(c)

(d)
in the heading for that Schedule, for “2021” substitute “ 2022 ”.]

the date on which P began to produce or import those components, or
(b)
if later, the date with effect from which the single taxable person referred to in the earlier direction became liable to be registered under this Part.
(5)
If, immediately before a direction (including a supplementary direction) is made under this section, any person named in the direction is registered under this Part, the person ceases to be liable to be so registered with effect from the later of—
(a)
the date with effect from which the single taxable person concerned became liable to be registered, and
(b)
the date of the direction.
(6)
A direction under this section must be given to each person named in it.

(4)
If, on any day in the control period, the purchaser is not a qualifying housing body because it ceases to exist (whether by virtue of a conversion into, or amalgamation with, another person or for any other reason), relief is not to be withdrawn under this paragraph unless—

another person (“the first successor”) has succeeded to the engagements of the purchaser, and
(b)
condition A or condition B is met (and if condition B is met, subject to sub-paragraph (7)).

(7)
If condition B is met because the first successor ceases to exist (whether by virtue of a conversion into, or amalgamation with, another person or for any other reason), relief is not to be withdrawn under this paragraph unless it would have been withdrawn by virtue of sub-paragraph (4) if references in sub-paragraphs (4) to (6)—
(a)
to the purchaser were references to the first successor, and
(b)
to the first successor were references to the person who has succeeded to the engagements of the first successor (“the second successor”).
(8)

(2)
For the purposes of a claim under this section with respect to a single-dwelling interest—

(b)
each day on which the conditions in subsection (1)(a) and (b) are met with respect to the interest is a “relievable day”;
(c)
references to “the relevant return” are to the annual tax on enveloped dwellings return for the chargeable period beginning with 1 April 2020 with respect to the interest.
(3)
Where a claim is made under this section with respect to a single-dwelling interest, HMRC must repay the total of the daily amounts for all the relievable days.
(4)
A claim under this section must be made by amending the relevant return under paragraph 3 of Schedule 33 to FA 2013 on the same basis as it would have been amended if, on each of the relievable days, the chargeable person had been entitled to claim the type of relief numbered 8 in the table in section 159A(9) of FA 2013.
(5)

“CHAPTER 12A
Allocation of dual inclusion income within group
Introduction
259ZM
Overview of Chapter
(1)
This Chapter contains provision that allows surplus dual inclusion income to be allocated within a group of companies.
(2)
Section 259ZMA contains the conditions that must be met for this Chapter to apply.
(3)
Subsection (2) of that section defines “the DII surplus” and subsection (3) of that section defines “the DII shortfall”.
(4)
Sections 259ZMB to 259ZMD contain provision allowing the unused part of the DII surplus of one company to be treated as dual inclusion income of another company in the same group, where it can be matched against the unused part of the DII shortfall of the other company.
(5)
Section 259ZME identifies when companies are in the same group.
Application of Chapter
259ZMA
Circumstances in which Chapter applies
(1)
This Chapter applies if conditions A to E are met.
(2)
Condition A is that, for an accounting period (“the surplus period”), the dual inclusion income of a company (“company A”) exceeds its counteraction amount.
In this Chapter, the amount of the excess is referred to as “the DII surplus”.
(3)
Condition B is that, for an accounting period (“the shortfall period”), the counteraction amount of another company (“company B”) exceeds its dual inclusion income.
In this Chapter, the amount of the excess is referred to as “the DII shortfall”.
(4)
See section 259ZMF for the meanings of “dual inclusion income” and “counteraction amount”.
(5)
Condition C is that there is a period (“the overlapping period”) that is common to both the surplus period and the shortfall period (and see subsections (8) and (9)).
(6)
Condition D is that there is a time during the overlapping period when both company A and company B are within the charge to corporation tax.
(7)
Condition E is that there is a time during the overlapping period when company A and company B are members of the same group of companies (see section 259ZME).
(8)
Subsection (9) applies if, during any part of the overlapping period—
(a)
either company A or company B is not within the charge to corporation tax, or
(b)
company A and company B are not members of the same group of companies.
(9)
That part is treated as not forming part of the overlapping period but instead as—
(a)
forming part of the surplus period that is not included in the overlapping period, and
(b)
forming part of the shortfall period that is not included in the overlapping period.
Allocation of DII surplus
259ZMB
Claims for allocation of DII surplus
(1)
Company B may make a claim (an “allocation claim”) for all or part of the unused part of the DII surplus of company A for the overlapping period (see section 259ZMC) to be allocated to company B for the shortfall period, if the following requirements are met.
Requirement 1 Company A consents to the allocation claim.
Requirement 2 The allocation claim identifies the amount of the DII surplus to which it relates.
Requirement 3 Company B has an amount of ordinary income for the shortfall period (“matchable income”) that—
(a)
is not dual inclusion income, and
(b)
is equal to or exceeds the amount of the DII surplus to which the allocation claim relates.
Requirement 4 The allocation claim identifies the amount of matchable income to which the claim relates.
Requirement 5 The amount of matchable income to which the claim relates—
(a)
is equal to the amount of the DII surplus to which the claim relates, and
(b)
does not exceed the unused part of the DII shortfall of company B for the shortfall period (see section 259ZMD).
(2)
If company B makes an allocation claim—
(a)
the amount of company A's dual inclusion income for the surplus period is reduced by the amount of matchable income to which the claim relates, and
(b)
the amount of matchable income to which the claim relates is treated in relation to company B as if the following assumptions were made.
(3)
The assumptions are that—
(a)
things done by or to company A in relation to that amount are treated as done by or to company B, and
(b)
all other factual circumstances (or circumstances treated as existing as a result of any provision made by this Part) in relation to that amount are unchanged.
259ZMC
The unused part of the DII surplus
(1)
This section identifies the unused part of the DII surplus of company A for the overlapping period, for the purposes of an allocation claim made by company B (“the current allocation claim”).
(2)
The unused part of the DII surplus of company A for the overlapping period is the amount equal to—
(a)
the DII surplus for the overlapping period (see subsection (3)), less
(b)
the amount of prior allocations for that period (see subsections (4) to (7)).
(3)
To determine the DII surplus for the overlapping period—
(a)
take the proportion of the surplus period included in the overlapping period, and
(b)
apply that proportion to the DII surplus for the surplus period.
The DII surplus for the overlapping period is the amount given as a result of paragraph (b).
(4)
To determine the amount of prior allocations for the overlapping period—
(a)
identify any prior allocation claims for the purposes of this section (see subsection (5)), and
(b)
take the steps set out in subsection (6) in relation to each such claim.
The amount of prior allocations for the overlapping period is the total of the previously used amounts given at Step 3 in subsection (6) for all the prior allocation claims.
(5)
An allocation claim is a prior allocation claim for the purposes of this section if—
(a)
it is an allocation claim made by a company in respect of all or part of the DII surplus of company A for the surplus period,
(b)
it is made before the current allocation claim, and
(c)
it has not been withdrawn.
(6)
These are the steps referred to in subsection (4)(b) to be taken in relation to each prior allocation claim.
Step 1 Identify the overlapping period for the prior allocation claim.
Step 2 Identify any period that is common to the overlapping period for the current allocation claim and the overlapping period for the prior allocation claim. If there is a common period, go to Step 3. If there is no common period, there is no previously allocated amount in relation to the prior allocation claim (and ignore Step 3).
Step 3 Determine the previously allocated amount of the DII surplus in relation to the prior allocation claim (see subsection (7)).
(7)
To determine the previously allocated amount of the DII surplus in relation to the prior allocation claim—
(a)
take the proportion of the overlapping period for the prior allocation claim that is included in the common period identified at Step 2 in subsection (6) in relation to that claim, and
(b)
apply that proportion to the amount of the DII surplus allocated on the prior allocation claim.
The previously allocated amount of the DII surplus in relation to the prior allocation claim is the amount given as a result of paragraph (b).
(8)
If two or more allocation claims are made at the same time, for the purposes of this section treat the claims as made—
(a)
in such order as the companies making them may jointly elect, or
(b)
if no such election is made, in such order as an officer of Revenue and Customs may direct.
(9)
For the purposes of Step 3 in subsection (6), the amount of the DII surplus allocated on a prior allocation claim is determined on the basis that an amount is allocated on the claim before it is allocated on a later claim.
(10)
If the use of the proportion mentioned in subsection (3) or (7) would, in the circumstances of a particular case, produce a result that is unjust or unreasonable, the proportion is to be modified so far as necessary to produce a result that is just and reasonable.
259ZMD
The unused part of the DII shortfall
(1)
This section identifies the unused part of the DII shortfall of company B for the shortfall period, for the purposes of an allocation claim made by company B (“the current allocation claim”).
(2)
The unused part of the DII shortfall of company B for the shortfall period is the amount equal to—
(a)
the DII shortfall for the shortfall period, less
(b)
the amount of prior matches for the shortfall period (see subsections (3) to (5)).
(3)
To determine the amount of prior matches for the shortfall period—
(a)
identify any prior allocation claims for the purposes of this section (see subsection (4)), and
(b)
determine the previously matched amount of the DII shortfall in relation to each prior allocation claim (see subsection (5)).
The amount of prior matches for the shortfall period is the total of the previously matched amounts of the DII shortfall in relation to all the prior allocation claims.
(4)
An allocation claim is a prior allocation claim for the purposes of this section if—
(a)
it is an allocation claim made by company B for the shortfall period,
(b)
it is made before the current allocation claim, and
(c)
it has not been withdrawn.
(5)
The previously matched amount of the DII shortfall in relation to a prior allocation claim is the amount that is treated as dual inclusion income of company B for the shortfall period as a result of the claim (see section 259ZMB(3)(a)).
(6)
If two or more allocation claims are made at the same time, for the purposes of this section treat the claims as made—
(a)
in such order as company B may elect, or
(b)
if no such election is made, in such order as an officer of Revenue and Customs may direct.
(7)
For the purposes of subsection (3)(b), the amount of the DII shortfall matched in relation to a prior allocation claim is determined on the basis that an amount is matched on the claim before it is matched on a later claim.

In this Schedule “a non-UK scheme” means any provision of the law of a member State which implements Section 3 of Chapter 6 of Title XII of the VAT Directive.
(2)
In relation to a non-UK scheme, references to the “administering member State” are to the member State under whose law the scheme is established.
Exemption from requirement to register under this Act
17
(1)
A participant in a non-UK scheme is not required to be registered under this Act by virtue of making scheme supplies in respect of which the participant is required to make returns under that other scheme.
(2)
Sub-paragraph (1) overrides any contrary provision in this Act.
(3)
Where a participant in a non-UK scheme who is not registered under this Act (“the unregistered person”) makes relevant supplies, it is to be assumed for all purposes of this Act relating to the determination of—
(a)
whether or not VAT is chargeable under this Act on those supplies,
(b)
how much VAT is chargeable under this Act on those supplies,
(c)
the time at which those supplies are treated as taking place, and
(d)
any other matter that the Commissioners may specify by regulations,
that the unregistered person is registered under this Act.

A person (“P”) who—

is also registered, or required to be registered, under this Act,
is not required to discharge any obligation placed on them as a taxable person, to the extent that the obligation relates to relevant supplies.
(2)
The reference in sub-paragraph (1) to an obligation placed on P as a taxable person is to an obligation—

to which P is subject under or by virtue of this Act, and

(2)
See also the modifications in paragraph 23.
(3)
In this Schedule “relevant non-UK return” means a non-UK return (see paragraph 38(1)) that is required to be made (wholly or partly) in respect of scheme supplies that are treated as made in the United Kingdom.
Assessments in connection with increase in consideration: modifications
23
(1)
Sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) make modifications of sections 73 and 76 which—
(a)
have effect for the purposes of this Schedule, and
(b)
are in addition to any other modifications of those sections made by this Schedule.
(2)
Section 73 has effect as if, after subsection (3), there were inserted—
“(3A)
Where a person has failed to make an amendment or notification that the person is required to make under paragraph 33 of Schedule 9ZD in respect of an increase in the consideration for a UK supply (as defined in paragraph 33(7)), the Commissioners may assess the amount of VAT due from the person as a result of the increase to the best of their judgement and notify it to the person.
(3B)
An assessment under subsection (3A)—
(a)
is of VAT due for the tax period mentioned in paragraph 33(1)(a) of Schedule 9ZD;
(b)
must be made within the time limits provided for in section 77, and must not be made after the end of the period of—
(i)
2 years after the end of the tax period referred to in paragraph 33(1)(a) of Schedule 9ZD, or if later,
(ii)
one year after evidence of facts sufficient in the opinion of the Commissioners to justify making the assessment comes to their knowledge.
(3C)
Subject to section 77, where further evidence such as is mentioned in subsection (3B)(b)(ii) comes to the Commissioners' knowledge after they have made an assessment under subsection (3A), another assessment may be made under that subsection, in addition to any earlier assessment.”
(3)
The reference in section 73(9) to subsection (1) of that section is taken to include a reference to section 73(3A) (treated as inserted by sub-paragraph (2)).
(4)
Section 76 (assessment of amounts due by way of penalty, interest or surcharge) is to be read as if the reference in subsection (5) of that section to section 73(1) included a reference to section 73(3A) (treated as inserted by sub-paragraph (2)).
Assessments: consequential modifications
24
References to prescribed accounting periods in the following provisions are to be read in accordance with the modifications made by paragraphs 22 and 23—
(a)
section 74 (interest on VAT recovered or recoverable by assessment);
(b)
section 76 (assessment of amounts due by way of penalty, interest or surcharge);
(c)
section 77 (assessments: time limits etc).
Deemed amendments of relevant non-UK returns
25
(1)
Where a person who has made a relevant non-UK return makes a claim under paragraph 31(7)(b) (overpayments) in relation to an error in the return, the relevant non-UK return is taken for the purposes of this Act to have been amended by the information in the claim.
(2)
Where a person who has made a relevant non-UK return gives the Commissioners a notice relating to the return under paragraph 33(2)(b) (increase or decrease in consideration), the relevant non- UK return is taken for the purposes of this Act to have been amended by that information.
(3)
Where (in a case not falling within sub-paragraph (1) or (2)) a person who has made a relevant non-UK return notifies the Commissioners (after the expiry of the period during which the non-UK return may be amended under Article 61 of the Implementing Regulation) of a change that needs to be made to the return to correct an error, or rectify an omission, in it, the relevant non-UK return is taken for the purposes of this Act to have been amended by that information.
Interest on VAT: “reckonable date”
26
(1)
Sub-paragraph (2) states the “reckonable date” for the purposes of section 74(1) and (2) for any case where an amount carrying interest under that section—
(a)
is an amount assessed under section 73(2) (refunds etc) in reliance on paragraph 22, or that could have been so assessed, and
(b)
was correctly paid or credited to the person, but would not have been paid or credited to the person had the facts been as they later turn out to be.
(2)
The “reckonable date” is the first day after the end of the tax period in which the events occurred as a result of which the Commissioners were authorised to make the assessment (that was or could have been made) under section 73(2).
(3)
Sub-paragraph (4) states the “reckonable date” for any other case where an amount carrying interest under section 74 is assessed under section 74(1) or (2) in reliance on paragraph 22, or could have been so assessed.
(4)
The “reckonable date” is taken to be the latest date by which a non- UK return was required to be made for the tax period to which the amount assessed relates.
(5)
Where section 74(1) or (2) (interest on VAT recovered or recoverable by assessment) applies in relation to an amount assessed under section 73(3A) (treated as inserted by paragraph 23(2)), the “reckonable date” for the purposes of section 74(1) or (2) is taken to be the day after the end of the tax period referred to in paragraph 33(2).
Default surcharge: notice of special surcharge period
27
(1)
A person who is required to make a relevant non-UK return for a tax period is regarded for the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 28 as being in default in respect of that period if either—
(a)
conditions 1A and 2A are met, or
(b)
conditions 1B and 2B are met,
(but see also paragraph 29).
(2)
The conditions are as follows—
(a)
condition 1A is that the tax authorities for the administering member State have not received the return by the deadline for submitting it;
(b)
condition 2A is that those tax authorities have, in accordance with Article 60a of the Implementing Regulation, issued a reminder of the obligation to submit the return;
(c)
condition 1B is that, by the deadline for submitting the return, those tax authorities have received the return but have not received the amount of VAT shown on the return as payable by the person in respect of the tax period;
(d)
condition 2B is that those tax authorities have, in accordance with Article 60a of the Implementing Regulation, issued a reminder of the VAT outstanding.
(3)
The Commissioners may serve on a person who is in default in respect of a tax period a notice (a “special surcharge liability notice”) specifying a period—
(a)
ending on the first anniversary of the last day of that tax period, and
(b)
beginning on the date of the notice.
(4)
A period specified under sub-paragraph (3) is a “special surcharge period”.
(5)
If a special surcharge liability notice is served in respect of a tax period which ends on or before the day on which an existing special surcharge period ends, the special surcharge period specified in that notice must be expressed as a continuation of the existing special surcharge period (so that the existing period and its extension are regarded as a single special surcharge period).
Further default after service of notice
28
(1)
If a person on whom a special surcharge liability notice has been served—
(a)
is in default in respect of a tax period ending within the special surcharge period specified in (or extended by) that notice, and
(b)
has outstanding special scheme VAT for that tax period,
the person is to be liable to a surcharge of the amount given by sub-paragraph (2).
(2)
The surcharge is equal to whichever is the greater of—
(a)
£30, and
(b)
the specified percentage of the person's outstanding special scheme VAT for the tax period.
(3)
The specified percentage depends on whether the tax period is the first, second or third etc period in respect of which the person is in default and has outstanding special scheme VAT, and is—
(a)
for the first such tax period, 2%;
(b)
for the second such tax period, 5%;
(c)
for the third such tax period, 10%;
(d)
for each such tax period after the third, 15%.
(4)
“Special scheme VAT”, in relation to a person, means VAT that the person is liable to pay to the tax authorities for the administering member State under a non-UK scheme in respect of scheme supplies treated as made in the United Kingdom.
(5)
A person has “outstanding special scheme VAT” for a tax period if some or all of the special scheme VAT for which the person is liable in respect of that period has not been paid by the deadline for the person to submit a non-UK return for that period (and the amount unpaid is referred to in sub-paragraph (2)(b) as “the person's outstanding special scheme VAT” for the tax period).
Default surcharge: exceptions for reasonable excuse etc
29
(1)
A person who would otherwise have been liable to a surcharge under paragraph 28(1) is not to be liable to the surcharge if the person satisfies the Commissioners or, on appeal, the tribunal that, in the case of a default which is material to the surcharge—
(a)
the non-UK return or, as the case may be, the VAT shown on that return, was despatched at such a time and in such manner that it was reasonable to expect that it would be received by the tax authorities for the administering member State within the appropriate time limit, or
(b)
there is a reasonable excuse for the return or the VAT not having been so despatched.
(2)
Where sub-paragraph (1) applies to a person—
(a)
the person is treated as not having been in default in respect of the tax period in question, and
(b)
accordingly, any special surcharge liability notice the service of which depended on that default is regarded as not having been served.
(3)
A default is “material” to a surcharge if—
(a)
it is the default which gives rise to the surcharge, under paragraph 28(1), or
(b)
it is a default which was taken into account in the service of the special surcharge liability notice on which the surcharge depends and the person concerned has not previously been liable to a surcharge in respect of a tax period ending within the special surcharge period specified in or extended by that notice.
(4)
A default is left out of account for the purposes of paragraphs 27(3) and 28(1) if—
(a)
the conduct by virtue of which the person is in default is also conduct falling within section 69(1) (breaches of regulatory provisions), and
(b)
by reason of that conduct the person concerned is assessed to a penalty under that section.
(5)
If the Commissioners, after consultation with the Treasury, so direct, a default in respect of a tax period specified in the direction is to be left out of account for the purposes of paragraphs 27(3) and 28(1).
(6)
Section 71(1) (meaning of “reasonable excuse”) applies for the purposes of this paragraph as it applies for the purposes of sections 59 to 70.
Interest in certain cases of official error
30
(1)
Section 78 (interest in certain cases of official error) applies as follows in relation to a case where, due to an error on the part of the Commissioners—
(a)
a person has accounted under a non-UK scheme for an amount by way of UK VAT that was not UK VAT due from the person, and as a result the Commissioners are liable under paragraph 31 to pay (or repay) an amount to the person, or
(b)
(in a case not falling within paragraph (a)), a person has paid, in accordance with an obligation under a non-UK scheme, an amount by way of UK VAT that was not UK VAT due from the person and which the Commissioners are in consequence liable to repay to the person.
(2)
Section 78 has effect as if the condition in section 78(1)(a) were met in relation to that person.
(3)
In the application of section 78 as a result of this paragraph, section 78(12)(b) is read as providing that any reference in that section to a return is to a return required to be made under a non-UK scheme.
(4)
In section 78, as it applies as a result of this paragraph, “output tax” has the meaning that expression would have if the reference in section 24(2) to a “taxable person” were to a “person”.
Overpayments
31
(1)
A person may make a claim if the person—
(a)
has made a non-UK return for a tax period relating wholly or partly to scheme supplies treated as made in the United Kingdom,
(b)
has accounted to the tax authorities for the administering member State for VAT in respect of those supplies, and
(c)
in doing so has brought into account as UK VAT due to those authorities an amount (“the overpaid amount”) that was not UK VAT due to them.
(2)
A person may make a claim if the person has, as a participant in a non-UK scheme, paid (to the tax authorities for the administering member State or to the Commissioners) an amount by way of UK VAT that was not UK VAT due (“the overpaid amount”), otherwise than in the circumstances mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(c).
(3)
A person who is or has been a participant in a non-UK scheme may make a claim if the Commissioners—
(a)
have assessed the person to VAT for a tax period, and

(b)
after setting any sums against that amount under or by virtue of this Act, some or all of the amount remains to the person's credit,
the Commissioners must pay (or repay) to the person so much of the amount as remains to the person's credit.
(7)
The reference in sub-paragraph (1) to a claim is to a claim made—
(a)
by correcting, in accordance with Article 61 of the Implementing Regulation, the error in the non-UK return mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a), or
(b)
(after the expiry of the period during which the non-UK return may be amended under Article 61) to the Commissioners.
(8)
Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) do not require any amount to be repaid except to the extent that is required by Article 63 of the Implementing Regulation.
Overpayments: supplementary
32
(1)
In section 80 (credit for, or repayment of, overstated or overpaid VAT), subsections (3) to (3C) (unjust enrichment) and (4A), (4C) and (6) (recovery by assessment of amounts wrongly credited) have effect as if—
(a)
a claim—
(i)
under paragraph 31(1) were a claim under section 80(1),
(ii)
under paragraph 31(2) were a claim under section 80(1B), and
(iii)
under paragraph 31(3) were a claim under section 80(1A);

(2)
In section 80(3) to (3C), (4A), (4C) and (6), as modified by sub-paragraph (1), references to the crediting of amounts are to be read as including the payment of amounts.
(3)
The Commissioners are not liable to repay the overpaid amount on a claim made—
(a)
under paragraph 31(2), or
(b)
as mentioned in paragraph 31(7)(b),
if the claim is made more than 4 years after the relevant date.
(4)
On a claim made under paragraph 31(3), the Commissioners are not liable to credit the amount not due if the claim is made more than 4 years after the relevant date.
(5)

(b)
in the case of a claim under paragraph 31(1) resulting from an incorrect disclosure, the end of the tax period in which the disclosure was made;
(c)
in the case of a claim under paragraph 31(2), the date on which the payment was made;
(d)
in the case of a claim under paragraph 31(3), the end of the quarter in which the assessment was made.
(6)
A person makes an “incorrect disclosure” where—
(a)
the person discloses to the tax authorities in question (whether the Commissioners or the tax authorities for the administering member State) that the person has not brought into account for a tax period an amount of UK VAT due for the period (“the disclosed amount”),
(b)
the disclosure is made in a later tax period, and
(c)
some or all of the disclosed amount is not in fact VAT due.
Increase or decrease in consideration for a supply
33
(1)
This paragraph applies where—
(a)
a person makes a non-UK return for a tax period (“the affected tax period”) relating (wholly or partly) to a UK supply, and
(b)
after the return has been made the amount of the consideration for the UK supply increases or decreases.
(2)
The person must, in the tax period in which the increase or decrease is accounted for in the person's business accounts—
(a)
amend the non-UK return to take account of the increase or decrease, or
(b)
(if the period during which the person is entitled under Article 61 of the Implementing Regulation to amend the non-UK return has expired) notify the Commissioners of the adjustment needed to the figures in the non-UK return because of the increase or decrease.
(3)
Where the change to which an amendment or notice under sub-paragraph (2) relates is an increase in the consideration for a UK supply, the person must pay to the tax authorities for the administering member State (in accordance with Article 62 of the Implementing Regulation) or, in a case falling within sub-paragraph (2)(b), the Commissioners, the difference between—
(a)
the amount of VAT that was chargeable on the supply before the increase in consideration, and
(b)
the amount of VAT that is chargeable in respect of the whole of the increased consideration for the supply.
(4)
Where the change to which an amendment or notice under sub-paragraph (2) relates is a decrease in the consideration for a UK supply, the amendment or notice has effect as a claim; and where a claim is made the Commissioners must repay any VAT paid by the person that would not have been VAT due from the person had the consideration for the supply always been the decreased amount.
(5)
The Commissioners may by regulations specify—
(a)
the latest time by which, and the form and manner in which, a claim or other notice under sub-paragraph (2)(b) must be given;
(b)
the latest time by which, and the form in which, a payment under sub-paragraph (3) must be made in a case within sub-paragraph (2)(b).

has submitted a non-UK return to the tax authorities for the administering member State, and
(b)
amends the return to take account of the writing-off as a bad debt of the whole or part of the consideration for a scheme supply that is treated as made in the United Kingdom,
the amending of the return may be treated as the making of a claim to the Commissioners for the purposes of section 36(2) (bad debts: claim for refund of VAT).
Penalties for errors: disclosure
35
Where a person corrects a non-UK return in a way that constitutes telling the tax authorities for the administering member State about—
(a)
an inaccuracy in the return,
(b)
a supply of false information, or
(c)
a withholding of information,
the person is regarded as telling HMRC about that for the purposes of paragraph 9 of Schedule 24 to the Finance Act 2007.
Set-offs
36
Where a participant in a non-UK scheme is liable to pay UK VAT to the tax authorities for the administering member State in accordance with the scheme, the UK VAT is regarded for the purposes of section 130(6) of the Finance Act 2008 (set-off) as payable to the Commissioners.

(a)
section 83(1)(p)(i): (appeals against assessments under section 73(1) etc) applies as if the relevant non-UK return were a return under this Act, and

Where (in a case not falling within sub-paragraph (1) or (2)) a person who has made a relevant special scheme return notifies the Commissioners (after the expiry of the period during which the special scheme return may be amended under Article 61 of the Implementing Regulation) of a change that needs to be made to the return to correct an error, or rectify an omission, in it, the relevant special scheme return is taken for the purposes of this Act to have been amended by that information.
Interest on VAT: “reckonable date”
20
(1)
Sub-paragraph (2) states the “reckonable date” for the purposes of section 74(1) and (2) for any case where an amount carrying interest under that section—
(a)
is an amount assessed under section 73(2) (refunds etc) in reliance on paragraph 16, or that could have been so assessed, and
(b)
was correctly paid or credited to the person, but would not have been paid or credited to the person had the facts been as they later turn out to be.
(2)
The “reckonable date” is the first day after the end of the tax period in which the events occurred as a result of which the Commissioners were authorised to make the assessment (that was or could have been made) under section 73(2).
(3)
Sub-paragraph (4) states the “reckonable date” for any other case where an amount carrying interest under section 74 is assessed under section 74(1) or (2) in reliance on paragraph 16, or could have been so assessed.
(4)
The “reckonable date” is taken to be the latest date by which a non- UK return was required to be made for the tax period to which the amount assessed relates.
(5)
Where section 74(1) or (2) (interest on VAT recovered or recoverable by assessment) applies in relation to an amount assessed under section 73(3A) (treated as inserted by paragraph 17(2)), the “reckonable date” for the purposes of section 74(1) or (2) is taken to be the day after the end of the tax period referred to in paragraph 27(2).
Default surcharge: notice of special surcharge period
21
(1)
A person who is required to make a relevant special scheme return for a tax period is regarded for the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 22 as being in default in respect of that period if either—
(a)
conditions 1A and 2A are met, or
(b)
conditions 1B and 2B are met,
(but see also paragraph 23).
(2)
The conditions are as follows—
(a)
condition 1A is that the tax authorities for the administering member State have not received the return by the deadline for submitting it;
(b)
condition 2A is that those tax authorities have, in accordance with Article 60a of the Implementing Regulation, issued a reminder of the obligation to submit the return;
(c)
condition 1B is that, by the deadline for submitting the return, those tax authorities have received the return but have not received the amount of VAT shown on the return as payable by the person in respect of the tax period;
(d)
condition 2B is that those tax authorities have, in accordance with Article 60a of the Implementing Regulation, issued a reminder of the VAT outstanding.
(3)
The Commissioners may serve on a person who is in default in respect of a tax period a notice (a “special surcharge liability notice”) specifying a period—
(a)
ending on the first anniversary of the last day of that tax period, and
(b)
beginning on the date of the notice.
(4)
A period specified under sub-paragraph (3) is a “special surcharge period”.
(5)
If a special surcharge liability notice is served in respect of a tax period which ends on or before the day on which an existing special surcharge period ends, the special surcharge period specified in that notice must be expressed as a continuation of the existing special surcharge period (so that the existing period and its extension are regarded as a single special surcharge period).
Further default after service of notice
22
(1)
If a person on whom a special surcharge liability notice has been served—
(a)
is in default in respect of a tax period ending within the special surcharge period specified in (or extended by) that notice, and
(b)
has outstanding special scheme VAT for that tax period,
the person is to be liable to a surcharge of the amount given by sub-paragraph (2).
(2)
The surcharge is equal to whichever is the greater of—
(a)
£30, and
(b)
the specified percentage of the person's outstanding special scheme VAT for the tax period.
(3)
The specified percentage depends on whether the tax period is the first, second or third etc period in respect of which the person is in default and has outstanding special scheme VAT, and is—
(a)
for the first such tax period, 2%;
(b)
for the second such tax period, 5%;
(c)
for the third such tax period, 10%;
(d)
for each such tax period after the third, 15%.
(4)
“Special scheme VAT”, in relation to a person, means VAT that the person is liable to pay to the tax authorities for the administering member State under a special scheme in respect of qualifying supplies of goods treated as made in the United Kingdom.
(5)
A person has “outstanding special scheme VAT” for a tax period if some or all of the special scheme VAT for which the person is liable in respect of that period has not been paid by the deadline for the person to submit a special scheme return for that period (and the amount unpaid is referred to in sub-paragraph (2)(b) as “the person's outstanding special scheme VAT” for the tax period).
Default surcharge: exceptions for reasonable excuse etc
23
(1)
A person who would otherwise have been liable to a surcharge under paragraph 22(1) is not to be liable to the surcharge if the person satisfies the Commissioners or, on appeal, the tribunal that, in the case of a default which is material to the surcharge—
(a)
the special scheme return or, as the case may be, the VAT shown on that return, was despatched at such a time and in such manner that it was reasonable to expect that it would be received by the tax authorities for the administering member State within the appropriate time limit, or
(b)
there is a reasonable excuse for the return or the VAT not having been so despatched.
(2)
Where sub-paragraph (1) applies to a person—
(a)
the person is treated as not having been in default in respect of the tax period in question, and
(b)
accordingly, any special surcharge liability notice the service of which depended on that default is regarded as not having been served.
(3)
A default is “material” to a surcharge if—
(a)
it is the default which gives rise to the surcharge, under paragraph 22(1), or
(b)
it is a default which was taken into account in the service of the special surcharge liability notice on which the surcharge depends and the person concerned has not previously been liable to a surcharge in respect of a tax period ending within the special surcharge period specified in or extended by that notice.
(4)
A default is left out of account for the purposes of paragraphs 21(3) and 22(1) if—
(a)
the conduct by virtue of which the person is in default is also conduct falling within section 69(1) (breaches of regulatory provisions), and
(b)
by reason of that conduct the person concerned is assessed to a penalty under that section.
(5)
If the Commissioners, after consultation with the Treasury, so direct, a default in respect of a tax period specified in the direction is to be left out of account for the purposes of paragraphs 21(3) and 22(1).
(6)
Section 71(1) (meaning of “reasonable excuse”) applies for the purposes of this paragraph as it applies for the purposes of sections 59 to 70.
Interest in certain cases of official error
24
(1)
Section 78 (interest in certain cases of official error) applies as follows in relation to a case where, due to an error on the part of the Commissioners—
(a)
a person has accounted under a special scheme for an amount by way of UK VAT that was not UK VAT due from the person, and as a result the Commissioners are liable under paragraph 25 to pay (or repay) an amount to the person, or
(b)
(in a case not falling within paragraph (a)), a person has paid, in accordance with an obligation under a special scheme, an amount by way of UK VAT that was not UK VAT due from the person and which the Commissioners are in consequence liable to repay to the person.
(2)
Section 78 has effect as if the condition in section 78(1)(a) were met in relation to that person.
(3)
In the application of section 78 as a result of this paragraph, section 78(12)(b) is read as providing that any reference in that section to a return is to a return required to be made under a non-UK special scheme.
(4)
In section 78, as it applies as a result of this section, “output tax” has the meaning that expression would have if the reference in section 24(2) to a “taxable person” were to a “person”.
Overpayments
25
(1)
A person may make a claim if the person—
(a)
has made a special scheme return for a tax period relating wholly or partly to qualifying supplies of goods treated as made in the United Kingdom,
(b)
has accounted to the tax authorities for the administering member State for VAT in respect of those supplies, and
(c)
in doing so has brought into account as UK VAT due to those authorities an amount (“the overpaid amount”) that was not UK VAT due to them.
(2)
A person may make a claim if the person has, as a participant in a special scheme, paid (to the tax authorities for the administering member State or to the Commissioners) an amount by way of UK VAT that was not UK VAT due (“the overpaid amount”), otherwise than in the circumstances mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(c).
(3)
A person who is or has been a participant in a special scheme may make a claim if the Commissioners—

the Commissioners must pay (or repay) to the person so much of the amount as remains to the person's credit.
(7)
The reference in sub-paragraph (1) to a claim is to a claim made—
(a)
by correcting, in accordance with Article 61 of the Implementing Regulation, the error in the special scheme return mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a), or
(b)
(after the expiry of the period during which the special scheme return may be amended under Article 61) to the Commissioners.
(8)
Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) do not require any amount to be repaid except to the extent that is required by Article 63 of the Implementing Regulation.
Overpayments: supplementary
26
(1)
In section 80 (credit for, or repayment of, overstated or overpaid VAT), subsections (3) to (3C) (unjust enrichment) and (4A), (4C) and (6) (recovery by assessment of amounts wrongly credited) have effect as if—
(a)
a claim—
(i)
under paragraph 25(1) were a claim under section 80(1),
(ii)
under paragraph 25(2) were a claim under section 80(1B), and
(iii)
under paragraph 25(3) were a claim under section 80(1A);
(b)
references in that section to a prescribed accounting period included a tax period.
(2)
In section 80(3) to (3C), (4A), (4C) and (6), as modified by sub-paragraph (1), references to the crediting of amounts are to be read as including the payment of amounts.
(3)
The Commissioners are not liable to repay the overpaid amount on a claim made—
(a)
under paragraph 25(2), or
(b)
as mentioned in paragraph 25(7)(b),
if the claim is made more than 4 years after the relevant date.
(4)
On a claim made under paragraph 25(3), the Commissioners are not liable to credit the amount not due if the claim is made more than 4 years after the relevant date.

(b)
in the case of a claim under paragraph 25(1) resulting from an incorrect disclosure, the end of the tax period in which the disclosure was made;

in the case of a claim under paragraph 25(2), the date on which the payment was made;
(d)
in the case of a claim under paragraph 25(3), the end of the quarter in which the assessment was made.

(a)
the person discloses to the tax authorities in question (whether the Commissioners or the tax authorities for the administering member State) that the person has not brought into account for a tax period an amount of UK VAT due for the period (“the disclosed amount”),
(b)
the disclosure is made in a later tax period, and
(c)
some or all of the disclosed amount is not in fact VAT due.
Increase or decrease in consideration for a supply
27
(1)
This paragraph applies where—
(a)
a person makes a special scheme return for a tax period (“the affected tax period”) relating (wholly or partly) to a UK supply, and
(b)
after the return has been made the amount of the consideration for the UK supply increases or decreases.
(2)
The person must, in the tax period in which the increase or decrease is accounted for in the person's business accounts—
(a)
amend the special scheme return to take account of the increase or decrease, or
(b)
(if the period during which the person is entitled under Article 61 of the Implementing Regulation to amend the special scheme return has expired) notify the Commissioners of the adjustment needed to the figures in the special scheme return because of the increase or decrease.
(3)
Where the change to which an amendment or notice under sub-paragraph (2) relates is an increase in the consideration for a UK supply, the person must pay to the tax authorities for the administering member State (in accordance with Article 62 of the Implementing Regulation) or, in a case falling within sub-paragraph (2)(b), the Commissioners, the difference between—
(a)
the amount of VAT that was chargeable on the supply before the increase in consideration, and
(b)
the amount of VAT that is chargeable in respect of the whole of the increased consideration for the supply.
(4)
Where the change to which an amendment or notice under sub-paragraph (2) relates is a decrease in the consideration for a UK supply, the amendment or notice has effect as a claim; and where a claim is made the Commissioners must repay any VAT paid by the person that would not have been VAT due from the person had the consideration for the supply always been the decreased amount.
(5)
The Commissioners may by regulations specify—
(a)
the latest time by which, and the form and manner in which, a claim or other notice under sub-paragraph (2)(b) must be given;

(b)
amends the return to take account of the writing-off as a bad debt of the whole or part of the consideration for a qualifying supply of goods that is treated as made in the United Kingdom,
the amending of the return may be treated as the making of a claim to the Commissioners for the purposes of section 36(2) (bad debts: claim for refund of VAT).
Penalties for errors: disclosure
29
Where a person corrects a special scheme return in a way that constitutes telling the tax authorities for the administering member State about—
(a)
an inaccuracy in the return,

30
Where a participant in a special scheme is liable to pay UK VAT to the tax authorities for the administering member State in accordance with the scheme, the UK VAT is regarded for the purposes of section 130(6) of the Finance Act 2008 (set-off) as payable to the Commissioners.

Where, at a time during the control period, the use of all or part of the qualifying freeport land in a qualifying manner has ceased, that land, or that part of the land, is to be treated as being used exclusively in a qualifying manner if reasonable steps are being taken—
(a)
to ensure that it is used in that manner, or
(b)

(b)
whether relief allowed for the first transaction is withdrawn under Part 3 of this Schedule.

For those purposes this Schedule has effect as if—
(a)
references to the purchaser were references to the relevant person, and
(b)
the reference in paragraph 3(2)(d) to land held (as stock of the business) for resale without development or redevelopment were a reference to land held in that manner by the relevant person.
(4)
The first transaction does not qualify for relief under Part 2 of this Schedule except where it does so by virtue of this paragraph.
(5)
In this paragraph—
“the first transaction” has the same meaning as in section 71A or 73 (as appropriate);
“the relevant person” means the person, other than the financial institution, who entered into the arrangements mentioned in section 71A(1) or 73(1) (as appropriate).

An instrument containing regulations under paragraph 12 must be laid before the House of Commons after being made.
(2)
If the regulations are not approved by the House of Commons before the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which they are made, they cease to have effect at the end of that period (if they have not already ceased to have effect under sub-paragraph (3)).
(3)
If, on any day during that period of 28 days, the House of Commons, in proceedings on a motion that (or to the effect that) the regulations be approved, comes to a decision rejecting the regulations, they shall cease to have effect at the end of that day.
(4)
In reckoning any such period of 28 days, no account is to be taken of any time during which—
(a)
Parliament is prorogued or dissolved, or
(b)
the House of Commons is adjourned for more than four days.

(a)
carries on more than one business, and
(b)
in relation to two or more of those businesses (the “relevant businesses”), is required to make returns belonging to the same group of returns.
(2)
If the group of returns mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b) is group 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 4B or 4C, the person makes a single return belonging to that group for all of the relevant businesses and so there is a single group of returns of that description for those businesses.
(3)
If the group of returns mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b) is group 1B, 2B or 3B, there is a single group of returns of that description for all of the relevant businesses notwithstanding that the person makes separate returns belonging to that group for each of the relevant businesses.
(4)
Where there is a single group of returns of a particular description for two or more relevant businesses (see sub-paragraphs (2) and (3))—
(a)
the person has a single liability for points and penalties for those businesses;
(b)
any change to the number of relevant businesses does not affect the continuity of the group of returns or the penalty points that the person has for the group of returns.
(5)
For the purposes of this Schedule, references to a person who carries on more than one business include references to a person who is treated as carrying on more than one business by section 43(1) of VATA 1994 (groups of companies).

(a)
a limit on a person's liability to penalty points for a group of returns is specified, the limit applies separately in relation to the group of returns of that description for each division, and
(b)
a maximum number of penalty points for a group of returns is specified, the maximum applies separately in relation to the group of returns of that description for each division.

(b)
the due dates for the returns belonging to the digital reporting sub-group in question do not all fall within the same month of a calendar quarter,
sub-paragraph (3) is to be read in relation to that digital reporting sub-group as if references to a month were references to a calendar quarter.
(6)

Date C—
(a)
applies where, on date A, it was not reasonable to expect HMRC to be aware that the person was required to make the return (or the returns), and

(c)
when the penalty point is awarded in respect of the earlier failure (or earlier failures) an assessment of the penalty to which the person is liable may no longer be made because of sub-paragraph (1).

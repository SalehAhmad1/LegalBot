Civil proceedings

Amount of penalty: fixed amount
14
(1)
A penalty imposed on a licence holder under paragraph 9 or 10 for a contravention may not consist of or include a fixed amount exceeding 10% of the licence holder's qualifying turnover for the qualifying period.
(2)
A licence holder's qualifying turnover is the licence holder's turnover from its provision of air traffic services.
(3)
The qualifying period is the last regulatory year ending on or before the day on which the notice proposing the penalty is given under paragraph 11(1) (“the notice day”), except in the cases described in sub-paragraph (4).
(4)
Those cases are—
(a)
where a licence holder was not authorised to provide air traffic services in respect of a managed area throughout the last regulatory year that ends on or before the notice day;
(b)
where there is no regulatory year or the last regulatory year ended more than 12 months before the notice day;
(c)
where a licence holder has not provided the CAA with accounts prepared in accordance with the licence for the last regulatory year that ends on or before the notice day.
(5)
In those cases—
(a)
if the licence holder was authorised to provide air traffic services in respect of a managed area on the notice day, the qualifying period is the year ending with the notice day (or, if shorter, the period ending with the notice day during which the licence holder was authorised to provide such services in respect of such an area);
(b)
otherwise, the qualifying period is the year ending with the last day before the notice day on which the licence holder was authorised to provide air traffic services in respect of a managed area (or, if shorter, the period ending with the last day before the notice day during which the licence holder was authorised to provide such services in respect of such an area).
(6)
A licence holder's qualifying turnover for a qualifying period is to be taken to be the qualifying turnover for that period as reported in accounts that the licence holder is required to prepare by a licence condition, unless regulations under sub-paragraph (7) provide otherwise.
(7)
The Secretary of State may by regulations—
(a)
amend or otherwise modify the definition of qualifying turnover;
(b)
make provision about how a licence holder's qualifying turnover for a qualifying period is to be calculated.
(8)
The regulations may in particular—
(a)
make provision about cases in which turnover is or is not to be treated as qualifying turnover for a qualifying period;
(b)
provide that a licence holder's qualifying turnover for a qualifying period is to be taken to be the qualifying turnover reported in accounts specified or described in the regulations;
(c)
provide that a licence holder's qualifying turnover is to be calculated entirely or partly using accounting rules specified or described in the regulations.
(9)
In this paragraph “regulatory year”, in relation to a licence holder, means a year for which the licence holder was required to prepare accounts by a licence condition for air traffic services provided in respect of a managed area.
Amount of penalty: daily amount
15
(1)
In relation to a penalty under paragraph 9 or 10, a daily amount is an amount payable where the contravention in respect of which the penalty is imposed continues after it is imposed.
(2)
A penalty under paragraph 9 may not consist of or include a daily amount unless that contravention has been continuous since the end of the representation period for the contravention notice in which the contravention was specified.
(3)
A daily amount must not exceed 0.1% of the licence holder's qualifying turnover for the qualifying period.
(4)
A daily amount is payable in respect of each day in a period specified by the CAA in the notice under paragraph 12 stating that it has imposed the penalty.
(5)
A specified period during which daily amounts accumulate must be the period that the CAA considers appropriate, subject to sub-paragraphs (6) and (7).
(6)
The period must begin after the day on which the CAA gives the notice under paragraph 12.
(7)
The period must end before—
(a)
the day on which the contravention specified in the notice under paragraph 12 ceases, or
(b)
if more than one contravention is specified in that notice, the day on which the last of those contraventions ceases.
(8)
In this paragraph “qualifying turnover” and “qualifying period” have the same meaning as in paragraph 14.
Use of powers under Competition Act 1998
16
(1)
Before exercising a power listed in sub-paragraph (3), the CAA must consider whether it would be more appropriate to proceed under the Competition Act 1998.
(2)
The CAA must not exercise such a power to the extent that it considers it would be more appropriate to proceed under that Act.
(3)
Those powers are—
(a)
the power to give a contravention notice under paragraph 1;
(b)
the power to give an enforcement order under paragraph 3;
(c)
the power to give and confirm an urgent enforcement order under paragraphs 5 and 6;

Entitlement to claim compensation
(1)
An application for compensation under this Part may be made by or in respect of a person who suffered abuse while a child and while resident in an institution at some time between 1922 and 1995 (both inclusive); but this is subject to sections 3 and 4.
(2)
A reference to having suffered abuse is a reference to—
(a)
having suffered sexual, physical or emotional abuse or neglect or maltreatment,
(b)
having witnessed one or more other children suffer abuse of a kind referred to in paragraph (a),
(c)
having otherwise been exposed to a harsh environment, or
(d)
having been sent to Australia under the programme commonly known as the “Child Migrants Programme”.
(3)
“Institution” means an institution in Northern Ireland in which a body, society or organisation with responsibility for the care, health and welfare of children provided residential accommodation for children, took decisions about them and made provision for their day-to-day care.
(4)
A reference to an institution does not include a reference to an institution at which education was provided, other than—

(b)
a person authorised by that body, society or organisation.
(6)
But subsection (5) does not apply to a case within subsection (2)(c); and subsection (2)(c) is accordingly to be read as referring only to a person who was exposed to a harsh environment while in the institution in question.
(7)
The reference in subsection (1) to a person who suffered abuse while resident in an institution is, in a case within subsection (2)(d), to be read as a reference to a person who was resident in an institution immediately before being sent to Australia as mentioned in that provision.

An application for compensation under this Part is to be determined by the panel appointed under section 8 on the basis of—

any material provided in support of the application,
(b)
any material provided in response to a request by the panel (whether the request is made to the applicant, made for the purposes of subsection (2) or made for some other purpose),

any evidence admitted under subsection (3) or given in a hearing directed under that subsection,
(d)
any evidence provided or given pursuant to a notice under section 10,
(e)

The panel must, in so far as it is practicable to do so and in accordance with such provision as may be made in rules, request the body, society or organisation which provided residential accommodation in an institution to which the application relates to provide whatever information would enable the panel to verify the accuracy of information provided in support of the application.
(3)
The panel may, if it considers that there are exceptional circumstances which make it necessary to do so in the interests of justice—
(a)
allow fresh evidence to be admitted;
(b)
direct an oral hearing to be held with the evidence to be given on oath.
(4)
An oral hearing directed by the panel under subsection (3)(b) is to be held in private unless the panel considers that it would be in the interests of justice for the hearing to be held in public.
(5)
Where the panel decides that it needs access to the records of the Inquiry in order to determine the application, the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland must allow the panel access to those records in accordance with whatever restrictions are in force under section 8 of the Inquiry into Historical Institutional Abuse Act (Northern Ireland) 2013.
(6)
The entitlement to compensation on the application is not affected by—
(a)
whether or not any matters to which the application relates were reported to the police;
(b)
whether or not the person by or in respect of whom the application is made provided evidence to the Inquiry;
(c)
whether or not the person by or in respect of whom the application is made has been convicted of an offence.

After the panel has determined the application, the secretary to the Board must notify the applicant in writing of the determination; and the notification must be accompanied by a summary of the panel's reasons for the determination.
(8)
The duty under subsection (2) does not arise if the person by or in respect of whom the application is made provided evidence to the Inquiry.

(b)
to attend on one or more specified dates a hearing convened by the panel and to give oral evidence on oath to the panel.

A person to whom a notice under this section is given may make a claim to the panel that—

it is not reasonable in all the circumstances to require the person to comply with the notice.
(3)
On a claim under subsection (2), the panel may confirm, revoke or vary the notice.
(4)
A person who is required by a notice under this section to provide records or documents must, if doing so would disclose information about another person which is irrelevant to the determination of the application under this Part and the disclosure of which would breach an obligation of confidence, provide the records or documents in a redacted form.
(5)
A notice under this section has effect in spite of anything which would otherwise prohibit a person from complying with the notice.
(6)
But a requirement of a notice does not have effect if—
(a)
complying with the requirement would involve the disclosure of information which, although made in compliance with the requirement, would contravene the data protection legislation, or
(b)
the person would be entitled in proceedings before the High Court in Northern Ireland to refuse to comply with the requirement.
(7)
A person commits an offence if the person fails to comply with a requirement of a notice under this section.
(8)
A person commits an offence if the person conceals, destroys, distorts or alters, or arranges for the concealment, destruction, distortion or alteration of anything required, or which there are reasonable grounds for believing might be required, to be provided to the panel by a notice under this section.
(9)
A person who is guilty of an offence under subsection (7) or (8) is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale or both.

an amount not exceeding £70,000 if the panel is satisfied that an additional amount is justified by the severity of the matters raised by the application, and

(5)
In a case where more than one person is entitled to compensation by virtue of section 6, the proportion of the compensation to which each person is entitled is—
(a)
the proportion which that person's share of the deceased's residuary estate bears to the total of the shares of every other person entitled to the compensation, or
(b)
where the application is made by virtue of section 6(2) or the panel considers in the case of an application made by virtue of section 6(1) that the result which would be brought about under paragraph (a) of this subsection would not be in the interests of justice, such proportion as the panel considers would be in the interests of justice.
(6)
In the case of an application which relates to more than one institution, only one determination of an amount of compensation may be made under each of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (2) (or, in a case of the kind mentioned in subsection (5), only one determination under each of those paragraphs in accordance with that subsection), regardless of the number of institutions concerned.
(7)
The Board may make arrangements for facilitating access for a person who is awarded compensation under this Part to advice on the financial management of the award.

(3)
Where an order has been made under subsection (2) and the total compensation subsequently awarded on the application exceeds £10,000, the panel must order an amount equivalent to the excess to be paid as compensation.

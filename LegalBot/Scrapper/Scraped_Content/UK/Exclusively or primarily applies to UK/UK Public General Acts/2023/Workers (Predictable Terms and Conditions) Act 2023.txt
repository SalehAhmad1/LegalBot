Statutory right to request predictable work pattern
(1)
A worker may apply to the worker’s employer for a change in terms and conditions of employment if—
(a)
there is a lack of predictability, in relation to the work that the worker does for the employer, as regards any part of the worker’s work pattern,
(b)
the change relates to the worker’s work pattern, and
(c)
the worker’s purpose in applying for the change is to get a more predictable work pattern.
(But see section 80IB concerning restrictions on the making of an application.)
(2)
The work pattern of a worker is made up of—

(c)
the period for which the worker is contracted to work, and

such other aspects of the worker’s terms and conditions of employment as the Secretary of State may specify by regulations.
(3)
If a worker works under a worker’s contract with a fixed term of 12 months or less—
(a)
there is to be regarded as being a lack of predictability as regards the period for which the worker is contracted to work, and
(b)
the worker’s purpose in applying for a change to the duration of the contract is to be regarded as being to get a more predictable work pattern if the change would result in a longer fixed term or the removal of the provision in the worker’s contract restricting its duration.
(4)
An application under this section must—
(a)
state that it is such an application, and
(b)
specify the change applied for and the date on which it is proposed the change should become effective.
(5)
The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision about—

80IB
Restrictions on the making of an application under section 80IA

(3)
A worker may only make an application under section 80IA to the worker’s employer if the worker was employed by the same employer (whether or not under the same worker’s contract) at some point during the month immediately preceding such period, ending with the making of the application, as is specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State.
(4)
Section 80IA is subject to section 80IM (which restricts the right to make multiple applications under this Part).

(a)
must deal with the application in a reasonable manner,
(b)
must notify the worker of the decision on the application within the decision period, and

(iv)
detrimental impact on other aspects of the employer’s business,

(2)
Subsection (1) applies even if the worker ceases to be employed by the employer during the decision period.
(3)
In such a case—
(a)
the employer may also reject the application on the ground that—
(i)
the worker terminated the worker’s contract (with or without notice) other than in circumstances in which the worker was entitled to terminate it without notice by reason of the employer’s conduct;
(ii)
the employer terminated the worker’s contract (with or without notice) and the employer’s reason for doing so (or, if more than one, the employer’s principal reason for doing so) is a qualifying reason and in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the employer’s undertaking) the employer acted reasonably in treating the reason (or the principal reason) as a sufficient reason for terminating the contract, and
(b)
if the employer grants the application, the employer must, before the end of the offer period, offer the worker a new worker’s contract with terms and conditions that—
(i)
taken as a whole, are not less favourable than the terms and conditions of the worker’s contract at the time the application was made, and
(ii)
reflect the change relating to the worker’s work pattern that was applied for.
(4)
In subsection (3)(a)(ii) “qualifying reason” means—
(a)
a reason that fulfils the requirement in section 98(1)(b), or
(b)
in relation to a worker who was not an employee immediately before ceasing to be employed, a reason that would fulfil the requirement in section 98(1)(b) if references in that provision and in section 98(2) and (3) to an employee were references to a worker.
(5)
Regulations under subsection (1)(c)(vii) may provide for a modified version of a specified ground to apply in cases where the worker ceases to be employed by an employer.
(6)
If an employer allows a worker to appeal a decision to reject an application, the reference in subsection (1)(b) to the decision on the application is a reference to—
(a)
the decision on the appeal, or
(b)
if more than one appeal is allowed, the decision on the final appeal.

For the purposes of subsections (1)(b), (2) and (5) the decision period applicable to a worker’s application under section 80IA is the period of one month beginning with the date on which the application is made.
(8)
For the purposes of subsection (3)(b) the offer period applicable to a worker’s application under section 80IA is the period of two weeks beginning with date on which the employer grants the application.
(9)
An application under section 80IA is to be treated as having been withdrawn by the worker if—
(a)
the worker without good reason has failed to attend both the first meeting arranged by the employer to discuss the application and the next meeting arranged for that purpose, or
(b)
where the employer allows the worker to appeal a decision to reject an application or to make a further appeal, the worker without good reason has failed to attend both the first meeting arranged by the employer to discuss the appeal and the next meeting arranged for that purpose,
and the employer has notified the worker that the employer has decided to treat that conduct of the worker as a withdrawal of the application.
(10)
“Work pattern” has the same meaning in this section as in section 80IA (see section 80IA(2)).
80ID

(1)
A worker who makes an application under section 80IA may present a complaint to an employment tribunal—
(a)
that the worker’s employer has failed in relation to the application to comply with section 80IC(1) (as read, where applicable, with section 80IC(3)(a)),
(b)
that the worker’s employer has failed, having granted the application, to comply with section 80IC(3)(b),
(c)

(b)
no complaint under subsection (1)(b) may be made until—
(i)
the employer offers the worker a new worker’s contract, or
(ii)
if the offer period applicable to the application (see section 80IC(8)) comes to an end without the employer offering the worker a new worker’s contract, the end of the offer period.
(4)
If an employer allows a worker to appeal a decision to reject an application, subsection (3)(a) applies as if the references to the employer notifying the worker of the employer’s decision on the application were references to the employer notifying the worker of the employer’s decision on the appeal or, if more than one appeal is allowed, the decision on the final appeal.

An employment tribunal may not consider a complaint under this section unless it is presented—
(a)
before the end of the period of three months beginning with the relevant date, or
(b)
within such further period as the tribunal considers reasonable in a case where it is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable for the complaint to be presented before the end of that period of three months.
(7)
In subsection (6)(a), the reference to the relevant date is a reference to the first date on which the worker may make a complaint under subsection (1)(a), (b), (c) or (d) (as the case may be).

(2)
Where an employment tribunal makes an order under subsection (1)(a), section 80IC is to apply as if the application had been made on the date of the order.

(1)
An agency worker may apply to a temporary work agency with which the agency worker has a contract to perform work or services personally (whether or not a contract of employment) for a change in the terms and conditions of the contract if—
(a)
there is a lack of predictability, in relation to the work that the agency worker is supplied by the temporary work agency to do for a particular hirer, as regards any part of the agency worker’s work pattern,
(b)
the change relates to the agency worker’s work pattern, and
(c)
the agency worker’s purpose in applying for the change is to get a more predictable work pattern.
(But see section 80IG concerning restrictions on the making of an application.)
(2)
An agency worker may apply to a hirer under whose supervision and direction the agency worker is working for the hirer to enter into a contract of employment or other worker’s contract with the agency worker if—
(a)
there is a lack of predictability, in relation to the work that the agency worker does for the hirer, as regards any part of the agency worker’s work pattern,
(b)
the change relates to the agency worker’s work pattern, and
(c)
the agency worker’s purpose in applying for the change is to get a more predictable work pattern.
(But see section 80IG concerning restrictions on the making of an application.)
(3)
For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), in relation to the work done by the agency worker for a particular hirer, the work pattern of the agency worker is made up of—
(a)
the number of hours that the agency worker works,
(b)
the days of the week on which, and the times on those days when, the agency worker works,
(c)
the period for which the agency worker is supplied to work, and
(d)
such other aspects of the agency worker’s terms and conditions of work as the Secretary of State may specify by regulations.
(4)
If an agency worker’s contract with a temporary work agency provides for the agency worker to be supplied to work for a particular hirer for a period of 12 months or less—
(a)
there is to be regarded as being a lack of predictability as regards the period for which the agency worker is supplied to work, and
(b)
the agency worker’s purpose in applying to the temporary work agency for a change to the duration of the contract is to be regarded as being to get a more predictable work pattern if the change would result in the contract providing for the agency worker to be supplied to work for that hirer for a period of more than 12 months beginning with the date of the change.
(5)
An application under this section must state that it is such an application and—
(a)
in the case of an application to a temporary work agency—

(ii)
specify the date on which it is proposed the agency worker should start work under the worker’s contract.
(6)

(a)
for the agency worker to do the same or broadly similar work to the work that the agency worker does for the hirer;
(b)
the relevant terms and conditions of which, taken as a whole, are not less favourable than the relevant terms and conditions (if any) that, at the time the application is made—
(i)
are ordinarily included in the contracts of employees of the hirer doing the same or broadly similar work to the work that the agency worker does for the hirer, having regard, where relevant, to whether they have a similar level of qualification and skills, or
(ii)
would be ordinarily included in such contracts if the employer had any such employees.
(7)
An application to a hirer for a worker’s contract other than a contract of employment is to be treated as an application for a contract—
(a)
for the agency worker to do the same or broadly similar work to the work that the agency worker does for the hirer;
(b)
the relevant terms and conditions of which, taken as a whole, are not less favourable than the relevant terms and conditions (if any) that, at the time the application is made—
(i)
are ordinarily included in the contracts of workers of the hirer who are not employees and who are doing the same or broadly similar work to the work that the agency worker does for the hirer, having regard, where relevant, to whether they have a similar level of qualification and skills, or
(ii)
would be ordinarily included in such contracts if the employer had any such workers.
(8)
The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision about—
(a)
the form of applications under this section, and
(b)
when such an application is to be taken to be made.

(2)
An agency worker may only make an application under section 80IF to a hirer if—
(a)
during such period, ending with the making of the application, as is specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State the agency worker worked in the same role with the same hirer for at least 12 continuous calendar weeks during one or more assignments, and
(b)
the role that the agency worker had during those 12 continuous calendar weeks is the same role in which the agency worker is working for the hirer at the time the application is made.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2)—
(a)
whether or not an agency worker worked or works in the same role is to be determined in accordance with regulation 7(3) of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/93);
(b)
whether or not an agency worker has worked for at least 12 continuous calendar weeks is to be determined in accordance with regulation 7(4) to (11) of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 (and, accordingly, “week” has the same meaning as it has in those provisions of those Regulations).
(4)
Section 80IF is subject to section 80IM (which restricts the right to make multiple applications under this Part).
(5)
Regulations under this section may make different provision for different cases.

(b)
where the temporary work agency or the hirer (as the case may be) allows the agency worker to appeal a decision to reject an application or to make a further appeal, the agency worker without good reason has failed to attend both the first meeting arranged by the temporary work agency or the hirer to discuss the appeal and the next meeting arranged for that purpose,

(i)
the agency worker terminated the contract (with or without notice) other than in circumstances in which the agency worker was entitled to terminate it without notice by reason of the temporary work agency’s conduct;
(ii)
the temporary work agency terminated the contract (with or without notice) and the temporary work agency’s reason for doing so (or, if more than one, the temporary work agency’s principal reason for doing so) is a qualifying reason and in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the temporary work agency’s undertaking) the temporary work agency acted reasonably in treating the reason (or the principal reason) as a sufficient reason for terminating the contract, and
(b)
if the temporary work agency grants the application, the temporary work agency must, before the end of the offer period, offer the agency worker a new contract with terms and conditions that—
(i)
taken as a whole, are not less favourable than the terms and conditions of the contract that the agency worker had with the temporary work agency at the time the application was made, and
(ii)
reflect the change relating to the agency worker’s work pattern that was applied for.
(3)
In subsection (2)(a)(ii) “qualifying reason” means a reason falling within subsection (4) or some other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify the termination of the contract of an agency worker doing work of the kind which the agency worker was supplied by the temporary work agency to do.

(5)
In a case falling within subsection (1)(b), the hirer may also reject the application on the ground that—

the agency worker declined to continue working under the supervision and direction of the hirer other than in circumstances in which the agency worker was entitled to do so without notice by reason of the hirer’s conduct;
(b)
the hirer told the temporary work agency, in accordance with the arrangements between them, to stop supplying the agency worker and the hirer’s reason for doing so (or, if more than one, the hirer’s principal reason for doing so) is a qualifying reason and in the circumstances (including the size and administrative resources of the hirer’s undertaking) the hirer acted reasonably in treating the reason (or the principal reason) as a sufficient reason for telling the temporary work agency to stop supplying the agency worker.
(6)
In subsection (5)(b) “qualifying reason” means a reason falling within subsection (7) or some other substantial reason of a kind such as to justify telling a temporary work agency to stop supplying an agency worker doing work of the kind which the agency worker was supplied to the hirer to do.

(b)
that the temporary work agency has failed, having granted the application, to comply with section 80II(2)(b),

no complaint under subsection (1)(a) or (c) may be made until—
(i)
the temporary work agency or the hirer (as the case may be) notifies the agency worker of the decision on the application, or

make an order for reconsideration of the application, and
(b)
make an award of compensation to be paid by the temporary work agency or the hirer (as the case may be) to the agency worker.

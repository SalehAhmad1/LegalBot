Sch. 2 para. 13 in force at 26.12.2023, see s. 334(3)(a)Orders for securing compliance with certain provisions
1
(1)
Where the economic regulator is satisfied that a licence holder is contravening, or is likely to contravene, any relevant condition or requirement, the economic regulator must make an order (a “final order”) containing such provision as appears to the economic regulator to be necessary for the purpose of securing compliance with that condition or requirement (but this sub-paragraph does not apply if the economic regulator is required by sub-paragraph (2) to make a provisional order in respect of the contravention or likely contravention).
(2)
Where it appears to the economic regulator—
(a)
that a licence holder is contravening, or is likely to contravene, any relevant condition or requirement, and
(b)
that it is appropriate to make an order under this sub-paragraph,
the economic regulator must (instead of taking steps towards the making of a final order) make an order (a “provisional order”) containing such provision as appears to the economic regulator to be necessary for the purpose of securing compliance with that condition or requirement.
(3)
In determining for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2)(b) whether it is appropriate to make a provisional order, the economic regulator must have regard, in particular, to the extent to which any person is likely to sustain loss or damage in consequence of anything that is likely to be done (or omitted to be done) in contravention of the relevant condition or requirement before a final order may be made.
(4)
The economic regulator must confirm a provisional order, with or without modifications, if—
(a)
the economic regulator is satisfied that the licence holder is contravening, or is likely to contravene, any relevant condition or requirement, and
(b)
the provision made by the order (with any modifications) is necessary for the purpose of securing compliance with that condition or requirement.
(5)
If a provisional order is not previously confirmed under sub-paragraph (4), it is to cease to have effect at the end of such period (not exceeding three months) as is determined by or under the order.
(6)
Sub-paragraphs (1) to (4) are subject to sub-paragraphs (7) to (9) and paragraph 2.
(7)
The economic regulator—
(a)
must, before making a final order or making or confirming a provisional order, consider whether it would be more appropriate to proceed under the Competition Act 1998 (see section 37);
(b)
must not make a final order, or make or confirm a provisional order, if the economic regulator considers that it would be more appropriate to proceed under that Act.
(8)
The economic regulator may not make a final order or make or confirm a provisional order if the economic regulator is satisfied that the duties imposed on the economic regulator by section 1 preclude the making or, as the case may be, the confirmation of the order.
(9)
The economic regulator is not required to make a final order or make or confirm a provisional order if it is satisfied—
(a)
that the licence holder has agreed to take and is taking all such steps as appear to the economic regulator to be for the time being appropriate for the purpose of securing or facilitating compliance with the condition or requirement in question, or
(b)
that the contraventions were, or the apprehended contraventions are, of a trivial nature.
(10)
Where the economic regulator decides that it would be more appropriate to proceed under the Competition Act 1998 or is satisfied as mentioned in sub-paragraphs (8) and (9), the economic regulator must—
(a)
give notice to the licence holder that the economic regulator has so decided or is so satisfied, and
(b)
publish a copy of the notice in such manner as the economic regulator considers appropriate for the purpose of bringing the matters to which the notice relates to the attention of persons likely to be affected by them.
(11)
A final or provisional order—
(a)
must require the licence holder (according to the circumstances of the case) to do, or not to do, such things as are specified in the order or are of a description so specified,
(b)
must take effect at such time as is determined by or under the order, which must be the earliest practicable time, and
(c)
may be revoked at any time by the economic regulator.
(12)
In this Schedule—
“final order” means an order under sub-paragraph (1);
“provisional order” means an order under sub-paragraph (2);

a trustee of a settlement (as defined in section 620 of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005) of which the person is a beneficiary.
Revocation of licence re change in control
7
(1)
This paragraph applies in connection with a change in control of a licence holder which is a company (see paragraph 6).
(2)
In the event of—

any breach or non-observance by the company of any of the terms of paragraph 6,
(b)
any breach of a condition (imposed in accordance with paragraph 6) subject to which the authority gave its consent to a change in control of the company, or
(c)
any failure to provide full and accurate information in response to a notice given by the authority to the company under section 29A,
the authority may, by giving the company and any joint licence holders notice in writing, revoke the licence with effect from the date specified in the notice.
Partial revocation of licence re change in control
8
(1)
This paragraph applies if two or more persons are joint licence holders and any of them is a company.
(2)
If an event mentioned in paragraph 7(2)(a), (b) or (c) occurs in connection with a change in control of the company, the authority may exercise the power in paragraph 7 to revoke the licence in so far as it applies to that company (without revoking it in so far as it applies to the other person or persons who are joint licence holders).”Section 113

68A
Relevant merger situations involving energy network mergers
(1)
For the purposes of this Part, a relevant merger situation involves an energy network merger if two or more of the enterprises that cease to be distinct are energy network enterprises of the same type.

For the purposes of this Part, the types of “energy network enterprise” are—
(a)
an enterprise holding a licence under section 7 of the Gas Act 1986 (gas transporter);
(b)
an enterprise holding a licence under section 6(1)(b) of the Electricity Act 1989 (transmission of electricity), except as mentioned in subsection (3);
(c)
an enterprise holding a licence under section 6(1)(c) of the Electricity Act 1989 (distribution of electricity), except as mentioned in subsection (3).
(3)
An enterprise holding a licence under section 6(1)(b) or (c) of the Electricity Act 1989 is not an energy network enterprise if—
(a)
the licence was granted following a tender exercise, and
(b)
either—
(i)
the enterprise does not hold any other licence of a type mentioned in subsection (2), or
(ii)
the enterprise holds one or more other licences under section 6(1)(b) or (c) of the Electricity Act 1989 and each of those other licences was granted following a tender exercise.
(4)
The Secretary of State may by regulations amend this section by—
(a)
adding to subsection (2) an enterprise holding a licence under the Gas Act 1986 or the Electricity Act 1989 of a type that is not specified in that subsection;

a relevant merger situation involving an energy network merger has been created, and
(b)
the creation of that situation has caused, or may be expected to cause, substantial prejudice to the ability of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, in carrying out its functions under Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986 or Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989, to make comparisons between energy network enterprises of the type involved in the energy network merger;
but this is subject to subsections (2) and (3).

(a)
arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which, if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger situation involving an energy network merger, and
(b)
the creation of that situation may be expected to cause substantial prejudice to the ability of the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority, in carrying out its functions under Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986 or Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989, to make comparisons between energy network enterprises of the type involved in the energy network merger,
but this is subject to subsections (2) and (3).
(2)
The CMA may decide not to make a reference under this section if it believes that—
(a)
the arrangements concerned are not sufficiently far advanced, or are not sufficiently likely to proceed, to justify the making of a reference, or
(b)
any relevant customer benefits in relation to the creation of the relevant merger situation concerned outweigh the prejudice mentioned in subsection (1)(b).
(3)
The CMA must not make a reference under this section in any circumstances described in section 33(3).

(b)
consider that opinion.
(2)
Where the CMA makes a request under this section, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority must give its opinion on—

whether and to what extent the creation of the relevant merger situation has prejudiced, or may be expected to prejudice, the Authority’s ability, in carrying out its functions under Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986 or Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989, to make comparisons between energy network enterprises of the type involved in the relevant merger situation, and
(b)
whether any prejudice is outweighed by any relevant customer benefits in relation to the creation of the relevant merger situation.
(3)
The Gas and Electricity Markets Authority must prepare and publish a statement of the methods it considers should be applied in forming an opinion on the matters mentioned in subsection (2).
(4)
The statement must, in particular, set out—
(a)
the criteria to be used for assessing the effect of any particular energy network enterprises ceasing to be distinct enterprises on the Gas and Electricity Market Authority’s ability to make comparisons between such enterprises, and
(b)
the relative weight to be given to the criteria.

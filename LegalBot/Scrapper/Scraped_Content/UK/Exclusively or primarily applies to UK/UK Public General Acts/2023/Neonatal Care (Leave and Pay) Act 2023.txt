“Unfair neonatal care leave provisions
5E
(1)
Where an employment-related benefit scheme includes any unfair neonatal care leave provisions (irrespective of any differences on the basis of sex in the treatment accorded to members under those provisions), then—

the scheme is to be regarded to that extent as not complying with the principle of equal treatment; and
(b)

(b)
which requires the amount of any benefit payable under the scheme to or in respect of any such member, to the extent that it falls to be determined by reference to earnings during a period which included a period of paid neonatal care leave, to be determined otherwise than in accordance with the normal employment requirement.
(3)

(a)
the more favourable treatment required by paragraph 3(1) is treatment no less favourable than would be accorded to the member in accordance with the normal employment requirement; and
(b)
paragraph 3(2) does not authorise the making of any such election as is there mentioned;
but, in respect of any period of paid neonatal care leave, a member is only required to pay contributions on the amount of contractual remuneration or statutory neonatal care pay actually paid to or for the member in respect of that period.
(4)
In this paragraph—
“the normal employment requirement” is the requirement that any period of paid neonatal care leave is to be treated as if it were a period throughout which the member in question works normally and receives the remuneration likely to be paid for doing so;

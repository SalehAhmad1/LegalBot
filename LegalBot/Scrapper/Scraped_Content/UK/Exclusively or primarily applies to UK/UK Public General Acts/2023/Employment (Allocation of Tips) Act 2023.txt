(a)
of a fixed value expressed in monetary terms, and
(b)
capable of being exchanged (whether on its own or together with other vouchers, stamps, tokens or items, and whether immediately or only after a time) for money, goods or services (or for any combination of two or more of those things).

A reimbursement provision is “prohibited” if there is a relationship between—
(a)
the payment or reduction, or the amount of the payment or reduction, under the reimbursement provision, and
(b)
either—
(i)
the worker being allocated qualifying tips, gratuities and service charges, or
(ii)
the worker receiving worker-received tips that are not qualifying tips, gratuities and service charges.
(4)
The circumstances in which there is a relationship of the kind mentioned in subsection (3) include circumstances where—
(a)
the possibility of the worker being allocated qualifying tips, gratuities and service charges,
(b)
the amount of qualifying tips, gratuities and service charges to be allocated to the worker,
(c)
the possibility of the worker receiving worker-received tips that are not qualifying tips, gratuities and service charges, or
(d)
the amount of worker-received tips that are not qualifying tips, gratuities and service charges to be received by the worker,

27X
Interpretation
(1)
In this Part—
“customer”, in relation to an employer, includes any person who is provided with services by the employer;
“place of business”, in relation to an employer, includes any location where the activities of the employer’s business are carried out (whether on a permanent or temporary basis).
(2)
Where a qualifying tip, gratuity or service charge is—
(a)
attributable to a place of business, but
(b)
paid at a different place of business,
this Part applies to the qualifying tip, gratuity or service charge only in relation to the place of business to which it is attributable.
(3)
Where an employer-received tip or a worker-received tip is neither paid at, nor otherwise attributable to, a place of business of the employer, this Part applies as if—
(a)
the tip were attributable to a place of business of the employer, and
(b)
all workers of the employer were at that place of business (whether or not those workers were also at any other place of business of the employer).
(4)
Where subsection (3) applies in relation to two or more employer-received tips or worker-received tips, all such tips are attributable (in accordance with that subsection) to the same place of business of the employer.
(5)
For the purposes of this Part an employer and a person are to be treated as associated if—
(a)
one is a company of which the other (directly or indirectly) has control, or
(b)
both are companies of which a third person (directly or indirectly) has control,
and “associated person” is to be construed accordingly.
27Y
Application
This Part applies in respect of tips, gratuities and service charges paid by customers on or after the date on which section 27D comes into force.”

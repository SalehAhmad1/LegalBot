of that Act. 
The Secretary of State has—

Citation and commencement 
1. This Order may be cited as the East of Start Point Marine Conservation Zone Designation 
Order 2019 and comes into force on 31st May 2019. 
Interpretation 
2.—(1) In this Order— 
“protected feature”, in relation to the Zone, has the meaning given by article 4; 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 2009 c. 23. See section 116(5) for the definition of “appropriate authority”. 
 
2 
“the Zone” means the area designated by article 3(1) as a marine conservation zone. 
(2) In this Order, references to “co-ordinates” are references to co-ordinates of latitude and 
longitude according to the World Geodetic System 1984(a). 
Area designated 
3.—(1) The area described in paragraph (2) is designated as a marine conservation zone. 
(2) The area is the marine area enclosed by the four boundary lines which are described in the 
Schedule, in each case by reference to— 
(a) the co-ordinates of the points joined by the line, and 
(b) a topographical description of the line. 
(3) In paragraph (2), “marine area”, in relation to the area designated, means— 
(a) any area of seabed or other land (whether or not covered by water) within that area, and 
(b) all of the water covering any part of that seabed or other land. 
(4) The Zone may be referred to as “the East of Start Point Marine Conservation Zone”. 
Protected feature 
4. The marine habitat which is the protected feature of the Zone is subtidal sand. 
Conservation objective 
5.—(1) The conservation objective of the Zone is that the protected feature— 
(a) so far as already in favourable condition, remain in such condition, and 
(b) so far as not already in favourable condition, be brought into such condition, and remain 
in such condition. 
(2) In paragraph (1), “favourable condition”, with respect to the protected feature within the 
Zone, means that— 
(a) its extent is stable or increasing, and 
(b) its structure and functions, its quality, and the composition of its characteristic biological 
communities are such to ensure that it remains in a condition which is healthy and not 
deteriorating. 
(3) In paragraph (2)(b), the reference to the composition of the characteristic biological 
communities of the protected feature includes a reference to the diversity and abundance of 
species forming part of, or inhabiting, the protected feature. 
(4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), any temporary deterioration in condition is to be 
disregarded if the protected feature is sufficiently healthy and resilient to enable its recovery. 
(5) For the purpose of determining whether a protected feature is in favourable condition within 
the meaning of paragraph (2), any alteration to that feature brought about entirely by natural 
processes is to be disregarded.

116(1), and in accordance with sections 117(1), (2) and (7), 118(1) and (6), and 123(1), of the 
Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009(a). 
The Secretary of State thinks it desirable to make this Order for the purpose of conserving the 
species of marine fauna specified in article 4 of this Order. 
The Secretary of State has had regard to any obligations under EU or international law that relate 
to the conservation or improvement of the marine environment in accordance with section 123(5) 
of that Act. 
The Secretary of State has— 
(a) published notice of the proposal to make this Order in accordance with section 119(2) and 
(3) of that Act, and 
(b) consulted persons who the Secretary of State thinks are likely to be interested in, or 
affected by, the making of this Order in accordance with section 119(4) of that Act. 
Citation and commencement 
1. This Order may be cited as the Berwick to St. Mary’s Marine Conservation Zone Designation 
Order 2019 and comes into force on 31st May 2019. 
Interpretation 
2.—(1) In this Order— 
“protected feature”, in relation to the Zone, has the meaning given by article 4; 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 2009 c. 23. See section 116(5) for the definition of “appropriate authority”. 
 
2 
“the Zone” means the area designated by article 3(1) as a marine conservation zone. 
(2) In this Order, references to “co-ordinates” are references to co-ordinates of latitude and 
longitude according to the World Geodetic System 1984(a). 
Area designated 
3.—(1) The area described in paragraph (2) is designated as a marine conservation zone. 
(2) The area is the marine area enclosed by the thirty eight boundary lines which are described 
in the Schedule, in each case by reference to— 
(a) the co-ordinates of the points joined by the line, and 
(b) a topographical description of the line. 
(3) In paragraph (2), “marine area”, in relation to the area designated, means— 
(a) any area of seabed or other land (whether or not covered by water) within that area, and 
(b) all of the water covering any part of that seabed or other land. 
(4) The Zone may be referred to as “the Berwick to St Mary’s Marine Conservation Zone”. 
Protected feature 
4. The species of marine fauna which is the protected feature of the Zone is common eider 
(Somateria mollissima). 
Conservation objectives 
5.—(1) The conservation objectives of the Zone are that, in relation to common eider (Somateria 
mollissima)— 
(a) the habitat used by members of that species (“supporting habitat”)— 
(i) so far as already in favourable condition, remain in such condition, and 
(ii) so far as not already in favourable condition, be brought into such condition and 
remain in such condition; 
(b) the population of that species— 
(i) so far as already in favourable condition, remain in such condition, and 
(ii) so far as not already in favourable condition, be brought into such condition, and 
remain in such condition. 
(2) In paragraph (1), “favourable condition”— 
(a) with respect to supporting habitat within the Zone, means that— 
(i) its extent and distribution is stable or increasing, and 
(ii) its structures and functions, its quality, and the composition of its characteristic 
biological communities are such as to ensure that it remains in a condition which is 
healthy and not deteriorating; 
(b) with respect to the population of that species occurring within the Zone (whether 
temporary or otherwise), means that the distribution, size, age and sex ratios of the 
population are such as to ensure that it is maintained in numbers which enable it to thrive. 
(3) In paragraph 2(a)(ii), the reference to the composition of the characteristic biological 
communities of a habitat includes a reference to the diversity and abundance of species forming 
part of, or inhabiting, that habitat. 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) The World Geodetic System 1984 (“WGS 84”) defines a reference frame for the earth, for use in geodesy and navigation. It 
was developed by the United States’ National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and is maintained by it. WGS 84 is defined at 
paragraph 2.1 of the United States’ National Imagery and Mapping Agency Technical Report TR8350.2, third edition, 
amendment 1 of 3rd January 2000 entitled “Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1984” (http://earth-
info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf). 
 
3 
(4) For the purpose of determining whether the protected feature is in a favourable condition 
within the meaning of paragraph (2), any alteration to that feature brought about entirely by 
natural processes is to be disregarded.

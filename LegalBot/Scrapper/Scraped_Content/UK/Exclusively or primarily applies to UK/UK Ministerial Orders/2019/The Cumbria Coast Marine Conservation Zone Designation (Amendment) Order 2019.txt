(a) in the definition of “co-ordinate” omit “and”; 
(b) for the definition of “the Zone”, substitute— 
“Zone 1” means the area designated by article 3(1) as a marine conservation zone; and 
“Zone 2” means the area designated by article 3(2A) as a marine conservation zone. 
(3) In article 3 (area designated)— 
(a) in the heading, for “Area” substitute “Areas”; 
(b) in paragraph (1), after “zone” insert “and may be referred to as “Zone 1 of the Cumbria 
Coast Marine Conservation Zone””; 
(c) in paragraph (2), after “described in” insert “Table 1 of”; 
(d) after paragraph (2), insert— 
“(2A) The area described in paragraph (2B) is designated as a marine conservation zone 
and may be referred to as “Zone 2 of the Cumbria Coast Marine Conservation Zone”. 
(2B) The area is the marine area enclosed by the fourteen boundary lines which are 
described in Table 2 of Schedule 1, in each case by reference to— 
(a) the co-ordinates of the points joined by the line; and 
(b) a topographical description of the line.”; 
(e) in paragraph (3), for “paragraph (2)” substitute “paragraphs (2) and (2B)”; and 
(f) in paragraph (4), for “The Zone” substitute “Together Zones 1 and 2”. 
(4) In article 4—

(i) for “the Zone” substitute “Zone 1”; and 
(ii) after “(“the habitats”)” insert “and razorbill (Alca torda)”;

(d) in paragraph (3) for “the Zone” substitute “Zone 1”; 
(e) after paragraph (6) insert— 
“(7) The conservation objective for razorbill in Zone 1 is the same as the conservation 
objective for razorbill in Zone 2, as specified in article 5 but as if references to Zone 2 were 
references to Zone 1.”. 
(5) After article 4 insert— 
“Protected feature and conservation objective of Zone 2 
5.—(1) The protected feature for Zone 2 is razorbill (Alca torda). 
(2) The conservation objective in relation to razorbill in Zone 2 is that— 
(a) the habitat used by members of that species (“supporting habitat”)— 
 
(i) so far as in favourable condition, remain in such condition, and

(ii) so far as not already in favourable condition, be brought into such condition 
and remain in such condition; 
(b) the population of breeding razorbill— 
 
(i) so far as in favourable condition, remain in such condition, and  
 
(ii) so far as not already in favourable condition, be brought into such condition, 
and remain in such condition. 
(3) In paragraph (2), “favourable condition”— 
(a) with respect to supporting habitat within Zone 2, means that— 
 
(i) its extent and distribution is stable or increasing; 
 
(ii) its structures and functions, its quality, and the composition of its 
characteristic biological communities are such as to ensure that it remains in a 
condition which is healthy and not deteriorating; 
(b) with respect to the population of breeding razorbill occurring within Zone 2 
(whether temporary or otherwise), means that the distribution, size, age and sex 
ratios of the population are such as to ensure that it is maintained in numbers 
which enable it to thrive. 
(4) For the purpose of determining whether a protected feature is in favourable condition 
within the meaning of paragraph (2), any alteration to that feature brought about entirely by 
natural processes is to be disregarded.” 
(6) In Schedule 1— 
(a) In the heading, for “Area” substitute “Areas”; 
(b) before the table, insert— 
“Table 1 – Zone 1”; 
(c) in the list of boundary point co-ordinates, for the entries for boundary points “A” and “B” 
substitute— 
““A” is 54° 32 24.579 N and 03° 36 11.132 W;

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Order) 
This Order amends the Cumbria Coast Marine Conservation Zone Designation Order 2013 
(Ministerial Order 2013 No. 6) to amend the boundary of the Cumbria Coast Marine Conservation 
Zone designated in 2013 and to designate as a marine conservation zone an area contiguous to that 
zone.  Together, the two zones may be referred to as the Cumbria Coast Marine Conservation 
Zone.  The Order adds razorbill (Alca torda) which is a species of marine fauna as a protected 
feature in the Cumbria Coast Marine Conservation Zone.  The conservation objectives of the 
Cumbria Coast Marine Conservation Zone are set out in the Order, as amended, in article 4 and 
new article 5. 
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business and 
the voluntary sector is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/marine-

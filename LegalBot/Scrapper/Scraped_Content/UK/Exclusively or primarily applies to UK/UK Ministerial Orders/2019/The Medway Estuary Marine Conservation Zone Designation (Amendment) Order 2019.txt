EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Order) 
This Order amends the Medway Estuary Marine Conservation Zone Designation Order 2013 
(Ministerial Order 2013 No. 14) to designate as a marine conservation zone an area contiguous to 
the Medway Estuary Marine Conservation Zone designated in 2013. Together the two zones may 
be referred to as the Medway Estuary Marine Conservation Zone. The Order adds smelt (Osmerus 
eperlanus), which is a species of marine fauna, as a protected feature in the Medway Estuary 
Marine Conservation Zone. The conservation objectives of the Medway Estuary Marine 
Conservation Zone are set out in the Order, as amended, in article 5 and new article 6.

The Secretary of State makes the following Order in exercise of the power conferred by section 
116(1), and in accordance with sections 117(1), (2) and (7), 118(1) and (6), and 123(1), of the 
Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009(a). 
The Secretary of State thinks it desirable to make this Order for the purpose of conserving the 
marine habitats and the species of marine fauna and flora specified in Schedule 2 to this Order. 
The Secretary of State has had regard to any obligations under EU or international law that relate 
to the conservation or improvement of the marine environment in accordance with section 123(5) 
of that Act. 
The Secretary of State has— 
(a) published notice of the proposal to make this Order in accordance with section 119(2) and 
(3) of that Act, and 
(b) consulted persons who the Secretary of State thinks are likely to be interested in, or 
affected by, the making of this Order in accordance with section 119(4) of that Act. 
Citation and commencement 
1. This Order may be cited as the Purbeck Coast Marine Conservation Zone Designation Order 
2019 and comes into force on 31st May 2019. 
Interpretation 
2.—(1) In this Order— 
“protected feature”, in relation to the Zone, has the meaning given by article 4; 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 2009 c. 23. See section 116(5) for the definition of “appropriate authority”. 
 
2 
“the Zone” means the area designated by article 3(1) as a marine conservation zone. 
(2) In this Order, references to “co-ordinates” are references to co-ordinates of latitude and 
longitude according to the World Geodetic System 1984(a). 
Area designated 
3.—(1) The area described in paragraph (2) is designated as a marine conservation zone. 
(2) The area is the marine area enclosed by the eighteen boundary lines which are described in 
Schedule 1, in each case by reference to— 
(a) the co-ordinates of the points joined by the line, and 
(b) a topographical description of the line. 
(3) In paragraph (2), “marine area”, in relation to the area designated, means— 
(a) any area of seabed or other land (whether or not covered by water) within that area, and 
(b) all of the water covering any part of that seabed or other land. 
(4) The Zone may be referred to as “the Purbeck Coast Marine Conservation Zone”. 
Protected features 
4. The protected features of the Zone are specified in Schedule 2. 
Conservation objectives 
5.—(1) The first conservation objective of the Zone is that the protected features in Table 1 of 
Schedule 2— 
(a) so far as already in favourable condition, remain in such condition, and 
(b) so far as not already in favourable condition, be brought into such condition, and remain 
in such condition. 
(2) In paragraph (1), “favourable condition”— 
(a) with respect to a habitat within the Zone, means that— 
(i) its extent is stable or increasing, and 
(ii) its structure and functions, its quality, and the composition of its characteristic 
biological communities are such as to ensure that it remains in a condition which is 
healthy and not deteriorating; 
(b) with respect to a species of marine fauna or flora within the Zone, means that the quality 
and quantity of its habitat and the composition of its population in terms of number, age 
and sex ratio are such as to ensure that the population is maintained in numbers which 
enable it to thrive. 
(3) In paragraph (2)(a)(ii), the reference to the composition of the characteristic biological 
communities of a habitat includes a reference to the diversity and abundance of species forming 
part of, or inhabiting, that habitat. 
(4) For the purposes of paragraphs (2)(a)(ii), any temporary deterioration in condition is to be 
disregarded if the habitat is sufficiently healthy and resilient to enable its recovery. 
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(b), any temporary reduction of numbers is to be 
disregarded if the population is sufficiently thriving and resilient to enable its recovery. 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) The World Geodetic System 1984 (“WGS 84”) defines a reference frame for the earth, for use in geodesy and navigation. It 
was developed by the United States’ National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and is maintained by it. WGS 84 is defined at 
paragraph 2.1 of the United States’ National Imagery and Mapping Agency Technical Report TR8350.2, third edition, 
amendment 1 of 3rd January 2000 entitled “Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1984” 
(http://earthinfo.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf). 
 
3 
(6) The second conservation objective of the Zone is that, in relation to the protected feature in 
Table 2 of Schedule 2 (black seabream)— 
(a) the habitat used by members of that species for the purposes of spawning (“spawning 
habitat”)— 
(i) so far as already in favourable condition, remain in such condition, and 
(ii) so far as not already in favourable condition, be brought into such condition, and 
remain in such condition, and 
(b) the population (whether temporary or otherwise) of that species occurring in the Zone be 
free of disturbance of a kind likely significantly to affect the survival of its members or 
their ability to aggregate, nest, or lay, fertilise or guard eggs during breeding. 
(7) In paragraph (6)(a), “favourable condition” with respect to spawning habitat within the Zone, 
means that the habitat is of sufficient quality and quantity to enable members of the species using 
the habitat to survive, aggregate, nest or lay, fertilise or guard eggs during breeding. 
(8) For the purpose of determining whether a protected feature is in favourable condition within 
the meaning of paragraph (2) or (6)(a), any alteration to that feature brought about entirely by 
natural processes is to be disregarded.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Order) 
This Order designates the institution of Writtle College from 29th February 2024 at 12 p.m., for 
the purposes of section 28 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”). This 
(a) 1992 c. 13. Section 28(1) was amended by section 143(1)(a) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 (c. 21) and section
32(2)(a) of the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022 (c. 21).
(b) Section 89 of the 1992 Act makes provision for the way in which the power to make an order under section 28 must be 
exercised. Section 89 was amended by section 32(1) and (3) of the Skills and Post-16 Education Act 2022 (c. 21) with the 
result that the order-making power in section 28 is no longer required to be exercised by statutory instrument. 
(c) Writtle College, whose principal address is Lordship Road, Writtle, Chelmsford, Essex, CM1 3RR is an institution 
conducted by a private company limited by guarantee and registered in England and Wales with company number 
15198562 and with the name Writtle College Limited. The registered address of Writtle College Limited is Anglia Ruskin 
University, Bishop Hall Lane, Chelmsford, Essex, CM1 1SQ.

designation brings Writtle College within the further education sector as defined in section 91(3) 
of the 1992 Act. 
Writtle College is principally concerned with the provision of one or both of (a) full-time 
education suitable to the requirements of persons over compulsory school age who have not 
attained the age of 19 years; and (b) courses of further or higher education. Accordingly, the 
Secretary of State has concluded that Writtle College meets the legislative criteria for designation. 
The designation results from the transfer of further education provision from Writtle University 
College, a higher education corporation, (prior to its proposed dissolution under section 127A of 
the Education Reform Act 1988 (c. 40) at 5 p.m. on 29th February 2024) to Writtle College 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary company of Anglia Ruskin University Higher Education 
Corporation. 
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact 
on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 82(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 prohibits aerial advertising and propaganda save in such circumstances as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State. These Regulations extend the prescribed circumstances set out in the Civil Aviation (Aerial Advertising) Regulations 1995 so as to permit the use of any aeroplane for skytyping and skywriting. Both skytyping and skywriting involve the release of smoke in order to create text or symbols in the sky. Skytyping requires a group of aeroplanes flying in formation, whereas skywriting is typically undertaken by a single aeroplane.

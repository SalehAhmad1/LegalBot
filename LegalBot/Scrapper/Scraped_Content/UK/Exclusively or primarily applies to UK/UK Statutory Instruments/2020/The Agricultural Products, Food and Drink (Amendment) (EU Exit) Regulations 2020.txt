PART 2
New Articles 36a to 36d
“Article 36a
Transitional provision: relationship between trade marks and geographical indications
1.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or made during the relevant period must be refused where, if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 21(2) in relation to a category A geographical indication.
2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or made during the relevant period must be refused where:
(a)
if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 21(2) in relation to a category B geographical indication, and
(b)
after the application for the trade mark is accepted but before the trade mark is registered:
(i)
in the case of a type 2B geographical indication:
(aa)
the international agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of column 2 of row 2 of the Types Table enters into force or the bridging arrangements referred to in that column are made, and
(bb)
the entry into force of the international agreement or the making of the bridging arrangements is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered;
(ii)
in the case of any other category B geographical indication:
(aa)
the Secretary of State publishes an Article 30(5) approval notice relating to the geographical indication, and
(bb)
the Article 30(5) approval notice is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered.
3.  Where an application for a declaration of invalidity is made under the TMA (as applied by Article 36b(1) and modified by Article 36b(2)) in relation to the registration of a trade mark, the registration of the trade mark must be declared to be invalid, unless paragraph 4 applies, if:
(a)
the application to register the trade mark was pending immediately before IP completion day or made during the relevant period,
(b)
the use of the trade mark contravenes, or will, if used, contravene, Article 21(2) in relation to a category B geographical indication, and
(c)
in the case of a type 3B, 4B or 5B geographical indication, the Secretary of State publishes an Article 30(5) approval notice relating to the geographical indication on or after the day on which the trade mark application is accepted.
4.  This paragraph applies where a column 5 date applies in relation to the category A or B geographical indication and, taking account of any priority claimed in respect of an application to register the trade mark referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3(a) (as relevant) and on the basis of the information available to the registrar, it appears to the registrar that the date of filing of the trade mark application is earlier than the column 5 date that applies to the relevant geographical indication.
5.  As regards paragraphs 1 and 2, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2A, 3A or 4A geographical indication, in the case of paragraph 1, or in relation to a type 2B, 3B or 4B geographical indication, in the case of paragraph 2, where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the geographical indication provides that an application for a trade mark must be refused, regardless of when that application is made, if the trade mark, if registered, will contravene a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the geographical indication
6.  As regards paragraph 3, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2B, 3B or 4B geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the geographical indication provides that the registration of a trade mark must be invalidated if, regardless of when the application that resulted in the registration of the trade mark is made, the use of the trade mark contravenes a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the geographical indication.
7.  Where a geographical indication falls within the definition of more than one type of geographical indication in Article 4, the column 5 date to be taken into account for the purpose of paragraph 4 is the earliest of the column 5 dates for the relevant types of geographical indication.
8.  In a case of a category A or B geographical indication that is not on Great Britain’s GIs Register at the time an assessment is carried out under paragraph 1, 2 or 3, the geographical indication is to be treated, for the purpose of the assessment, as being a geographical indication protected under this Regulation in determining whether the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 21(2) in relation to that geographical indication.
9.  A trade mark that could be used in the United Kingdom under Article 36(2) of EU Regulation 2019/787 immediately before IP completion day may continue to be used in Great Britain on and after IP completion day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would contravene Article 21(2) of this Regulation in relation to a geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
10.  Nothing in this Regulation prevents a trade mark that could be renewed in the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 36(2) of EU Regulation 2019/787 immediately before IP completion day from being renewed after IP completion day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the renewed trade mark would contravene Article 21(2) in Great Britain in relation to a geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
11.  Where paragraph 9 or 10 applies to the use or renewal of a trade mark, this does not affect the use of:
(a)
a geographical indication entered on Great Britain’s GIs Register by the Secretary of State following a decision by the Secretary of State to approve an application made under Article 24;
(b)
a geographical indication entered on Great Britain’s GIs Register by the Secretary of State under Article 33(3) or Article 36c(1);

(b)
‘a category B geographical indication’ means a type 2B, 3B, 4B or 5B geographical indication;

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for an exemption to the learning and development requirements as set out in the Statutory Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage (“the Framework Document”) for schools taking part in the EYFS Reforms Early Adopters Scheme (“the Scheme”).
Regulation 2 enables the Secretary of State to direct that the learning and development requirements set out in sections 1 and 2 of the Framework Document do not apply, or apply with modifications, to schools providing early years provision who are participating in the Scheme.
Regulation 3 prescribes that only schools who have agreed to participate in the Scheme may be granted an exemption.
Regulation 4 provides that a direction may only apply for the period commencing on 1st September 2020 and ending on 31st August 2021 and that schools will only be exempt from section 1 and part of section 2 of the Framework Document.
Regulation 5 provides for the Secretary of State to impose conditions to a direction exempting a school from the learning and development requirements.
Regulation 6 amends Article 6(2)(a) of the Childcare (Exemptions from Registration) Order 2008 relating to exempt activity-based provision. This clarifies that the whole period covering the early years provision, including the activity listed under article 6(3) of the 2008 Order, must be four hours or less per day otherwise the exemption does not apply. This change takes effect from 1 October 2020.

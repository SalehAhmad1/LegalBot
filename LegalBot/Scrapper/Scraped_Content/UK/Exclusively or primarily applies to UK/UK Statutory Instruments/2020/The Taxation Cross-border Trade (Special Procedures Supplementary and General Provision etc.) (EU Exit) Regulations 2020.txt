Two of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's TreasuryEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made by the Treasury. They make provision supplementing provision made in relation to import duty by and under Part 1 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (c. 22) (“the Act”) and make provision generally for the purposes of import duty. This is an EU Exit statutory instrument.
Part 1 of the Act, and the Customs (Special Procedures and Outward Processing) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1249), make provision in relation to outward processing and special Customs procedures, other than transit. These procedures are defined in section 36 of, and Schedule 2 to, the Act.
Regulations 3 and 4 make provision in relation to circumstances in which goods declared for an inward processing procedure or a temporary admission procedure are to be treated as if they were declared for the free-circulation procedure, that declaration had been accepted and the free-circulation procedure had been discharged. The result of this treatment is that the goods are discharged from the relevant procedure and are domestic goods.
Regulation 5(2) amends Schedule 1 to the Act to provide that the entitlement to amend or withdraw a Customs declaration, without the consent of an HMRC officer, before a relevant event occurs may be limited by regulations made under paragraph 3(5) of Schedule 1.
Regulation 5(3) amends paragraph 33 of Schedule 7 to the Act so that the paragraph amends section 39 of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (c. 2) to include in subsection (1) reference to railway vehicles.
Regulation 6 modifies the effect of section 9(1)(b) of the Act where the relevant arrangements are continuity arrangements (as provided for in paragraph (3) of that regulation).
Regulation 7 makes amendments to the Customs (Records) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/113) in consequence of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1).

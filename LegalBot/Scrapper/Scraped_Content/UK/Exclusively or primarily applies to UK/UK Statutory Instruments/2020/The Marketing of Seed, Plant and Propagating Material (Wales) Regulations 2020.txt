These Regulations, which apply in relation to Wales, amend the following Regulations (“the Marketing Regulations”)—
the Marketing of Vegetable Plant Material Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/2652) (“the 1995 Regulations”),
the Marketing of Ornamental Plant Propagating Material Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/1801) (“the 1999 Regulations”),

The 1995 Regulations implement Council Directive 2008/72/EC on the marketing of vegetable propagating and planting material, other than seed (OJ No. L 205, 1.8.2008, p. 28) (“Council Directive 2008/72/EC”) and Commission Directive 93/61/EEC setting out the schedules indicating the conditions to be met by vegetable propagating and planting material, other than seed pursuant to Directive 92/33/EEC (OJ No. L 250, 7.10.1993, p. 19).
The 1999 Regulations implement Council Directive 98/56/EC on the marketing of propagating material of ornamental plants (OJ No. L 226, 13.8.1998, p. 16) and Commission Directive 93/49/EEC setting out the schedule indicating the conditions to be met by ornamental plant propagating material and ornamental plants pursuant to Council Directive 91/682/EEC (OJ No. L 250, 7.10.1993, p. 9).

The Secretary of State makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 45C(1), (3)(c), (4)(b), 45F(2) and 45P of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984(1).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/684) (“the Principal Regulations”) to impose restrictions on the holding of gatherings, both inside and outside, of more than 30 people (new regulations 5A and 5B of the Principal Regulations).
The Principal Regulations are also amended so that it is an offence to contravene, without reasonable excuse, any of these restrictions, and to enable an authorised person to issue a fixed penalty notice of £10,000 to any person aged 18 or over whom they reasonably believe has committed an offence of contravening these restrictions.
These Regulations also make related consequential amendments (see regulations 3 to 6 of these Regulations).
These Regulations also make minor (but unrelated) amendments to regulation 5 of the Principal Regulations and regulation 7 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/822).
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

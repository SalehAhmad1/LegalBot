(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 (S.R. 2000/347) (“the Flags Regulations”) make provision as to the flying of flags at government buildings in Northern Ireland, in particular on which buildings and on which days flags must be flown. These Regulations amend the Flags Regulations so as to remove the requirement that the Union flag is flown at Churchill House, Victoria Square, Belfast (as this building has been demolished) and to require it to be flown at Causeway Exchange, 1-7 Bedford Street, Belfast and Clare House, 303 Airport Road West, Belfast. They also add three further days on which the Union flag must be flown (9th January 21st June and 17th July).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

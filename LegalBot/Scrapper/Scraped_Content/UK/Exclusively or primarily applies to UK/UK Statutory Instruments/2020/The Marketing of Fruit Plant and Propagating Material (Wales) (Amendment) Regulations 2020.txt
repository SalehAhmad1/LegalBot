17 March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Marketing of Fruit Plant and Propagating Material (Wales) Regulations 2017, which implement Council Directive 2008/90/EC on the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production (OJ No. L 267, 8.10.2008, p. 8), and Commission Implementing Directive 2014/96/EU on the requirements for the labelling, sealing and packaging of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production, falling within the scope of Council Directive 2008/90/EC (OJ No. L 298, 16.10.2014, p. 12). These Regulations implement Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1813 (OJ No. L 278, 30.10.2019, p. 7), which amends Directive 2014/96/EU as regards the colour and content of a supplier’s document.
Regulation 2 makes provision requiring a supplier’s document affixed to CAC material in the form of a label to be yellow and reduces the information required in a supplier’s document. It also contains transitional provision.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

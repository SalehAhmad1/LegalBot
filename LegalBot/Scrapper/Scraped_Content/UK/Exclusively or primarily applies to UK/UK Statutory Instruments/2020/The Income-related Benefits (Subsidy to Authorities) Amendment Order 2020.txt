(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Income-related Benefits (Subsidy to Authorities) Order 1998 (S.I. 1998/562) (“the 1998 Order”) which provides for the calculation and payment of housing benefit subsidy to local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland which administer housing benefit. Section 140F(2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (c. 5) authorises the making, revocation or varying of an Order before, during or after the year to which it relates.
Article 3 and Schedule 1 substitute Schedule 1 to the 1998 Order which prescribes the sums to be used in the calculation of subsidy for the year beginning with 1st April 2019.
Article 4 and Schedule 2 have effect for the purposes of determining subsidy payable for the year beginning with 1st April 2020. They disapply the rent rebate subsidy limitation applying in respect of authorities in England and substitute Part 5 of Schedule 4A to the 1998 Order in respect of authorities in Wales. That Part sets out the specified amount “O” and the guideline rent increase “P” used when calculating deductions from subsidy under paragraph 4 in Part 4 of Schedule 4A.
Article 5 substitutes paragraph 2 of Schedule 1ZB to the 1998 Order. Schedule 1ZB prescribes a system for the making of additional payments of subsidy to authorities administering alerts relating to the earnings and pension entitlement of claimants for housing benefit and the substituted paragraph 2 has effect for the purposes of determining additional amounts of subsidy payable for the year beginning with 1st April 2020. The amounts were notified by the Secretary of State to local authorities on 16th April 2020.
Hard copies of the circular referenced in this Order are available from the Department for Work and Pensions, Local Authority Partnership, Engagement and Delivery Division, Room B120D, Warbreck House, Warbreck Hill, Blackpool, FY2 0YE.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

Coming into force
25 December 2020
The Welsh Ministers make these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred on them by section 2(2) of, and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(1).
The Welsh Ministers are designated for the purposes of measures relating to feed produced for or fed to food producing animals(2), measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields for the protection of public health(3), and measures in relation to the common agricultural policy of the European Union(4).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, and it appears to the Welsh Ministers that it is expedient for references to the EU instruments mentioned in regulation 2(3) of the Animal Feed (Composition, Marketing and Use) (Wales) Regulations 2016(5) (as amended by these Regulations) and regulation 2(5) of the Animal Feed (Hygiene, Sampling etc and Enforcement) (Wales) Regulations 2016(6) (as amended by these Regulations) to be construed as references to those EU instruments as amended from time to time.
There has been open and transparent public consultation during the preparation of these Regulations in accordance with the requirements of Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(7).

The European Communities Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”) was repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) (“the 2018 Act”) with effect from exit day. “Exit day” is defined in section 20 of the 2018 Act as 31 January 2020 at 11pm. Despite that repeal the 1972 Act continues to have effect with modifications until IP completion day, by virtue of section 1A of the 2018 Act. Section 1A was inserted by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c.1) (“the 2020 Act”). “IP completion day” is defined in section 1A as being 31 December 2020 at 11pm (the meaning given in section 39 of the 2020 Act). Section 2(2) of the 1972 Act was also previously amended by section 27(1) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c.51) and by section 3(3) of, and Part 1 of the Schedule to, the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c.7). Paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to the 1972 Act was inserted by section 28 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and amended by Part 1 of the Schedule to the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 and S.I. 2007/1388.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
Part 1 makes corrections and amendments to a number of sanctions regulations which have been made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act, namely the Iran (Sanctions) (Human Rights) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/134), the Venezuela (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/135), the Burma (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/136), the Republic of Guinea-Bissau (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/554), the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/600), the Zimbabwe (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/604), the Chemical Weapons (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/618), the Syria (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/792), the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855), the Burundi (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1142) and the Guinea (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1145).
Part 2 makes revocations which are consequential on the provisions in those sanctions regulations, namely the revocation of the asset-freezing and export control legislation which has been superseded by those sanctions regulations.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations, as the instrument is intended to ensure existing sanctions remain in place following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. An impact assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and can be found at:

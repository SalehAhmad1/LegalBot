(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16), and complementary powers in the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 (i.e. sections 22 and 57), in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies in retained EU law (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (c) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) Regulations 2002 (“the 2002 Regulations”) by revoking regulation 27B. Regulation 27B implemented Directive (EU) 2015/413 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ No. L 68, 13.3.15, p.9) facilitating cross-border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences.
Regulation 27B of the 2002 Regulations provided that, in order to facilitate the investigation by a European Union member State of a road safety related traffic offence to which the Directive applies committed in that member State using a vehicle registered in the UK, the Secretary of State was to make available to the member State, upon request, the identity of the registered keeper of the vehicle, and related information, from the statutory register of vehicles and their keepers maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency under the 2002 Regulations.
Regulation 3 revokes the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2017 which inserted regulation 27B into the 2002 Regulations.
Regulation 4 substitutes “IP completion day” for “exit day” in amendments made to the 2002 Regulations by the Road Vehicles (Registration, Registration Plates and Excise Exemption) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018.
An Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen and the impact on the public sector is unclear at this stage. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk. The Directive referred to above is published on the EUR-Lex website (http://eur-lex.europa.eu).

11 March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 80(1)(a) and (b) of the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016 (“the Act”) require Social Care Wales to keep a register of social workers and social care workers of any other description specified by the Welsh Ministers in regulations.
The Social Care Wales (Specification of Social Care Workers) (Registration) Regulations 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”) specify the descriptions of social care workers for whom a register must be kept.
These Regulations amend regulation 3 of the 2016 Regulations by substituting paragraph (2)(b) and inserting a new paragraph (2)(bb) to provide that a register must be kept by Social Care Wales of individuals who are employed (whether as an employee or a worker), or engaged under a contract for services to provide care and support in connection with a care home service provided wholly or mainly to adults, a care home service provided wholly or mainly for children, a secure accommodation service, a domiciliary support service or a residential family centre service.
The requirement for Social Care Wales to keep a register of individuals employed or engaged under a contract for services in connection with a care home service provided wholly or mainly to adults and a residential family centre services is added by these Regulations.
The requirement for Social Care Wales to keep a register of individuals in connection with a care home service provided wholly or mainly for children and a secure accommodation service, is extended by these Regulations to require the registration of individuals engaged under a contract of services (including agency workers) in addition to individuals who are employed by the service provider.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

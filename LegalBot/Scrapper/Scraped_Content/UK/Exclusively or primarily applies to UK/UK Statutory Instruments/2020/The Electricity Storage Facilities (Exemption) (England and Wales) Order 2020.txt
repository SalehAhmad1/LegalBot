(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides for exemptions from the requirement in section 36(1) of the Electricity Act 1989 (c. 29) (the “1989 Act”) to obtain consent for the construction, extension, or operation of generating stations where they comprise certain kinds of electricity storage facility (an “exempt electricity storage facility”).
Article 2 defines an exempt electricity storage facility as a facility which generates electricity from energy that was converted from electricity by that facility, and is stored within that facility for the purpose of its future reconversion into electricity, but which is not a pumped hydroelectric storage facility.
Articles 3 and 4 provide for the exemption and the circumstances in which it applies for England and Wales respectively. Article 5 provides that the exemptions created by the Order do not affect the continuing validity of existing consents under section 36(1) of the 1989 Act and directions under section 90(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.

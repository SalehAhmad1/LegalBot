(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement the current version of Annex IV to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as amended by the Protocol of 1978 (“the Convention”). Annex IV contains regulations for the Prevention of Pollution by Sewage from Ships. The current version of Annex IV came into force internationally on 27th September 2003 and amendments have been made to it since that time. These Regulations implement all amendments to Annex IV as at the date of this statutory instrument. Future amendments to the Convention and other instruments referred to in these Regulations will be automatically incorporated into the Regulations by way of ambulatory reference (regulation 4).
As a consequence of these Regulations, the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Sewage and Garbage from Ships) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/3257) and amending instruments and provisions are revoked and other instruments are updated to refer to these Regulations (Schedule 1). The provisions in relation to the prevention of pollution by garbage from ships are now to be found in the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/621), which come into force simultaneously with these Regulations.
The Regulations apply to United Kingdom ships engaged on international voyages, wherever they may be, United Kingdom ships operating in polar waters and to other ships while they are within United Kingdom waters and engaged on international voyages. They do not apply to warships, naval auxiliary ships, other ships owned or operated by a State and used, for the time being, only on government non-commercial service or to any ship of less than 400 GT unless that ship carries more than 15 persons (regulation 6).
Part 2 of the Regulations imposes a prohibition on the discharge of sewage into the sea (regulation 7) which applies unless particular requirements are met. There are different requirements for passenger ships operating in a special area from the relevant date determined by the IMO onwards and for United Kingdom ships operating in polar waters.
Part 3 of the Regulations imposes requirements in relation to the equipment which must be utilised by ships and it covers sewage systems (regulation 8) and discharge connections (regulation 9).
Part 4 of the Regulations provides that a ship must not proceed to sea or (if it is already at sea) remain at sea unless a survey has been carried out and a Sewage Certificate has been issued (regulations 11 and 12). It also provides that an additional survey will be required following an important repair or renewal (regulation 21) and that the ship must be maintained to conform with the provisions of Part 3 (regulation 20).
Part 5 of the Regulations makes provision in relation to the powers of inspection and detention of ships, and in relation to offences and penalties.
The Secretary of State must review the operation and effect of these Regulations and publish a report within five years after they come into force and within every five years thereafter (regulation 36). Following such a review it will fall to the Secretary of State to consider whether the Regulations should remain as they are, or be revoked or amended. A further instrument would be needed to revoke the Regulations or to amend them.
Merchant Shipping Notices are published by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (“MCA”) and a copy of MSN No. M 1613 may be obtained free of charge at www.gov.uk or in hard copy from the MCA of Spring Place, 105 Commercial Road, Southampton SO15 1EG.

Until such publication is made, an amendment will be available from the MCA and on www.gov.uk.

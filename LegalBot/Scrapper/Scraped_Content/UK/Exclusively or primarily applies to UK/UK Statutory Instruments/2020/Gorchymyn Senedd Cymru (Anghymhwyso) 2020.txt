(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order designates, for the purposes of a Senedd Cymru election at which the poll is held on or after 5 April 2021, offices whose holders are disqualified from being a Member of the Senedd (but not from being a candidate to be a Member of the Senedd). The offices are described in the Schedule to this Order.
Other disqualifying offices and categories of person disqualified from being a Member of the Senedd (and in some cases from being a candidate to be a Member of the Senedd) are prescribed by section 16 of, and Schedule 1A to, the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32). This Order should be read with those provisions.
This Order revokes the National Assembly for Wales (Disqualification) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/1536), though that Order continues to have effect for a Senedd Cymru election at which the poll is held before 5 April 2021.

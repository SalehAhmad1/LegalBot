enable a regional approach to be taken to removals and additions to the list of exempt countries and territories, in Schedule A1 to the principal Regulations, from which passengers arriving in England are not required to self-isolate;
(b)
amend the entry for “Greece” to exclude specific Greek islands (Lesvos, Tinos, Serifos, Crete, Mykonos, Santorini and Zakynthos) from the list of exempt countries and territories, in Schedule A1;
(c)
amend the list of specified competitions in Schedule 3 to the principal Regulations, which is relevant to the exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for elite sportspersons.
Passengers are not required to self-isolate on arrival in England if, during the 14 days preceding their arrival, they have only been in or transited through exempt countries or territories, or exempt parts of countries or territories. Passengers who have been in or transited through a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory, must self‑isolate until 14 days have elapsed since the day after they last left a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory. The changes to Schedule A1 and Schedule 1 will not affect passengers who arrive in England before 4.00 a.m. on 9th September 2020.

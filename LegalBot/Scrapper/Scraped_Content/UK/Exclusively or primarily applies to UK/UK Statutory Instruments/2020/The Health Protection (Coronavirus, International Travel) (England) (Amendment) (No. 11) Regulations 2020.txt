(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) (“the principal Regulations”) to—
(a)
require all persons arriving in England from outside the common travel area to provide the address or addresses at which they will stay during the first 14 full days following their arrival in the United Kingdom (regulation 2(2), (3) and (5));
(b)
remove the Czech Republic, Jamaica and Switzerland from, and add Cuba to, the list of exempt countries and territories, in Schedule A1 to the principal Regulations, from which passengers arriving in England are not required to self-isolate (regulation 2(4));
(c)
amend the exemption for inspectors and surveyors of ships so that inspectors or surveyors appointed by a relevant British possession are exempt from the requirement to self‑isolate in regulation 4 of the principal Regulations and, if they meet the condition in paragraph 4G of Schedule 2 to those Regulations, the requirement to provide information in regulation 3 of the principal Regulations (regulation 2(6));
(d)
replace the list of specified competitions in Schedule 3 to the principal Regulations, which is relevant to the exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for elite sportspersons (regulation 2(7)).
Passengers are not required to self-isolate on arrival in England if, during the 14 days preceding their arrival, they have only been in or transited through exempt countries or territories. Passengers who have been in or transited through a non-exempt country or territory must self‑isolate until 14 days have elapsed since the day after they last left a non-exempt country or territory. The changes to Schedule A1 will not affect passengers who arrive in England before 4.00 a.m. on 29th August 2020.

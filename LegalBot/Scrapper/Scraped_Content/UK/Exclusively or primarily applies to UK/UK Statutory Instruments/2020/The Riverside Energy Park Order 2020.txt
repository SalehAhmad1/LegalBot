(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.

(a)
section 9(4) (refusal to convey, failure to make title etc.);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (persons without power to sell their interests);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restriction, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applied to compulsory acquisition under article 22), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12 (unauthorised entry) and 13 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 29(3) is also modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, or enforce the restriction imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A (counter–notice requiring purchase of land not in notice to treat) to the 1965 Act substitute—

(a)
acquires any interest in the RRRL land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed; or
(b)
requires that RRRL's apparatus within the RRRL land is relocated, diverted or removed,
any right of RRRL to any part of the RRRL land and/or to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, and that apparatus must not be relocated, diverted or removed, until equivalent rights have been granted to RRRL for alternative apparatus and equivalent alternative apparatus has vested in RRRL and (in relation to apparatus) has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided. The location of equivalent alternative apparatus and rights for the equivalent alternative apparatus must in each case be agreed between the undertaker and RRRL before any step is taken to extinguish, relocate, divert or remove as aforesaid.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under the RRRL land, the undertaker requires the relocation, diversion or removal of any apparatus placed in the RRRL land, the undertaker must give to RRRL for approval written notice of that requirement, a plan and section of the work proposed and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus together with a timetable for when the alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed by the undertaker.
(3) The approval of RRRL under sub-paragraph (2) must not be unreasonably withheld and if by the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which the notice, plan, section and timetable have been supplied to RRRL, RRRL has not intimated approval or disapproval of such notice, plan, section and timetable and the grounds of disapproval, RRRL is deemed to have approved the said notice, plan, section and timetable as submitted.
(4) When giving its approval under sub-paragraph (2), RRRL may specify such reasonable requirements that are necessary in the provision or construction of the alternative apparatus.
(5) In the event that RRRL issues a disapproval to the notice, plan, section and timetable within the 28 day period referred to in sub-paragraph (3), the undertaker may refer the matter to arbitration in accordance with article 42 (procedures in relation to certain approvals etc.).
(6) Subject to sub-paragraph (8), any alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed pursuant to this paragraph must be provided or constructed by the undertaker within a timescale, to a standard and in such manner and in such line or situation as is agreed with RRRL or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (procedures in relation to certain approvals etc.).
(7) Where the alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed on land of the undertaker and once the undertaker has provided or constructed the alternative apparatus, the undertaker must grant RRRL the necessary rights to access and maintain the alternative apparatus on that land.
(8) If in the approval to the notice, plan, section and timetable under sub-paragraph (2) or by the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which the arbitrator settles the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed, RRRL gives notice to the undertaker that it desires to provide or construct the alternative apparatus and this is agreed to by the undertaker, (acting reasonably) RRRL, after the grant to RRRL of the rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (9), must proceed without unnecessary delay to provide and construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule.
(9) Where RRRL is to provide or construct the alternative apparatus, and the alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed on land of the undertaker, the undertaker must grant RRRL the necessary rights to provide or construct the alternative apparatus on that land and grant RRRL the necessary rights to access and maintain the alternative apparatus on that land.

(6) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(7) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency works (as defined in the 1991 Act) but in that case it must give to RRRL notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.

(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule:–
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (procedures in relation to certain approvals etc.) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to RRRL by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3):–
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to RRRL in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on RRRL any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 16 to 22 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 21(2).

(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 42(3) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 21(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

54.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail's apparatus; and
“Network Rail's apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised development) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail's apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 48 for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker's compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail's apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 48) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail's apparatus identified under to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail's apparatus identified under to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail's apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail's apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 48(1) has effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) If at any time prior to the completion of the authorised development and regardless of any measures adopted under sub-paragraph (3), the testing or commissioning of the authorised development causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker's apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail's apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker's apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail's apparatus in the investigation of such EMI; and
(c)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail's apparatus or such EMI.
(8) Where Network Rail approves modifications to Network Rail's apparatus under sub-paragraph (5) or (6)—

Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail's apparatus; and
(b)
any modifications to Network Rail's apparatus approved under those sub-paragraphs must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 48.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 58 applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses suffered by Network Rail through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Network Rail's apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which sub-paragraph (6) applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 53(a) any modifications to Network Rail's apparatus under this paragraph are deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
(11) In relation to any dispute arising under this paragraph the reference in article 42(3) (procedures in relation to certain approvals etc.) to the Secretary of State is to be read as a reference to the Institution of Engineering and Technology.

(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by SGN on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by SGN or in accordance with any requirement of SGN or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless SGN fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed between the undertaker and SGN.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of SGN, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any authorised works and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by SGN as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 (benefit of order granting development consent) of the Planning Act 2008 or article 9 (consent to transfer benefit of order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section 3(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 114.
(4) SGN must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) SGN must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 114 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, SGN must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 114 for claims reasonably incurred by SGN.

Further information and consultation
3.—(1) In relation to any application to which this Schedule applies, the relevant authority has the right to request such reasonable further information from the undertaker as is necessary to enable it to consider the application.
(2) In the event that the relevant authority considers such further information to be necessary and the provision of the Order governing or requiring the application does not specify that consultation with a requirement consultee is required, the relevant authority must, within ten business days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing specifying the further information required.
(3) If the provision of the Order governing or requiring the application specifies that consultation with a requirement consultee is required, the relevant authority must issue the consultation to the requirement consultee within five business days of receipt of the application, and must notify the undertaker in writing specifying any further information requested by the requirement consultee within five business days of receipt of such a request and in any event within ten business days of receipt of the application.

Sch. 12 para. 3 in force at 1.5.2020, see art. 1
Appeals
4.—(1) The undertaker may appeal in the event that—
(a)
the relevant authority refuses (including a deemed refusal pursuant to paragraph 2(3)) an application for any consent, agreement or approval required or contemplated by any of the provisions of this Order or grants it subject to conditions;
(b)
on receipt of a request for further information pursuant to paragraph 3 the undertaker considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the relevant authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or
(c)
on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant authority notifies the undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the application.
(2) The appeal process is to be as follows—
(a)
any appeal by the undertaker must be made within 42 days of the date of the notice of the decision or determination, or (where paragraph 2(3) applies) expiry of the decision period as determined under paragraph 2(1);
(b)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the appeal parties;
(c)
as soon as is practicable following receipt of the appeal documentation, the Secretary of State is to appoint a person to determine the appeal (“the appointed person”) and must notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for that person's attention must be sent, the date of such notification being the “start date” for the purposes of this sub-paragraph (2);
(d)
the relevant authority and any requirement consultee must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within ten business days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(e)
the appeal parties must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within ten business days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph (d); and
(f)
the appointed person must decide the appeal and notify the appeal parties of the decision, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 30 business days of the deadline for the receipt of counter-submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (e).
(3) The appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (2)(c) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(4) If the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable consideration of the appeal the appointed person must, within five business days of his appointment, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required, the appeal part from whom the information is sought, and the date by which the information is to be submitted.
(5) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (4) is to be provided by the party from whom the information is sought to the appointed person and to the other appeal parties by the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the appointed person within ten business days of the specified date but otherwise is to be in accordance with the process and time limits set out in sub-paragraphs (2)(d) to (2)(f).
(6) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal, or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not),
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to the appointed person in the first instance.
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the prescribed time limits, or set by the appointed person, under this paragraph.
(8) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have been made within the prescribed time limits, if it appears to him that there is sufficient material to enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case.
(9) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the appeal parties, and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(10) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is deemed to be an approval for the purpose of any consent, agreement or approval required under the Order or for the purpose of Schedule 2 as if it had been given by the relevant authority. The relevant authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person's determination.
(11) The appointed person may or may not be a member of the Planning Inspectorate but must be a qualified town planner of at least ten years' experience.
(12) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (13) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(13) On application by the relevant authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to Planning Practice Guidance: Appeals (March 2014), published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Adjacent Waters Boundaries (Northern Ireland) Order 2002 (S.I 2002/791) (“the 2002 Order”).
Section 98(1) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (c. 47) defines the “Northern Ireland zone” as meaning the sea within British fishery limits which is adjacent to Northern Ireland. For the purpose of that definition, the 2002 Order describes the boundary between the parts of the sea within British fishery limits which are to be treated as adjacent to Northern Ireland and the parts which are not. This Order amends Article 3 of the 2002 Order to make a minor correction to the boundary.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on business, charities, voluntary bodies or the public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force the provisions of certain regulations which have been made under Part 1 of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (“the Act”).
In particular, these Regulations bring into force the sanctions regulations which have been made under section 1 of the Act to establish sanctions regimes in relation to certain countries or thematic issues (“regime regulations”). In accordance with the powers under section 56 of the Act, the Regulations provide that certain provisions of those regime regulations come into force on different days.
Where the regime regulations provide for the designation of persons, the provisions required for a person to be designated for the purposes of those regime regulations (whether by the Secretary of State or the United Nations Security Council and its Sanctions Committees) come into force on 14th December 2020; all other provisions in those regime regulations come into force on IP completion day.
Where the regime regulations do not provide for the designation of persons, their provisions come into force on IP completion day.

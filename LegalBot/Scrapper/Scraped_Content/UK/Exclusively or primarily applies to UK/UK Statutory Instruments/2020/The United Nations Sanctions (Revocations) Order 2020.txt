(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order revokes a number of instruments made under the United Nations Act 1946 (c.45) implementing United Nations sanctions, which are no longer required. Some of these revocations relate to sanctions regimes which have been terminated or suspended by the United Nations or which have expired. Some instruments relating to the Isle of Man, the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Bailiwick of Jersey are revoked because sanctions regimes are now implemented in those jurisdictions through their domestic law. Some instruments relating to British overseas territories are revoked because they amended Orders which have already been revoked. Some revocations relate to United Nations sanctions obligations implemented through European Union regulations but which will be implemented through United Kingdom domestic law, including European Union retained law, following IP completion day.
An Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this instrument: no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sectors in the United Kingdom.

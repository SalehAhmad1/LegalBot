The amendments in section 88 of the 2017 Act (functions of Ofcom in relation to the BBC) amend section 198 of, and insert section 198ZA into, the 2003 Act and come into force in the Isle of Man on 1st March 2020. The amendments in section 89 of the 2017 Act (TV licence fee concessions by reference to age) amend section 365 of, and insert section 365A into, the 2003 Act and come into force in the Isle of Man on 1st June 2020.

The BBC will have the power to make changes to the concession, including changing the eligibility criteria, level of concession and qualifying age (although this may not be lower than 65) or to end the concession. The Secretary of State retains the power to make provision for all other concessions including the current residential care concession or its equivalent.

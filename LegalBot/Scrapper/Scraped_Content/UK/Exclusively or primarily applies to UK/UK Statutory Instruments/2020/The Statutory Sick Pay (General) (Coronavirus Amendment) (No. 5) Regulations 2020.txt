3rd August 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends Schedule 1 to the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982 (S.I. 1982/894) to ensure that a person is entitled to statutory sick pay for the full period for which they are required to self-isolate and for the period a person is required to stay at home after testing positive for coronavirus.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations in view of the urgency required to provide additional financial support to those unable to work as a result of coronavirus.

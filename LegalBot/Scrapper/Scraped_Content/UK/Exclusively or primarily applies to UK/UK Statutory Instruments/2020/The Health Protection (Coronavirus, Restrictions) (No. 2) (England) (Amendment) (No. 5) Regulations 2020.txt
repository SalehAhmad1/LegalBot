Approved by both Houses of Parliament
Made
on 23rd September 2020
Laid before Parliament
on 24th September 2020
Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1(2) and (3)
The Secretary of State makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 45C(1), (3)(c), (4)(b) and (d), 45F(2) and 45P of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 M1.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in England.
The Secretary of State considers that the restrictions and requirements imposed by the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) (England) Regulations 2020 M2, as amended by these Regulations, are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with section 45R of that Act the Secretary of State is of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.

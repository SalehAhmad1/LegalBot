(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions (England) General Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/3483) together with the Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions (England) Representations and Appeals Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/3482) provide for the civil enforcement of parking contraventions in England (including Greater London) in accordance with Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 (c.18).
The Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions (England) General Regulations 2007 allow for a notice of a penalty charge in respect of a parking contravention to be sent through the post on the basis of CCTV evidence alone. Those Regulations were amended by the Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions (England) General (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1001) to require that a notice of a penalty charge in respect of a parking contravention on a road in a civil enforcement area must be given by a civil enforcement officer affixing it to the vehicle, subject to certain exceptions. These Regulations add a new exception. The new exception is where a vehicle is stationary in a mandatory cycle lane and there are waiting and/or loading restrictions in place.
These Regulations also update the definition of the “Traffic Signs Regulations” to refer to the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 (S.I. 2016/362) (TSRGD). The TSRGD came into force on 22nd April 2016 and revoked the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 (S.I. 2002/3113).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument revokes the Official Controls (Plant Health and Genetically Modified Organisms) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (“the 2020 Regulations”) (S.I. 2020/381).
The 2020 Regulations made amendments to the Official Controls (Plant Health and Genetically Modified Organisms) (England) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1517) to impose additional emergency measures to prevent the establishment or spread of the following harmful plant pests in England— (a) Ceratocystis platani (J.M. Walter) Engelbr. & T.C. Harr.; (b) Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi; (c) Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire; and (d) Xylella fastidiosa (Wells et al.) This instrument removes those amendments in so far as they relate to Ceratocystis platani and Xylella fastidiosa.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

Coming into force

The Secretary of State makes these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 10(4) and (4A) and 201(3) of the Representation of the People Act 1983(1) and sections 8(1) and 9(6) of the Electronic Communications Act 2000(2).
In accordance with section 8(3) of the Electronic Communications Act 2000(3), the Secretary of State considers that the authorisation of the use of electronic communications by these Regulations for any purpose is such that the extent (if any) to which records of things done for that purpose will be available will be no less satisfactory in cases where use is made of electronic communications than in other cases.
The Secretary of State has consulted the Electoral Commission, in accordance with section 10(4) of the Representation of the People Act 1983, about the requirements as to the form or content of the form to be used for the purposes of a canvass.

“the UK digital service” has the same meaning as in section 10ZF (Digital registration in Northern Ireland) of the 1983 Act(2), and a reference to a canvass form submitted through the UK digital service or any other thing done through the UK digital service is be construed in accordance with subsection (4) of that section.
(2) Any reference in these Regulations to a provision of the 1983 Act which has been applied by section 2(1) of, and Schedule 1 to, the Elected Authorities (Northern Ireland) Act 1989(3) includes a reference to that provision as applied and with any modifications specified in Part 2 of that Schedule.
(1)

(a)
the relevant person’s full name;
(b)
the address at which the relevant person is entitled to be registered;
(c)
in the case of a relevant person who no longer claims to be entitled to be registered at an address in respect of which the relevant person is currently registered as an elector, either—
(i)
the fact that the relevant person has ceased to be resident at that address, or
(ii)
the fact that the registration was in pursuance of a service declaration, a declaration of local connection or an overseas elector’s declaration, and the fact that the relevant person is no longer entitled to make that declaration;
(d)
in the case of a relevant person who has stated pursuant to section 10(4A)(c)(i) of the 1983 Act that the relevant person does not have a national insurance number, the reason why the relevant person does not have one;
(e)
the relevant person’s nationality or if the relevant person is not able to provide that information the reason why not, and

the relevant person is the person named in the form;
(b)
the information provided in the form and any declaration accompanying it is true;
(c)
if applicable, paragraph (3) has been complied with, and
(d)
where, under paragraph (4), the relevant person instructs a person to submit it on their behalf, the person submitting it is over 18 years and has submitted it in the relevant person’s presence.
(3) Where a relevant person is unable to read, the relevant person must arrange for the declaration mentioned in paragraph (2) to be read out to the relevant person before the form is submitted.

(6) Regulation 6 (electronic signatures and related certificates)(2) of the 2008 Regulations applies to a canvass form as if it were an application and the requirement that it be submitted with a signature (where applicable) were a requirement of the 2008 Regulations.
(1)
Regulation 5 was amended by S.I. 2018/699.

(4) Where the relevant person has replied making such a request within that period, the request must be treated as part of the relevant person’s form.Revocations
7.  The following provisions of the 2008 Regulations are revoked—

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Under section 10 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2) the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland (as the electoral registration officer) is required to conduct a canvass in Northern Ireland in such years as are determined in accordance with section 10ZA of that Act (by reference to residence on 15th October in that year).
The Representation of the People (Electronic Communications and Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/581), which are made on the same day as these Regulations, make provision for the canvass to be conducted digitally in Northern Ireland.
These Regulations make provision about the form used for the purposes of a canvass, replacing regulation 46A of, and Form O in Schedule 3 to, the Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/1741). They specify content required to be included in such forms, requirements relating to their submission and steps to be taken by the registration officer where certain types of form are used.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

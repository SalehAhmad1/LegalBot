Department of Health and Social CareEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the protected areas in the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Leicester) (No 2) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/824), the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (North of England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/828), the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Birmingham, Sandwell and Solihull) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/988) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (North East of England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1010).
In relation to those instruments and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Bolton) Regulations 2020, the Regulations also enable households to be “linked childcare households” for the purpose of providing informal childcare. This has the effect of exempting those households from the rules on restrictions of gathering in private dwellings where reasonably necessary for the provision of informal childcare.
The Regulations also make an amendment consequential on the change of name of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (North East of England) Regulations 2020 to Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (North East and North West of England) Regulations 2020, and revoke the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Blackburn with Darwen and Bradford) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/822) and its amending instruments.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for the conduct of local authority meetings held before 7th May 2021, and for public and press access to these meetings.
Part 1 sets out preliminary matters and defines terms used in the Regulations. Part 2 makes provision for remote access to meetings of local authorities by members of a local authority and by the press and public. Regulation 4 enables local authorities to hold and alter the frequency and occurrence of meetings without requirement for further notice. Regulation 5 makes provision for members of local authorities to attend meetings remotely.
Part 3 modifies existing legislative requirements for local authority meetings. Regulation 6 disapplies provisions requiring local authorities to hold annual meetings. Regulation 7 modifies requirements for annual meetings of the Greater London Assembly and disapplies the requirements to hold certain public meetings. Regulations 8 to 12 modify legislation for the specified conservation boards and National Parks authorities to disapply annual meeting requirements and to enable electronic notice of meetings. Regulations 13 to 17 modify legislation relating to public and press access to information relating to decisions made by local authorities to enable such access to be available through remote means.
Parts 1, 2 and 3 of these Regulations apply to the Common Council of the City of London in its capacities as a local authority, a port health authority and a police authority.
Part 4 amends the Police and Crime Panels (Application of Local Authority Enactments) Regulations 2012 in order to apply part of these regulations to Police and Crime Panels.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument will have no impact on the costs of business and the voluntary sector.

8th June 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 3(1)(a) of the Direct Payments to Farmers (Legislative Continuity) Act 2020 (c. 2) ("the 2020 Act") in order to enable retained EU law governing the CAP direct payment schemes for the claim year 2020 to operate effectively and to address other deficiencies arising from the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
These regulations make further amendments, in regulations 2 to 5 to the EU law governing the CAP direct payment schemes that became domestic law at 11:00pm on 31 January 2020 pursuant to the 2020 Act. Regulation 6 amends the domestic regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 as they relate to direct payments. Finally regulation 7 corrects errors in previous amending regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

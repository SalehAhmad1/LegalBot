Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under section 84 of the Coronavirus Act 2020 and postpones to 31st July 2021 the date on which the Convocations of Canterbury and York are dissolved.
The effect of that is to postpone the elections to the General Synod of the Church of England, which had otherwise been expected to be held this autumn. Under paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 2 to the Synodical Government Measure 1969, the General Synod is automatically dissolved when the Convocations are dissolved.
Article 3 of the Order makes provision for matters which are ancillary to the postponement, including provision for membership of the General Synod, offices held in the Synod and membership of any body of the Synod or constituted under the Church Representation Rules.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under sections 8(2)(c) and 8(2)(g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of compulsory motor insurance. The amendment in regulation 2 changes the cut-off point for the continuation of transitional claims for compensation from the UK Motor Insurers Bureau (the MIB) under an EEA-wide scheme for victims of traffic accidents occurring in other EEA member states (the ‘visiting victims’ scheme). The cut-off point is changed to the end of the transition period, to reflect the fact that the visiting victims scheme continues during the transition period by virtue of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community. The amendment in regulation 3 ensures that UK and Gibraltarian residents continue to have the right to issue proceedings against the insurer of the person responsible for an accident in the UK after the end of the transition period.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

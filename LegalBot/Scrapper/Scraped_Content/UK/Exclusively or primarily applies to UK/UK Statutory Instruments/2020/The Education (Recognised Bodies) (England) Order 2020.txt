(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, made under section 216(1) of the Education Reform Act 1988, lists all the bodies that appear to the Office for Students to be recognised bodies within section 216(4) of the Education Reform Act 1988, which are situated within England (in accordance with section 216(2ZA) of the Education Reform Act 1988). It does not include recognised bodies that are situated in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland; they are listed in separate orders that are published by the devolved governments of those countries.
This Order updates and replaces the list of bodies contained in the Education (Recognised Bodies) (England) Order 2013 (S.I. 2013/2992), which is revoked. There are omitted from the Schedule to this Order some bodies that were listed in the previous Order which have merged with other bodies. Some new bodies have been included in the Schedule to this Order, as these bodies now appear to the Office for Students to fall within section 216(4) of the Education Reform Act 1988. The Schedule also takes account of name changes since the 2013 Order was made.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

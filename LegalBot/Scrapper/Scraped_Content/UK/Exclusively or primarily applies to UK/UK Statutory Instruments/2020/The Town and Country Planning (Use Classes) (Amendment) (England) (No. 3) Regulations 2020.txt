At 10.45 a.m. on 25th August 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/757) “the 2020 Regulations” to correct a minor drafting error. Regulation 13 of the 2020 Regulations inserts a new Schedule 2 into the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/764). In Part B of that Schedule 2, in paragraph (a)(i) of Class F.2 the words “square” and “metres” were placed the wrong way around. This instrument corrects that drafting error to make express what was already understood to be the effect of paragraph (a)(i).
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as they have no impact on the costs of business, the voluntary sector or the public sector; they merely correct a drafting error.
As this instrument has been made in consequence of an error in the 2020 Regulations, it is being issued free of charge to all known recipients of those Regulations.

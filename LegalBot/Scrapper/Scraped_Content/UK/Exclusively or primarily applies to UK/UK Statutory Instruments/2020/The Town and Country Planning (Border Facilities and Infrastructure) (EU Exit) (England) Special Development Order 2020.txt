This Order grants temporary planning permission for development consisting of the use of land for the stationing and processing of vehicles (particularly goods vehicles) entering or leaving Great Britain, and the provision of associated temporary facilities and infrastructure.

The development must end by 31 December 2025, and all reinstatement works must have been completed by 31 December 2026.
Article 1(2) and Schedule 1 specify the areas to which the Order applies. Article 3 grants the temporary planning permission, describes the development permitted and provides that permission is granted subject to conditions, including those set out in Schedule 2.
Article 4 provides that before the development of a particular site can start, a border department must obtain the approval of the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government. It also sets out the information that must be included in submissions for such approval.
Schedule 3 sets out the parties that must be given an opportunity to comment on proposed developments. A report on engagement with these parties, and their views, must be included in submissions for approval under article 4.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

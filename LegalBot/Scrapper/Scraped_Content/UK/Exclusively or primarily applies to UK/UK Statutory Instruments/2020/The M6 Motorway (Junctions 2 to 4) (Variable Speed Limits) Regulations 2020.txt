3.  In this Schedule—
“Ansty Interchange” means the circulatory interchange at junction 2;

(b)
that length of the south-eastbound carriageway beginning at a point 248 metres east of the eastern edge of the M6 overbridge and ending at the merge with the south-eastbound carriageway of the M6 at junction 3A.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce variable speed limits to—
(a)
the north-westbound and south-eastbound carriageways of the M6 motorway between junctions 2 and 4;
(b)
entry roads and exit roads at junctions 2, 3 and 4 of the M6 motorway; and
(c)
short sections of the north-westbound and south-eastbound carriageways of the M6 Toll motorway between junction 3A of the M6 motorway and junction 7A of the M42 motorway.
Regulation 3 provides for variable speed limits to have effect on the roads specified in paragraph 1 of the Schedule. Where variable speed limit signs are in operation a vehicle may not be driven at a speed above the maximum indicated by each speed limit sign passed by a vehicle until it passes a sign indicating that the national speed limit applies or the vehicle leaves the roads covered by the regulation. Where a speed limit changes less than ten seconds before a vehicle passes the sign and the sign had indicated a higher speed limit, the regulation allows the driver to proceed at a speed up to the maximum applicable before the change. Where the speed limit sign indicates a speed limit when it is passed by a vehicle but less than ten seconds previously it was either giving no indication of a speed limit or that the national speed limit applied, the sign is to be taken as giving no indication of a speed limit to the vehicle passing it.
Regulation 4 amends the M42 (Junctions 3A to 7) (Actively Managed Hard Shoulder and Variable Speed Limits) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/1671) in consequence of the meeting of a section of road to which these Regulations apply with a section of road to which variable speed limits apply under those 2005 Regulations.
Contravention of these Regulations is an offence under section 17(4) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations as no impact on the cost of business or the voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk .

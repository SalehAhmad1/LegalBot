(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Road Vehicles (Defeat Devices, Fuel Economy and Type-Approval) (Amendment) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/673) “the 2018 Regulations” for the purposes of the coming into force of a new test procedure for measuring CO2 emissions from passenger cars.
Regulation 2 amends the commencement date in regulation 1(b) of the 2018 Regulations from 6th April 2020 to 1st April 2020. This brings forward the coming into force of regulation 4(b) of the 2018 Regulations.
Regulation 4(b) of the 2018 Regulations amends the Passenger Car (Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Information) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/3523); amending the definition of “official specific emissions of CO2” in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2017/1151, which changes the basis of the test to be used to measure fuel economy from the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) to the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP).
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as they have no, or no significant impact on the cost of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector.

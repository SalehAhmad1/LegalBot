15.—(1) Any highway to be constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed in writing between Network Rail and the highway authority in whose area the highway lies, must be maintained by and at the expense of Network Rail for a period of 12 months from its completion and from the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the highway authority.
(2) Where a highway is altered or diverted under this Order, the altered or diverted part of the highway must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway authority in whose area the highway lies, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the street authority, be maintained by and at the expense of Network Rail for a period of 12 months from its completion and from the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the highway authority.
(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply in relation to the structure of any bridge or tunnel carrying a highway over or under any railway of Network Rail.
(4) In any action against Network Rail in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a highway under this article, it is a defence (without affecting any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that Network Rail had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the highway to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(5) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (4), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the highway and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a highway of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the highway;
(d)
whether Network Rail knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the highway to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the highway; and
(e)
where Network Rail could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the highway before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that Network Rail had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the highway to which the action relates unless it is also proved that Network Rail had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the highway and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.Access to works
16.—(1) Network Rail may, for the purposes of the authorised works—
(a)
form and lay out means of access, or improve existing means of access, in the locations specified in columns (1) and (2) of Schedule 12 (access to works); and

(a)
make provision for the street authority to carry out any function under this Order which relates to the street in question; and
(b)
contain such terms as to payment and otherwise as the parties consider appropriate.Construction of bridges
18.—(1) Any bridge to be constructed under this Order for carrying a highway over or under a railway must be constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the highway authority, but such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
(2) If within 28 days of receiving an application for approval under paragraph (1) a highway authority fails to notify Network Rail of its decision or refuses approval without giving any grounds for its refusal that highway authority is deemed to have granted approval.Discharge of water
19.—(1) Network Rail may use any watercourse or any public sewer or drain for the drainage of water in connection with the construction or maintenance of the authorised works and for that purpose may lay down, take up and alter pipes and may, on any land within the Order limits, make openings into, and connections with, the watercourse, public sewer or drain.
(2) Any dispute arising from the exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph (1) to connect to or use a public sewer or drain is to be determined as if it were a dispute under section 106 (right to communicate with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991(1).
(3) Network Rail must not discharge any water into any watercourse, public sewer or drain except with the consent of the person to whom it belongs; and such consent may be given subject to such terms and conditions as that person may reasonably impose, but must not be unreasonably withheld.

in accordance with plans approved by the person to whom the sewer or drain belongs, but such approval must not be unreasonably withheld; and
(b)
where that person has been given the opportunity to supervise the making of the opening.
(5) Network Rail must not, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this article, damage or interfere with the bed or banks of any watercourse forming part of a main river.

(7) Nothing in this article overrides the requirement for an environmental permit under regulation 12(1)(b) (requirement of environmental permit) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016(2) .
(8) If a person who receives an application for consent or approval fails to notify Network Rail of a decision within 28 days of receiving an application for consent under paragraph (3) or approval under paragraph (4)(a) that person is deemed to have granted consent or given approval, as the case may be.
(9) In this article—
(a)
“public sewer or drain” means a sewer or drain which belongs to a sewerage undertaker, the Environment Agency, an internal drainage board, or a local authority; and
(b)
other expressions, excluding watercourse, used both in this article and in the Water Resources Act 1991(3) have the same meaning as in that Act.

(a)
at any time before or during the construction in the vicinity of a building of any part of the authorised works; or
(b)
after the completion of the construction of that part of the authorised works in the vicinity of a building at any time up to the end of the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which that part of the authorised works is first opened for use.

(6) Where a notice is served under paragraph (5)(a), (c) or (d), the owner or occupier of the building or land concerned may, by serving a counter-notice within the period of 10 days beginning with the day on which the notice was served, require the question whether it is necessary or expedient to carry out the protective works or to enter the building to be referred to arbitration under article 46 (arbitration).

protective works are carried out under this article to a building; and
(b)
within the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which the part of the authorised works constructed in the vicinity of the building is first opened for use it appears that the protective works are inadequate to protect the building against damage caused by the construction or operation of that part of the authorised works,
Network Rail must compensate the owners and occupiers of the building for any loss or damage sustained by them.
(9) Without affecting article 45 (no double recovery) nothing in this article relieves Network Rail from any liability to pay compensation under section 10(2)(1) (further provision as to compensation for injurious affection) of the 1965 Act.
(10) Any compensation payable under paragraph (7) or (8) is to be determined, in case of dispute, under Part 1 of the 1961 Act.

SCHEDULE 13
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply with the necessary modifications as respects compensation in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the following modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 12 to the Network Rail (East West Rail) (Bicester to Bedford Improvements) Order 2020 (“the 2020 Order”);
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 12 to the 2020 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken” substitute “a right over land is purchased”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 23 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 22 (power to acquire land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of rights under article 25(1) or (2) (power to acquire new rights)—
(a)
with the modification specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in the case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 23(1)), it has power, exercisable in the equivalent circumstances and subject to the equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (protection for interests of tenants at will etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 23(7)) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over the whole or part of a house, building or factory.
(2) But see article 26(3) (power to acquire subsoil or airspace only) of the Network Rail (East West Rail) (Bicester to Bedford Improvements) Order 2020, which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of its decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the proposed use of the right to be acquired, and
(c)
if the right is proposed to be acquired for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

PROVISIONS RELATING TO STATUTORY UNDERTAKERS ETC.
Apparatus of statutory undertakers etc. on land acquired
1.—(1) Sections 271 to 274(1) (power to extinguish rights of statutory undertakers etc, and power of statutory undertakers etc. to remove or re-site apparatus) of the 1990 Act apply in relation to any land acquired or appropriated by Network Rail under this Order subject to the following provisions of this paragraph; and all such other provisions of that Act as apply for the purposes of those provisions (including sections 275 to 278, which contain provisions consequential on the extinguishment of any rights under sections 271 and 272, and sections 279(2) to (4), 280 and 282(2), which provide for the payment of compensation) have effect accordingly.
(2) In the provisions of the 1990 Act, as applied by sub-paragraph (1), references to the appropriate Minister are references to the Secretary of State.
(3) Where any apparatus of public utility undertakers or of a public communications provider is removed in pursuance of a notice or order given or made under section 271, 272 or 273 of the 1990 Act, as applied by sub-paragraph (1), any person who is the owner or occupier of premises to which a supply was given from that apparatus is entitled to recover from Network Rail compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of effecting a connection between the premises and any other apparatus from which a supply is given.
(4) Sub-paragraph (3) does not apply in the case of the removal of a public sewer but where such a sewer is removed in pursuance of such a notice or order as is mentioned in that sub-paragraph, any person who is—
(a)
the owner or occupier of premises the drains of which communicated with that sewer; or
(b)
the owner of a private sewer which communicated with that sewer,
is entitled to recover from Network Rail compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of making the drain or sewer belonging to that person communicate with any other public sewer or with a private sewerage disposal plant.
(5) The provisions of the 1990 Act mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), as applied by that sub-paragraph, do not have effect in relation to apparatus as respects which paragraph 2, or Part 3 of the 1991 Act, applies.
(6) In this paragraph—
“public communications provider” has the same meaning as in section 151(1) of the 2003 Act; and
“public utility undertakers” has the same meaning as in the 1980 Act(3).
Apparatus of statutory undertakers etc. in stopped up streets
2.—(1) Where a street is stopped up under article 8 (closure of road level crossings), 9 (replacement and closure of footpath level crossings) or 13 (stopping up of streets) any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, along or across the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus, subject to the provisions of this paragraph, as if this Order had not been made.
(2) Where a street is stopped up under article 8, 9 or 13 any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, over, along or across the street may, and if reasonably requested to do so by Network Rail must—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in that other position.
(3) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must pay to any statutory utility an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the utility in or in connection with—
(a)
the execution of the relocation works required in consequence of the stopping up of the street; and
(b)
the doing of any other work or thing rendered necessary by the execution of the relocation works.
(4) If in the course of the execution of relocation works under sub-paragraph (2)—
(a)
apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(6) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a statutory utility in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) (and having regard, where relevant, to sub-paragraph (4)) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(7) Sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) do not apply where the authorised works constitute major transport works for the purposes of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act, but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of cost of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section; and
(b)
the allowable costs are to be borne by Network Rail and the statutory utility in such proportions as may be prescribed by any such regulations.
(8) In this paragraph—
“apparatus” has the same meaning as in Part 3 of the 1991 Act;
“relocation works” means work executed, or apparatus provided, under sub-paragraph (2); and
“statutory utility” means a statutory undertaker for the purposes of the 1980 Act or a public communications provider as defined in paragraph 1(6).
(1)
Sections 272 to 274 were amended by paragraph 103(1) and (2) of Schedule 17 to the Communications Act 2003 (c. 21).

Acquisition of apparatus
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the deposited plans, Network Rail must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Alternative apparatus
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, Network Rail acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of an undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in question.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Network Rail requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the undertaker in question and Network Rail within 21 days of the service of a notice under sub-paragraph (2), or in default of such agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(4) In any case where alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed under sub-paragraph (2), or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus, Network Rail must, subject to sub-paragraph (5), afford to the undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of Network Rail and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(5) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of Network Rail, or Network Rail is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (4), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Network Rail, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(6) The undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46, and after the grant to the undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (4) or (5), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by Network Rail to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(7) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (6), if Network Rail gives notice in writing to the undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of Network Rail, that work, instead of being executed by the undertaker, must be executed by Network Rail without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker.
(8) Nothing in sub-paragraph (7) authorises Network Rail to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail affords to an undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of Network Rail of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Network Rail and the undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of Network Rail, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Network Rail in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Network Rail to that undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Existing apparatus: protection and access
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2), Network Rail must submit to the undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and an officer of the undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by an undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If an undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by Network Rail, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to Network Rail of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Network Rail from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) Network Rail is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must repay to an undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any of the authorised works.
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule (other than apparatus that is re-used as alternative apparatus) is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions except where this has been solely due to using the nearest currently available type; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an undertaker in respect of works under sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Any dispute as to whether a financial benefit is conferred in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or as to the amount of such financial benefit which cannot be agreed is to be determined in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
Damage to apparatus: costs, losses, etc.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the authorised works any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of an undertaker or there is any interruption in any service provided or in the supply of any goods, by any undertaker Network Rail must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on Network Rail with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of an undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) An undertaker must give Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of Network Rail which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Enactments and agreements
11.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and an undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Network Rail on the date on which this Order is made.

17.—(1) Before beginning to construct any specified work, Network Rail must submit to the drainage authority plans of the specified work and such further particulars available to it as the drainage authority may within 28 days of the receipt of the plans reasonably require.
(2) Any such specified work must not be constructed except in accordance with such plans as may be approved in writing by the drainage authority, or determined under article 46 (arbitration).
(3) Any approval of the drainage authority required under this paragraph—
(a)
must not be unreasonably withheld;
(b)
is deemed to have been given if it is neither given nor refused within 2 months of the receipt of the plans for approval or where further particulars are submitted under sub-paragraph (1) within 2 months of the submission of those particulars, and, in the case of a refusal, accompanied by a statement of the grounds of refusal; and
(c)

(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (6) and paragraph 23, if within a reasonable period, being not less than 28 days from the date when a notice under sub-paragraph (3) is served upon Network Rail, it has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the requirements of the notice and subsequently to make reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the drainage authority may execute the works specified in the notice and any expenditure incurred by it in so doing is recoverable from Network Rail.
(5) In the event of any dispute as to whether sub-paragraph (3) is properly applicable to any work in respect of which notice has been served under that sub-paragraph, or as to the reasonableness of any requirement of such a notice, the drainage authority must not except in an emergency exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (4) until the dispute has been finally determined.
(6) If by reason of construction of the specified work the Agency’s access to flood defences or equipment maintained for flood defence purposes is materially obstructed, Network Rail must provide such alternative means of access to allow the Agency to maintain the flood defence or use the equipment no less effectively than before the obstruction.
20.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (5) Network Rail must from the commencement of the construction of the specified works maintain in good repair and condition and free from obstruction any drainage work which is situated within the limits of deviation and on land held by Network Rail for the purposes of or in connection with the specified works, whether or not the drainage work is constructed under the powers conferred by this Order or is already in existence.
(2) If any such drainage work which Network Rail is liable to maintain is not maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the drainage authority, the drainage authority may by notice in writing require Network Rail to repair and restore the work, or any part of such work, or (if Network Rail so elects and the drainage authority in writing consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to remove the work and restore the site to its former condition, to such extent and within such limits as the drainage authority reasonably requires.
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5) and paragraph 23, if, within a reasonable period being not less than 28 days beginning with the date on which a notice in respect of any drainage work is served under sub-paragraph (2) on Network Rail, Network Rail has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the reasonable requirements of the notice and has not subsequently made reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the drainage authority may do what is necessary for such compliance and may recover any expenditure incurred by it in so doing from Network Rail.
(4) In the event of any dispute as to the reasonableness of any requirement of a notice served under sub-paragraph (2), the drainage authority must not except in a case of an emergency exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (3) until the dispute has been finally determined.
(5) This paragraph does not apply to—
(a)
drainage works which are vested in the drainage authority, or which the drainage authority or another person is liable to maintain and is not precluded by the powers of the Order from doing so; and
(b)
any obstruction of a drainage work for the purpose of a work or operation authorised by this Order and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
21.  Subject to paragraph 23, if by reason of the construction of any specified work or of the failure of any such work the efficiency of any drainage work for flood defence purposes is impaired, or that drainage work is otherwise damaged, such impairment or damage must be made good by Network Rail to the reasonable satisfaction of the drainage authority and if Network Rail fails to do so, the drainage authority may make good the same and recover from Network Rail the expense incurred by it in so doing.
22.—(1) Network Rail must take all such measures as may be reasonably practicable to prevent any interruption of the free passage of fish in the fishery during the construction of any specified work.
(2) If by reason of—
(a)
the construction of any specified work; or
(b)
the failure of any such work,
damage to a fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the drainage authority may serve notice on Network Rail requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage, or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.
(3) Subject to paragraph 23, if within such time as may be reasonably practicable for that purpose after the receipt of written notice from the Agency of any damage or expected damage to a fishery, Network Rail fails to take such steps as are described in sub-paragraph (2), the drainage authority may take those steps and may recover from Network Rail the expense reasonably incurred by it in doing so.
(4) Subject to paragraph 23, in any case where immediate action by the Agency is reasonably required in order to secure that the risk of damage to the fishery is avoided or reduced, the drainage authority may take such steps as are reasonable for the purpose, and may recover from Network Rail the reasonable cost of so doing provided that notice specifying those steps is served on Network Rail as soon as reasonably practicable after the Agency has taken, or commenced to take, the steps specified in the notice.
23.  Nothing in paragraphs 19(4), 20(3), 21, 22(3) and (4) authorises the drainage authority to execute works on or affecting an operational railway forming part of Network Rail’s network without the prior consent in writing of Network Rail such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
24.  Network Rail must indemnify the drainage authority in respect of all costs, charges and expenses which the drainage authority may reasonably incur or have to pay or which it may sustain—
(a)
in the examination or approval of plans under this Part of this Schedule; and
(b)
in the inspection of the construction of the specified works or any protective works required by the drainage authority under this Part of this Schedule.
25.—(1) Without affecting the other provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail must indemnify the drainage authority from all claims, demands, proceedings, costs, charges, penalties, damages, expenses and losses, which may be made or taken against, recovered from, or incurred by, the drainage authority by reason of—
(a)
any damage to any drainage work so as to impair its efficiency for the purposes of flood defence;
(b)
any damage to the fishery;
(c)
any raising or lowering of the water table in land adjoining the authorised works or any sewers, drains and watercourses;
(d)
any flooding or increased flooding of any such lands; or
(e)
inadequate water quality in any watercourse or other surface waters or in any groundwater,
which is caused by the construction of any of the specified works or any act or omission of Network Rail, its contractors, agents or employees whilst engaged upon the work.
(2) The drainage authority must give to Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise may be made without the agreement of Network Rail which agreement must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
26.  The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done by Network Rail in accordance with plans approved by the drainage authority, or to the drainage authority’s satisfaction, or in accordance with any directions or award of an arbitrator, does not relieve Network Rail from any liability under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in the exercise of the powers in section 8(1) the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (e) and (g) and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of pilotage and port services. In particular, Part 2 amends the Pilotage Act 1987 and Part 3 amends Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 February 2017 establishing a framework for the provision of port services and common rules on the financial transparency of ports (“Regulation (EU) 2017/352”).
Part 4 revokes the adaptations of Regulation (EU) 2017/352 in paragraph 56z of Annex 13 to the EEA Agreement.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

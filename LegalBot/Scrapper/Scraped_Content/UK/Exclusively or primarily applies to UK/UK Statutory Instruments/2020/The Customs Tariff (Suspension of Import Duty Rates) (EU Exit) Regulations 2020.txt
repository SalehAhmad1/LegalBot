Provision is also made for a request to be withdrawn by the person who made it before such time as they are considered by the Secretary of State. Regulation 8 sets out the process for considering requests made to the Secretary of State under regulation 7(1) including the applicable exceptions to the circumstances in which the Secretary of State is required to consider such requests and provision for the circumstances in which such requests may be rejected.

2 November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Welsh in Education Strategic Plans (Wales) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1489 (W. 269)) (“the 2019 Regulations”) so that the requirement on local authorities in Wales to submit their first ten year plan by 31 January 2021 is amended to 31 January 2022. As a result of these Regulations, that first 10 year plan will have effect on 1 September 2022 until 31 August 2032 (instead of 1 September 2021 until 31 August 2031).
These Regulations also amend the requirement to submit the first review report no later than 31 July 2022 so that the first review report is to be submitted no later than 31 July 2023.
These amendments are made in response to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wales and the resulting pressures on local authorities. As a result it is not considered reasonable or appropriate to require local authorities to prepare their plans in accordance with the 2019 Regulations and to consult on them prior to submission to the Welsh Ministers for approval by 31 January 2021.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in airspace in the vicinity of Duxford Aerodrome, 
Cambridgeshire, during flying displays that are scheduled to take place there between 17th and 
20th September 2020. 
A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and 
therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should 
be restricted in the vicinity of the display for reasons of public safety. 
In relation to regulation 3, the term ‘aircraft’ includes aircraft as classified by Part 1 of Schedule 4 
to the Air Navigation Order 2016. It also includes, by virtue of article 23 of that Order, any small 
balloon, any kite weighing not more than two kilograms, any small unmanned aircraft and any 
parachute including a parascending parachute. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(2) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC), which for the 
purpose of these Regulations is one hour behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(3), the Duxford Aerodrome flying display 
director may be contacted as notified. 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr C W Scott, Principal Airspace 
Regulator, Safety and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 382997.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Schedule to the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982. The Schedule sets out categories of persons who are deemed to be incapable of work by reason of coronavirus.
Regulation 2 adds a new category of persons. These are persons defined in guidance issued by Public Health England, the Scottish Ministers or Public Heath Wales as being extremely vulnerable and at very high risk of severe illness from coronavirus because of an underlying health condition, and who have been advised, in accordance with that guidance, to follow rigorously shielding measures. The guidance is available from the following websites:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ (Public Health England).
https://www.gov.scot/publications/ (the Scottish Ministers).
https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/ (Public Heath Wales).
Hard copies of the guidance, as in effect at the date these Regulations are made, can be obtained by writing to the Legislation Team, the Department for Work and Pensions, Caxton House, Tothill Street, London SW1H 9NA.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations in view of the urgency required to provide additional financial support to those unable to work as a result of coronavirus.

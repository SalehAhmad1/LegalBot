These Regulations make amendments to a number of statutory instruments that made provision in relation to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. In particular, they amend the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/479); the Civil Legal Aid (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/505); the Family Procedure Rules 2010 and Court of Protection Rules 2017 (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/517), and the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/521) in order to update references to ‘exit day’ to ‘IP completion day’. These Regulations also amend those instruments, as well as the Service of Documents and Taking of Evidence in Civil and Commercial Matters (Revocation and Saving Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1257); the European Enforcement Order, European Order for Payment and European Small Claims Procedure (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1311); the Cross-Border Mediation (EU Directive) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/469); the Mutual Recognition of Protection Measures in Civil Matters (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/493), and the Criminal Justice (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/780), in order to ensure alignment with the United Kingdom’s obligations under articles 67, 68 and 69 of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, which make provision for the treatment of matters which are already ongoing at the end of the transition period.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Spirit Drinks Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/3206), the Wine Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/2936) and the European Union Withdrawal (Consequential Modifications) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1447).
Regulation 2 makes amendments to the Spirit Drinks Regulations 2008 in relation to the enforcement of Commission Regulation (EC) No 936/2009 applying the agreements between the European Union and third countries on the mutual recognition of certain spirit drinks (OJ No. L 264, 8.10.2009, p. 5). This includes an amendment making the contravention of Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 936/2009 an offence (regulation 2(3)).
Regulation 3 makes amendments to the Wine Regulations 2011 in relation to the enforcement of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1416/2006 laying down specific rules on the implementation of Article 7(2) of the Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on trade in wine concerning the protection of US names of origin in the Community (OJ No. L 267, 27.9.2006, p. 22). This includes an amendment making the contravention of the first sentence of Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1416/2006, as read with regulation 6A(2) of the Wine Regulations 2011 (inserted by regulation 3(5)), an offence (regulation 3(11)(a)).

This maintains the existing position regarding such references.

1947 c. 41, repealed by section 52 of, and Schedule 2 to, the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 (c. 21).

The name of the scheme was changed to the Firefighters’ Pension (Wales) Scheme by article 4 of that instrument. Section 26 of the Fire Services Act 1947 was amended by section 1 of the Fire Services Act 1951 (c. 27), section 42 of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (Protection of Civil Interests) Act 1951 (c. 65), section 33 of, and Schedule 3 to, the Theft Act 1968 (c. 60), sections 16 and 29 of, and Schedule 8 to, the Superannuation Act 1972 (c. 11), sections 100 and 101 of, and Schedule 27 to, the Social Security Act 1973 (c. 38), section 1 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Social Security (Consequential Provisions) Act 1975 (c. 18), section 32(2) of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 (c. 43), section 1 of the Police and Firemen’s Pensions Act 1997 (c. 52), section 256 of, and Schedule 25 to, the Civil Partnership Act 2004 (c. 33), and by S.I. 1976/551.

By virtue of paragraph 30 of Schedule 11 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32), functions under section 26 of the Fire Services Act 1947 are now vested in the Welsh Ministers so far as they are exercisable in relation to Wales.

(4)
2004 c. 21. The powers conferred by section 34(1) to (4) of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 are now vested in the Welsh Ministers so far as they are excisable in relation to Wales.

10 December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend—
(a)
the Firemen’s Pension Scheme Order 1992 which sets out, in Schedule 2, the Firefighters’ Pension (Wales) Scheme (“the 1992 Order”),
(b)
the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (Wales) Order 2007 which sets out, in Schedule 1, the New Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (Wales) (“the 2007 Order”),
(c)
the Firefighters’ Compensation Scheme (Wales) Order 2007 which sets out, in Schedule 1, the Firefighters’ Compensation Scheme (Wales) 2007 (“the 2007 Compensation Order”), and
(d)
the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (Wales) Regulations 2015 which set out the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (Wales) 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”).
Certain of the regulations have retrospective effect – these are set out in regulation 1(3). The following provisions in the enabling legislation permit regulations made under those provisions to have retrospective effect—
(a)
section 12 of the Superannuation Act 1972, as applied by section 16(3) of that Act in relation to orders made under section 26 of the Fire Services Act 1947,
(b)
section 34(3) of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, and
(c)
section 3(3)(b) of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013.
Regulations 3 to 5 make amendments to the 1992 Order. The amendments made by regulation 3(a), (c) and (d), ensure that a firefighter is not disadvantaged by the provision which allows for two pensions to be awarded, calculated separately, after a significant reduction in pay, and also make other minor updates. Regulation 3(b) clarifies that where a firefighter has an entitlement to two pensions under the 1992 Order, the amount of the first pension is uprated annually from the date that the firefighter ceased to earn the higher rate of pay.
The effect of the amendments in regulation 4 is to bring the benefits payable to survivors of civil partnerships and same sex marriages into line with the benefits payable to survivors of opposite-sex marriages.
Regulation 5 updates an out of date statutory reference in the 1992 Order.

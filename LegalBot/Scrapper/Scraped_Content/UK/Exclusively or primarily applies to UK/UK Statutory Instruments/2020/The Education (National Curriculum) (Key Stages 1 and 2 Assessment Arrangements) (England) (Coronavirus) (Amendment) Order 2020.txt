17th April 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes amendments to the secondary legislation relating to primary school assessments.
Articles 2 and 3 respectively disapply all those provisions of the Education (National Curriculum) (Key Stage 2 Assessment Arrangements) (England) Order 2003 and of the Education (National Curriculum) (Key Stage 1 Assessment Arrangements) (England) Order 2004 which place duties or obligations on head teachers, governing bodies and local authorities in relation to the Key Stages 1 and 2 assessments, checks and tests due to take place in school year 2019-20.
This has the effect that the Key Stages 1 and 2 assessments, checks and tests (and related obligations) which would otherwise have taken place in, or in relation to, academic year 2019-20 are no longer legally required.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

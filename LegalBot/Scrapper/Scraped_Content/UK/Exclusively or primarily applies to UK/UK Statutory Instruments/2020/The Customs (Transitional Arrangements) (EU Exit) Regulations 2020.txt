S.I. 2019/1215.James Morris
Maggie Throup
Two of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's TreasuryEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Regulations are made by the Treasury further to Part 1 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (c. 22) (“the Act”) and sections 24(3) and 26(1) of the Finance Act 2003 (c. 14). This is an EU Exit statutory instrument.
Regulation 1 provides for citation and commencement. The Regulations will largely be brought into force by way of a separate statutory instrument made under section 52 of the Act, but certain provisions will be brought into force 21 days after the Regulations are laid.
Regulation 3 inserts a new section A1 into Chapter 3 of Part 4 of the Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1248) (“the import duty regulations”). New section A1 makes provision for a procedure called the transitional EIDR simplified Customs declaration process. This is a process of simplified Customs declarations by way of making a declaration in two parts, a transitional simplified Customs declaration and a transitional supplementary Customs declaration. Provision includes who may use the process and when the parts of the Customs declaration must be made. New section A1 also provides for a procedure known as the transitional EIDR procedure whereby a transitional simplified Customs declaration is made by entering details in the declarant's electronic system. The transitional EIDR simplified Customs declaration process may not be used to declare goods imported, or to be imported, on or after 1st July 2021.
Regulation 3 also makes consequential amendments to other parts of the import duty regulations.

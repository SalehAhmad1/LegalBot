Both exemptions are for the establishment or installation of automotive short range radar equipment in a vehicle and the use of automotive short range radar equipment so established or installed.
These Regulations make amendments to ensure the scope of the Wireless Telegraphy (Automotive Short Range Radar) (Exemption) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/1437) remains the same following the end of the implementation period under the Withdrawal Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union.

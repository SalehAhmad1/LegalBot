(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes changes to electoral arrangements for the borough of Pendle following recommendations made by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. The area of the borough of Pendle remains unchanged.
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral wards of the borough of Pendle and replaces them with 12 new ones for the purpose of elections held on or after the ordinary day of election of councillors in England in 2020. It establishes the names and areas of the new electoral wards and the number of councillors for each.
Article 4 makes provision for a whole borough council election in 2020. Subsequently, the council will revert to the existing system of election by thirds. That article also provides for the order of retirement of councillors in 2022, 2023 and 2024 and the election of their replacements.
Article 5 makes changes to parish wards which are consequential on the changes made by article 3. The changes to parish wards introduced by article 5 come into force for the purpose of parish elections in 2023.

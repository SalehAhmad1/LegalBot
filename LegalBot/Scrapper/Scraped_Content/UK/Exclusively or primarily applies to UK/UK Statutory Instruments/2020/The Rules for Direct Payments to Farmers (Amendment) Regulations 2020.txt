Regulation 25 makes amendments to The Common Agricultural Policy Basic Payment and Support Schemes (England) Regulations 2014 No. 3259, which implements EU obligations in relation to the common agricultural policy direct payment scheme under the powers in section 2(2) of the European Community Act. These amendments only apply to England.
Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 (other than Article 13), Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 639/2014 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 641/2014, as amended by regulations 5 to 27, form part of domestic law on exit day by virtue of section 1(1) of the Act. The Common Agricultural Policy Basic Payment and Support Schemes (England) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3259), as amended by regulation 28, continues to have effect in domestic law on and after exit day by virtue of section 1B of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018(1).
Section 3(7) of the Act clarifies that provisions made by regulations under the powers in the Act may apply in relation to matters arising in relation to the CAP direct payment schemes for the whole of the 2020 claim year.
Regulation 1(2) disapplies paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 5 to the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020. This ensures that the regulations come into force on exit day.

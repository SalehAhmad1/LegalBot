tariffs available only to end-users who are carrying on a business; and
(b)
to monitor changes to those tariffs.
(2) The reference in subsection (1) to qualifying service tariffs is a reference to the tariffs used by the providers of qualifying services.
(3) In this section—
“qualifying services” means—
(a)
broadband services at a fixed location;
(b)
telephone services at a fixed location; and
(c)
mobile services, as defined by section 65(2BB)(a);
“tariff” includes a pricing structure.
Social tariff conditions
72D    Social tariff conditions: procedure
(1) The Secretary of State may direct OFCOM—
(a)
to review the affordability of qualifying services for individuals on low incomes or with special social needs, with a view to considering whether to recommend to the Secretary of State the setting of a social tariff condition; and
(b)
to report to the Secretary of State on the results of the review.
(2) OFCOM may in their report recommend—
(a)
the setting of a social tariff condition to be applied—
(i)
generally to every person providing a public electronic communications service;
(ii)
generally to every person providing a public electronic communications service of a particular description specified in the report; or
(iii)
to a particular person (or particular persons) specified in the report; or
(b)
the modification or revocation of a social tariff condition.
(3) OFCOM may recommend the application of a social tariff condition to a particular person (or particular persons) specified in their report only in exceptional circumstances, in particular where the application of a social tariff condition to all providers of public electronic communications services of a particular description would result in an excessive administrative or financial burden on those providers, on OFCOM or on any government department.
(4) The Secretary of State may give guidance to OFCOM as to the matters to which OFCOM are to have regard—
(a)
in carrying out a review under subsection (1)(a); and
(b)
in making a recommendation under subsection (2).
(5) OFCOM must not recommend the setting or modification of a social tariff condition unless they are satisfied that the condition or (as the case may be) the modification satisfies the test in section 47(2).
(6) Where section 72E does not apply to the recommendation because of subsection (2) of that section—
(a)
the recommendation must relate to a social tariff condition that is to be temporary, or to a temporary modification or revocation;
(b)
the recommendation must state the period for which it is proposed that the condition, or the modification or revocation, should have effect; and
(c)
section 72E does not apply in relation to any recommendation by OFCOM in relation to the extension or making permanent of the temporary condition, modification or revocation.
(7) The Secretary of State may direct OFCOM to implement any recommendation made under subsection (2).
(8) The Secretary of State must publish—
(a)
a direction given under subsection (1) or (7); and
(b)
guidance given under subsection (4).
(9) OFCOM must publish any report made under subsection (1)(b).
(10) In this section  “qualifying services” has the same meaning as in section 72C.
72E    Consultation by OFCOM on proposed recommendation
(1) This section applies where—
(a)
OFCOM propose to recommend the setting, modification or revocation of a social tariff condition; and
(b)
the implementation of the proposed recommendation would, in OFCOM's opinion, have a significant impact on a market for any of the services, facilities, apparatus or directories in relation to which they have functions under this Chapter.
(2) But this section does not apply where in OFCOM's opinion—
(a)
there are exceptional circumstances; and
(b)
there is an urgent need to act in order to safeguard competition and to protect the interests of consumers.
(3) OFCOM must publish a notification—
(a)
stating that they are proposing to recommend the setting, modification or revocation of the social tariff condition specified in the notification;
(b)
setting out the effect of that condition, modification or revocation;
(c)
giving their reasons for proposing the recommendation; and
(d)
specifying the period within which representations may be made to OFCOM about their proposal.
(4) That period must end no less than 30 days after the day of the publication of the notification.
(5) But where OFCOM are satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the use of a shorter period, the period specified as the period for making representations may be whatever shorter period OFCOM consider reasonable in those circumstances.
(6) OFCOM must consider every representation about the proposal made to them during the period specified in the notification.
(7) The publication of a notification under this section must be in such manner as appears to OFCOM to be appropriate for bringing the contents of the notification to the attention of such persons as OFCOM consider appropriate.
72F    Social tariff conditions: general
(1) The only provision that may be contained in a social tariff condition set under section 45 is provision requiring the use in relation to a qualifying service, in such cases as may be specified or described in the condition, of such social tariffs as may be so specified or described.
(2) For this purpose a “social tariff” is a special tariff that differs from the tariff provided under normal commercial conditions and is available to an individual who meets criteria relating to low income or special social needs.
(3) A social tariff condition may not be set, modified or revoked under section 45 except in accordance with a direction under section 72D(7).
(4) Subsection (3) does not apply to modifications that in the opinion of OFCOM—
(a)
relate only to matters of administration; and
(b)
are minor in character.
(5) If by virtue of subsection (4) OFCOM modify a social tariff condition under section 45 in the absence of a direction under section 72D(7), they must, when publishing a notification of the modification under section 48(1), send a copy of the notification to the Secretary of State.
(6) In this section “qualifying service” and “tariff” each has the same meaning as in section 72C.
72G    Review of compliance costs: social tariff conditions
(1) OFCOM may from time to time review the extent (if any) of the financial burden for a particular communications provider of complying in relation to any matter with a social tariff condition applied to the provider.
(2) The financial burden of so complying is to be taken to be the amount calculated by OFCOM to be the net cost of compliance after allowing for market benefits accruing to the communications provider from the application to the provider of the social tariff condition.
(3) After carrying out a review under this section OFCOM must either—
(a)
cause the calculations made by them on the review to be audited by a person who appears to them to be independent of the communications providers who are subject to the social tariff condition; or
(b)
themselves carry out an audit of those calculations.
(4) OFCOM must ensure, in the case of every audit carried out under subsection (3), that a report on the audit—
(a)
is prepared; and
(b)
if not prepared by OFCOM, is provided to them.
(5) It shall be the duty of OFCOM, in the case of every review under this section, to publish—
(a)
their conclusions on the review; and
(b)
a summary of the report of the audit which was carried out as respects the calculations made for the purposes of that review.
(6) The publication of anything under subsection (5) must be a publication in such manner as OFCOM consider appropriate for bringing it to the attention of the persons who, in their opinion, are likely to be affected by it.
72H    Sharing of burden of social tariff obligations
(1) This section applies where OFCOM—
(a)
have concluded, on a review under section 72G, that complying in relation to any matter with social tariff conditions imposes a financial burden on a particular communications provider (“the social tariff provider”); and
(b)
have published that conclusion in accordance with that section.
(2) OFCOM must determine, in the case of the social tariff provider, whether they consider it would be unfair for that provider to bear, or to continue to bear, the whole or any part of so much of the burden.
(3) If—
(a)
OFCOM determine that it would be unfair for the social tariff provider to bear, or to continue to bear, the whole or a part of the burden, and
(b)
an application for a determination under this subsection is made to OFCOM by that provider,
OFCOM may determine that contributions are to be made by communications providers to whom general conditions are applicable for meeting that burden.
(4) Subsections (4) to (9) of section 71 apply for the purposes of this section as if—
(a)
references to the designated universal service provider were references to the social tariff provider;
(b)
references to universal service conditions were references to social tariff conditions;
(c)
the reference to an application for the purposes of subsection (3)(b) of that section were a reference to an application for the purposes of subsection (3)(b) of this section;
(d)
references to contributions under subsection (3) of that section were references to contributions under subsection (3) of this section;
(e)
references to regulations made under that section were references to regulations made under subsections (4) to (7) of that section as applied by this subsection.
72I    Report on sharing mechanism: social tariff obligations
(1) This section applies where regulations made under section 71(4) to (7) as applied by section 72H(4) provide for a scheme for the assessment, collection and distribution of contributions under subsection (3) of that section.
(2) OFCOM must prepare and publish a report setting out, in relation to the period to which it applies—
(a)
every determination by OFCOM that has had effect in relation to a time in that period as a determination of the costs of providing anything contained in a social tariff condition;
(b)
the market benefits for each communications provider to whom a social tariff condition applies that have accrued to that provider during that period from the application to the provider of the social tariff condition; and
(c)
the contribution made under section 72H(3) by every person who has made a contribution during that period.
(3) The first report under this section must be prepared in relation to the period of twelve months beginning with the coming into force of the first regulations to be made under section 71(4) to (7) as applied by section 72H(4).
(4) Every subsequent report must be prepared in relation to the period of 12 months beginning with the end of the period to which the previous report applied.

Section 73 was amended by S.I. 2011/1210.
31.—(1) Section 74 (specific types of access-related conditions) is amended as follows.
(2) After subsection (2) insert—
“(2A) The conditions that may be set by virtue of section 73(2) also include conditions imposing on a person who provides an electronic communications network that includes a line or associated facility to which this subsection applies, or who owns such a line or associated facility, obligations for the purposes of giving to other persons such entitlements as OFCOM may from time to time direct as respects the availability and use of the line or associated facility in cases where OFCOM are satisfied that it would be economically inefficient or physically impracticable for those other persons to replicate the line or associated facility.
(2B) Subsection (2A) applies—
(a)
to a line or associated facility that is—
(i)
in a building, or
(ii)
between the network termination point as determined by OFCOM and the first concentration or distribution point as so determined; and
(b)
in a case where OFCOM consider, having regard where applicable to any analysis of a services market under section 79, that obligations imposed by virtue of paragraph (a) will not in their opinion sufficiently address high and non-transitory economic or physical barriers to replication which underlie an existing or emerging market situation significantly limiting competitive outcomes for end-users, to a line or associated facility that is outside a building beyond the first concentration or distribution point to a point determined by OFCOM to be the closest point to end-users that is capable of hosting a sufficient number of end-user connections to be commercially viable for those seeking access.
(2C) OFCOM may not apply a condition authorised by virtue of subsection (2B)(b) to a person providing an electronic communications network if—
(a)
the network concerned is not publicly funded and the person providing the network makes available a viable and similar alternative means of reaching end-users by providing any undertaking with access to a very high capacity network on fair, non-discriminatory and reasonable terms and conditions; or
(b)
the obligations would compromise the economic or financial viability of the bringing of a new network into operation.
(2D) The conditions authorised by subsection (2A) may include provision—
(a)
for securing fairness and reasonableness in the way in which requests for entitlements are made and responded to;
(b)
for securing that the obligations contained in the conditions are complied with within the periods and at the times required by or under the conditions;
(c)
requiring the person to whom the condition applies (“the relevant provider”) not to discriminate unduly against particular persons, or against a particular description of persons, in relation to matters connected with the entitlements mentioned in subsection (2A);
(d)
requiring the relevant provider to publish, in such manner as OFCOM may from time to time direct, all such information as they may direct for the purpose of securing transparency in relation to such matters;
(e)
requiring the relevant provider to publish, in such manner as OFCOM may from time to time direct, the terms and conditions on which the relevant provider is willing to enter into a contract giving the entitlements mentioned in subsection (2A);
(f)
requiring the terms and conditions on which the relevant provider is willing to enter into such a contract to include such terms and conditions as may be specified or described in the condition;
(g)
requiring the relevant provider to make such modifications as OFCOM may direct of any offer by that provider which sets out the terms and conditions on which that provider is willing to enter into such a contract;
(h)
imposing rules about the apportionment and recovery of costs.”.
(3) At the end of subsection (3) insert—
““line” means any wire, cable, tube, pipe or similar thing (including its casing or coating) which is designed or adapted for use in connection with the provision of any electronic communications network or electronic communications service.”.

32.  After section 74 insert—
“74A    Access-related conditions in certain cases involving use of radio spectrum
(1) OFCOM may apply a condition falling within subsection (2) to a person who provides an electronic communications network (“the host network”) if it appears to OFCOM that—
(a)
in a particular local area within the United Kingdom (“the relevant area”), access by end-users to electronic communications services which depend on the use of wireless telegraphy is unavailable or severely restricted;
(b)
the unavailability or restriction results from the physical characteristics of the relevant area or from other characteristics of the relevant area that tend to make the bringing into operation of infrastructure uneconomic;
(c)
the provider of the host network has not made network access available on fair and reasonable commercial terms and conditions to other persons providing electronic communications services; and
(d)
when granting or varying the wireless telegraphy licence relating to the host network, OFCOM had made clear the possibility that a requirement to provide network access or to enter into wholesale roaming access agreements might subsequently be imposed.
(2) A condition falling within this subsection is one requiring the provider of the host network—
(a)
to provide network access in relation to network elements which are not active; or
(b)
to enter into wholesale roaming access agreements relating to the relevant area or any part of the relevant area, on such terms and conditions as may be specified or described in the condition, in response to a request meeting specified requirements.
(3) If OFCOM are satisfied as to the matters in subsection (1) but it appears to them that in the circumstances a condition falling within subsection (2) does not suffice to address the situation, OFCOM may also apply a condition requiring the provider of the host network to provide network access in relation to network elements which are active.
(4) The conditions authorised by subsection (2) or (3) may include any provision mentioned in subsection (2D) of section 74, reading references in that subsection to subsection (2A) of that section as references to subsection (2) or (3) of this section (as the case requires).
(5) In exercising their powers under this section, OFCOM must have regard to—
(a)
the need to maximise the coverage and availability of electronic communications services throughout the member States, along major transport paths and in particular territorial areas;
(b)
the desirability of significantly increasing choice, and improving the quality of service, for end-users;
(c)
the desirability of promoting the efficient use of radio spectrum;
(d)
the technical feasibility of network access and associated conditions;
(e)
the extent of infrastructure-based and service-based competition in the market concerned;
(f)
the desirability of promoting technological innovation;
(g)
the need to maintain incentives for investment in infrastructure.
(6) In this section “a wholesale roaming access agreement” means an agreement between the provider of the host network and the provider of a public electronic communications service that depends on the use of wireless telegraphy (“the roaming provider”) for the purpose of enabling public electronic communications services to be provided in the relevant area to the customers of the roaming provider.
74B    Review of access-related conditions
(1) This section applies to a condition set by virtue of section 73(2) or (4A) and applied to a particular person, so long as the condition remains in force, but does not apply to a condition required by section 75(2).
(2) OFCOM must within the specified period review the results of imposing the obligations in question and consider whether the condition should be modified or revoked.
(3) OFCOM must, as soon as reasonably practicable after complying with subsection (2), publish—
(a)
a report on the review, and
(b)
if the review concludes that the condition should be modified or revoked, a notification under section 48(1) or, where section 48A applies, section 48A(3).
(4) In this section “the specified period”, in relation to a condition, means the period of 5 years beginning with the latest of the following days—
(a)
the commencement of this section;
(b)
the date of the most recent notification under section 48(1) setting or modifying the condition;
(c)
the date of the most recent report under subsection (3)(a) in relation to the condition.”.

(a)
that high and non-transitory structural, legal or regulatory barriers to entry are present;
(b)
that there is a market structure which, having regard to the state of infrastructure-based competition and other sources of competition behind the barriers to entry, does not tend towards effective competition within such period as OFCOM determine to be appropriate in relation to the review;

(b)
the dominant provider is not engaged in any of the following—
(i)
the provision of a public electronic communications network to end-users of public electronic communications services;
(ii)
the provision of a public electronic communications service to end-users;
(iii)
the making available of associated facilities to end-users of public electronic communications services.
(2) OFCOM must consider whether the following tests are satisfied in the case of the dominant provider.
(3) The first test is that none of the persons specified in subsection (4) has activities in any retail market for electronic communications services provided to end-users in the member States.
(4) Those persons are—
(a)
the dominant provider;
(b)
any subsidiary undertaking or parent undertaking of the dominant provider;
(c)
any subsidiary undertaking of a parent undertaking of the dominant provider.
(5) The second test is that the dominant provider is not bound to deal with a single and separate undertaking operating downstream that is active in any retail market for electronic communications services provided to end-users, because of an exclusive agreement, or an agreement which amounts in effect to an exclusive agreement.
(6) If OFCOM are satisfied that both those tests are satisfied, OFCOM are not to apply to the dominant provider any SMP condition except one or more of the following—
(a)
a condition authorised by section 87(3);
(b)
a condition authorised by section 87(6)(a);
(c)
a condition which is authorised by section 87(9) and relates to fair and reasonable pricing in connection with the provision of network access to the dominant provider's network.
(7) Subsection (6) does not restrict OFCOM's powers in a case where, by reason of the terms and conditions on which the dominant provider is willing to enter into an access contract, OFCOM conclude that competition problems have arisen or are likely to arise to the detriment of end-users.
(8) The dominant provider must notify OFCOM as soon as reasonably practicable of any change in circumstances relevant to the application of the tests in subsections (3) and (5).
(9) If, as a result of a notification under subsection (8) or otherwise, OFCOM determine that either of the tests in subsections (3) and (5) is no longer satisfied in relation to the dominant provider, OFCOM must consider whether to set or modify SMP conditions applying to the dominant provider.

(2) The dominant provider may notify OFCOM of a proposal to address the competition problems that are identified in the market power determination, or the possible competition problems that are identified in the proposal for a market power determination, by making commitments to provide network access to, or co-investment in, that network.
(3) The proposal must—
(a)
be sufficiently detailed to enable OFCOM to undertake a detailed consideration under subsection (6);
(b)
specify the period during which the dominant provider is willing to be bound by the commitments; and
(c)
comply with such other requirements as OFCOM may publish for the purposes of this subsection.
(4) If the proposal complies with subsection (3), OFCOM must publish a notification of the proposal.
(5) The notification must—
(a)
state that OFCOM are considering whether to accept the proposed commitments;
(b)
set out the effect of the proposal and an initial analysis by OFCOM of the proposal; and
(c)
specify the period within which representations may be made to OFCOM about the proposal and analysis.
(6) OFCOM must—
(a)
consider every representation about the proposal and analysis made to them during the period specified in the notification under subsection (5);
(b)
notify the dominant provider of their opinion—
(i)
that the proposal is adequate to address the competition problems, or possible competition problems, mentioned in subsection (2); or
(ii)
that if specified changes were made the proposal would be adequate to address those problems; or
(iii)
that for specified reasons the proposal is inadequate to address those problems; and
(c)
publish the notification given under paragraph (b).
(7) The dominant provider may then revise the proposal in the light of OFCOM's opinion.
(8) If the dominant provider notifies OFCOM that the dominant provider is willing to implement the proposal, or the proposal as revised under subsection (7), OFCOM may decide to make the commitments binding, for such period as they may specify in the decision.
(9) A decision under subsection (8) (referred to in this Chapter as a “commitments decision”) takes effect on being notified by OFCOM to the dominant provider and published by OFCOM.
(10) The publication of a notification under this section must be in such manner as appears to OFCOM to be appropriate for bringing the notification to the attention of the persons who, in OFCOM's opinion, are likely to be affected by the matters notified.
93B    Notification of proposed commitments relating to very high capacity network
(1) Section 93A has effect subject to the provisions of this section in a case where—
(a)
the dominant provider referred to in section 93A(1) proposes commitments which include a commitment to open up investment in a network to co-investment (“a co-investment commitment”);
(b)
the network is a very high capacity network which consists of optical fibre elements—
(i)
up to the premises of the end-user or, where this is technically impracticable, up to the immediate proximity of those premises; or
(ii)
up to the base station; and
(c)
the bringing into operation of the network was not publicly announced before 21 December 2018;
(d)
the dominant provider has notified OFCOM under subsection (2) of section 93A of a proposal complying with subsection (3) of that section.
(2) OFCOM are not required to publish under section 93A(4) a notification complying with section 93A(5) in relation to the proposed co-investment commitment if in their opinion the proposal does not address all the matters specified in subsection (3) of this section.
(3) In considering the proposed co-investment commitment under section 93A(6), OFCOM must, in particular, consider whether in their opinion the offer to co-invest satisfies the following requirements—
(a)
it is open at any moment during the lifetime of the network to any provider of electronic communications networks or services;
(b)
it would allow other co-investors who are providers of electronic communications networks or services to compete effectively and sustainably in the long term in downstream markets in which the dominant provider is active on terms which include—
(i)
fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms allowing access to the full capacity of the network to the extent that it is subject to co-investment;
(ii)
flexibility in terms of the value and timing of the participation of each co-investor;
(iii)
the possibility of increasing such participation in the future;
(iv)
reciprocal rights awarded by the co-investors after the bringing into operation of the co-invested infrastructure;
(c)
it is made public by the dominant provider in a timely manner and, if the dominant provider is not a wholesale-only undertaking, within such period of not less than 6 months before the bringing into operation of the new network as OFCOM consider appropriate;
(d)
persons seeking access to the network but not participating in the co-investment can benefit from the outset from the same quality, speed, conditions and end-user reach as were available before the bringing into operation of the network;
(e)
it is accompanied by a mechanism of adaptation over time, confirmed by OFCOM in light of developments on the related retail markets, that—
(i)
maintains the incentives to participate in the co-investment; and
(ii)
ensures that persons seeking access at any time have access to the very high capacity elements of the network on transparent and non-discriminatory terms which reflect appropriately the degrees of risk incurred by the respective co-investors at different stages of the bringing into operation of the network and take into account the competitive situation in retail markets;
(f)
it complies with—
(i)
the criteria set out in points (a) to (d) of Annex 4 to the EECC Directive; and
(ii)
any additional criteria that OFCOM consider necessary to ensure accessibility of potential investors to the co-investment and publish for the purposes of this section; and
(g)
it is made in good faith.
(4) OFCOM must, by a commitments decision, make the co-investment commitment binding if—
(a)
in considering the proposal under section 93A(6), they determine that the co-investment commitment—
(i)
satisfies (or, if changes specified under section 93A(6) were made, would satisfy) the requirements in subsection (3); and
(ii)
is adequate (or, if changes so specified were made, would be adequate) to address the competition problems, or possible competition problems, mentioned in section 93A(2); and
(b)
the dominant provider notifies OFCOM under section 93A(8) in relation to the proposal (or, as the case requires, the proposal as revised under section 93A(7)).
(5) In the case of a co-investment commitment, the period specified by OFCOM in a commitments decision must be at least 7 years.
93C    Giving effect to commitments decision
(1) It is the duty of the dominant provider to comply with the commitments specified in a commitments decision during the period specified in the decision.
(2) As soon as practicable after making a commitments decision in a case where SMP services conditions have been applied or would have been applied to the dominant provider, OFCOM must review the appropriateness, having regard to the commitments decision, of the conditions that have been or would have been applied.
(3) In carrying out the review, the matters to which OFCOM are to have regard include—
(a)
evidence regarding the fair and reasonable character of the commitments;
(b)
whether the commitments involve obligations to all market participants;
(c)
whether the commitments promote the timely availability of access under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory conditions, including access to very high capacity networks, before the launch of related retail services;
(d)
the overall adequacy of the commitments to enable sustainable competition on downstream markets and to facilitate co-operative deployment and take-up of very high capacity networks in the interests of end-users.
(4) If, in the case of a commitment made binding as a result of section 93B(4), at least one person has entered into an agreement for co-investment with the dominant provider under the commitments decision, OFCOM must take steps to revoke or modify any SMP services conditions that they consider to be affected by the decision.
(5) Subsection (4) does not apply where, in OFCOM's opinion, the characteristics of the services market to which the determination referred to in section 93A(1) relates are such that, despite the commitments to which effect is given by the commitments decision, the SMP services condition continues to be necessary in order to address significant competition problems.
(6) If as a result of a review under this section OFCOM send a copy of a proposal to any person in accordance with section 48B(2) or 49B(2), OFCOM must also send that person a copy of the commitments decision.
(7) In this section “dominant provider” means the person who made the proposal to which the commitments decision relates.
93D    Modification of commitments
(1) This section applies where a commitments decision has effect in relation to a person who provides a public electronic communications network (“the dominant provider”).
(2) The dominant provider may notify OFCOM of a proposed modification of the commitments that are made binding by the commitments decision.
(3) In a case where OFCOM consider that the modification would not have a material effect, they may make a decision under section 93A(8) relating to the commitments as proposed to be modified.
(4) In any other case, OFCOM must notify the dominant provider of their opinion that the proposed modification would have a material effect; and subsections (2) to (10) of section 93A then apply in relation to the commitments as proposed to be modified.”.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (“the EECC Directive”). The EECC Directive repeals and replaces four previous directives:
Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive),
Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive),
Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive), and
Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive).
Part 1 of Schedule 1 contains amendments of the Communications Act 2003 implementing the EECC Directive. These amendments include, in particular, amendments relating to:
very high capacity networks;
network access;
end-user rights and bundled contracts;
universal service obligations and social tariffs; and
commitments that may be entered into by the provider of a public electronic communications network for the purpose of addressing competition problems.
Part 3 of Schedule 1 contains amendments of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 implementing the EECC Directive, including amendments relating to the efficient use of the radio spectrum.
Part 1 of Schedule 2 contains related amendments of subordinate legislation. These include the omission of certain provisions of regulations previously made under section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 which were due to come into force on IP completion day but are superseded by the amendments made by Schedule 1.
The amendments implementing the EECC Directive come into force on 21 December 2020 (the date specified in Article 124 of the EECC Directive).
The further amendments in Parts 2 and 4 of Schedule 1, Part 2 of Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 come into force on IP completion day. They are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively (in particular under section 8(2)(a) to (c), (e) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Regulation 5 is a temporary provision implementing Article 87 of the EECC Directive until IP completion day by enabling certain universal service requirements to be reviewed.
Regulation 6 is a saving provision relating to existing universal service conditions that require social tariffs.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument. An Explanatory Memorandum and a transposition note are available alongside these Regulations on https://legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations substitute regulation 24(1) of the National Health Service (Performers Lists) (England) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/335).
Currently medical practitioners cannot provide general medical practitioner services for the National Health Service unless they are general medical practitioners on a performers list (“the medical performers list”) maintained by the NHS Commissioning Board. These Regulations change that so that medical practitioners who are not general medical practitioners can provide such services without being on the medical performers list if they are employed by or are registered with bodies designated by the Medical Profession (Responsible Officers) Regulations 2010, or are granted permission to practise as medical practitioners in hospitals owned or managed by such bodies. These are bodies such as NHS bodies, the Department of Health and Social Care and the armed forces.

In accordance with section 2(4) of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 (“the 1999 Act”)(3), the Secretary of State has consulted the Environment Agency, the Natural Resources Body for Wales, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, and such bodies or persons appearing to the Secretary of State to be representative of the interests of local government, industry, agriculture and small businesses, and such other bodies and persons, as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.
Accordingly, the Secretary of State makes these Regulations(4) in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 2 and 7(9) of, and Schedule 1 to, the 1999 Act and by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972.

(2)
1972 c. 68. Section 2(2) was amended by section 27(1) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c. 51) and by section 3(3) of, and Part 1 of the Schedule to, the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c. 7).

And similarly, under paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32), despite the transfer to the Welsh Ministers of functions under section 2 of the 1999 Act so far as exercisable in relation to Wales (except in relation to offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation), those functions continue to be exercisable by the Secretary of State in relation to Wales for such purposes.Citation and commencement

8th January 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/3038) (“the 2012 Regulations”) implement Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32) (“the Directive”).
The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1440) amend the 2012 Regulations to implement the amendments made to the Directive by Directive 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2018 amending Directive 2003/87/EC to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, and Decision (EU) 2015/1814 (OJ L 76, 19.3.2018, p. 3).
These Regulations are made to correct errors in S.I. 2019/1440 and make some additional amendments as a consequence of those corrections. To the extent that S.I. 2019/1440 is already in force, the amendments are made to the 2012 Regulations; and otherwise they are made to S.I. 2019/1440.
These Regulations amend the definition of “the Northern Ireland Regulations” in the 2012 Regulations and correct references to those Regulations in the 2012 Regulations and in S.I. 2019/1440.
These Regulations amend the definition of “the Verification Regulation 2018” in the 2012 Regulations, as amended by S.I. 2019/1440, so that references to that Regulation are consistent throughout the 2012 Regulations.
These Regulations amend the commencement provision in S.I. 2019/1440 so that additional provisions are brought into force before the main coming into force date for that statutory instrument of 1st January 2021 and to provide that the amendments made by that instrument will remain operative for the duration of any implementation period following the UK’s exit from the European Union.
These Regulations correct some cross-references in amendments made by S.I. 2019/1440.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is available with these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

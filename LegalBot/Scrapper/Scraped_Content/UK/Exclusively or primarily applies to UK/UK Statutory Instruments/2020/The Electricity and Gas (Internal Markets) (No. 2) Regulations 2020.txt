subsequently, on or before 1 May every two years afterwards or on such date as the Authority may direct.
25B.2 This Condition applies to an Electricity Distributor operating a continuous area of network that serves 100,000 or more Customers unless the Authority directs otherwise.
Part A: Scope and contents of Network Development Plan
25B.3 The licensee must use reasonable endeavours to ensure that each Network Development Plan published by it covers the investments planned for the next five to ten year period in relation to the 11kV network and above, but it may exclude secondary transformers and all pole mounted transformers. The Network Development Plan must include:
(a)
a description of those parts of the licensee’s Distribution System most suited to new connections and distribution of further quantities of electricity;
(b)
a description of those parts of the licensee’s Distribution System where reinforcement may be required in order to connect new capacity and new loads, including to facilitate the deployment of Electric Vehicle Recharging Points;
(c)
such information as may be necessary for:
(i)
the Electricity System Operator;
(ii)
Electricity Distributors; and
(iii)
Transmission Licensees,
with whose system the licensee’s Distribution System is connected or with whom the licensee interfaces, to ensure the secure and efficient operation, coordination development and interoperability of the interconnected system; and
(d)
the Distribution Flexibility Services or Energy Efficiency Services that the Electricity Distributor reasonably expects to need. This includes:
(i)
demand-side response;
(ii)
energy efficiency;
(iii)
energy storage facilities; or
(iv)
other resources,
that the Electricity Distributor will reasonably expect to use as an alternative to reinforcement.
Part B: Publication of data and information in relation to the Network Development Plan
25B.4 The licensee must publish on its website at the same time as the Network Development Plan, the relevant data and information used to prepare its Network Development Plan, including:
(a)
the methodology used by the licensee in preparing the Network Development Plan;
(b)

(c)
information relating to the Distribution Flexibility Services that the Electricity Distributor reasonably expects to need across the network area in respect of each financial year. This includes:
(i)
demand-side response;
(ii)
energy efficiency;
(iii)
energy storage facilities; and
(iv)
other resources,
that the Electricity Distributor will reasonably expect to use as an alternative to reinforcement; and
(d)
information relating to the expected development of distribution infrastructure in respect of each financial year, including the licensee’s best view of the design and technical characteristics of the development of the system, considering the likely power flows, capacity, location and timing of the development. This should include developments required in order to connect new generation capacity and new loads, including Electric Vehicle Recharging Points. To the extent that information is available to the licensee, this includes possible routing options for new circuits and locations for potential reinforcements.
25B.5 The licensee must provide a copy of the Network Development Plan on request and free of charge to any person.
Part C: Information exclusions
25B.6 The licensee must include the information required by 25B.3 in every Network Development Plan and must publish the relevant data and information referred to in 25B.4 except if it receives the Authority’s consent to:
(a)
omit any details about circuit capacity, power flows, loading, or any other information the disclosure of which would, in the Authority’s view, seriously and prejudicially affect the commercial interests of the licensee or any third party;
(b)
omit any information the disclosure of which would place the licensee in breach of standard condition 42 (independence of the distribution business and restricted use of confidential information).
Part D: Use of the most recent Long-Term Development Statement
25B.7 In preparing the Network Development Plan, the licensee must use the most recent version of the Long-Term Development Statement prepared under standard condition 25 (long term development statement) to ensure that the data and information used for the Network Development Plan is consistent with that used in the Long-Term Development Statement, so that there is a clear progression from the final year of the Long-Term Development Statement to the start of the Network Development Plan.
Part E: Consultation
25B.8 The licensee must:
(a)
consult interested parties on the proposed Network Development Plan for a period of at least 28 days before publishing as required by 25B.1; and

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations modify the standard conditions of licences granted under the Electricity Act 1989 (c. 29) in order to implement, and address matters arising out of or related to, the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (recast) (“the Electricity Directive”). The Schedule to these Regulations modifies the standard conditions of licences granted under the Gas Act 1986 (c. 44) in a limited way to ensure that the relevant aspects of the billing regime are consistent across electricity and gas.
Copies of those standard licence conditions are available for inspection on Ofgem’s Electronic Public Register website: https://epr.ofgem.gov.uk/Document. Indicative versions of the standard licence conditions are also available for inspection at Ofgem’s office at 10 South Colonnade, Canary Wharf, London, E14 4PU.
The Electricity Directive is part of a package of European energy measures collectively referred to as the “Clean Energy Package”.
The Clean Energy Package comprises Regulation (EU) 2019/942 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 establishing a European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (recast); Regulation (EU) 2019/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on the internal market for electricity (recast); Directive 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2019 on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending Directive 2012/27/EU (recast) and five other dossiers(1).
While costs and benefits have been assessed, a full impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations because the impacts are below the threshold required to carry out a full impact assessment.

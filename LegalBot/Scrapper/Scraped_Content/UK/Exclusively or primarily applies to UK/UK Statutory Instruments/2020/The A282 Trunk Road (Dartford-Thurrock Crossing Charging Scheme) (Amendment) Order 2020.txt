6th February 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Part III of the Transport Act 2000 authorises the Secretary of State to make, amend or revoke a trunk road charging scheme in respect of roads for which a strategic highways company is the traffic authority, and which are carried by a bridge, or pass through a tunnel, of at least 600 metres in length. Subject to the exceptions outlined in the Appointment of a Strategic Highways Company Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/376), Highways England Company Limited (company number 9346363) was appointed as the highway authority for all highways within England for which the Secretary of State was the highway authority immediately before that Order, which includes the A282. Highways England Company Limited is also the traffic authority for these roads by virtue of section 121A(1AB) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (c. 27).
The A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Charging Scheme) Order 2013 (“the 2013 Order”) introduced the current charging scheme in respect of the roads carried by the Dartford Crossing. The 2013 Order, by virtue of article 1(2), was to cease to have effect at the end of the period of seven years from 1st October 2013. Article 3 of this Order removes that provision and, instead, provides that the 2013 Order will remain in force indefinitely.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it amends provision relating to a charge and so, by virtue of section 22(4)(a) of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (c. 26), is not a “regulatory provision” for the purpose of the Business Impact Target pursuant to sections 21 and 23 to 25 of that Act. The impact assessment that accompanied the 2013 Order is available on www.legislation.gov.uk, or a hard copy can be obtained from Peter Steele at the Road Investment Strategy Futures Division, Department for Transport, Great Minster House, 33 Horseferry Rd, London, SW1P 4DR.

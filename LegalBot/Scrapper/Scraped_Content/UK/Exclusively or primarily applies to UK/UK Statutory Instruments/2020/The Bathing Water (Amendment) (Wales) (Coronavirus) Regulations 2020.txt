12 May 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Regulations set out below, and in the manner explained, as a result of pressures and work prioritisation related to the virus known as Coronavirus or “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”, which causes the disease known as “COVID-19”.
These Regulations amend regulation 4 of the Bathing Water Regulations 2013 in order to change the start date of the bathing season in Wales for the year 2020.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restrictive covenant is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 of the 1965 Act there is substituted the following section—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.

are so modified as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to compulsory acquisition under article 18, it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A M2 (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B M3 (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on a specified date), 12 M4 (unauthorised entry) and 13 M5 (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 M6 (tenants at will etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 25(3) (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965) is also modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A

1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act (execution of declaration) as applied by article 23 of the Immingham Open Cycle Gas Turbine Order 2020 (application of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981) in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 24(3) of the Immingham Open Cycle Gas Turbine Order 2020 (acquisition of subsoil only) which excludes the acquisition of subsoil only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of three months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of six weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

Expenses and costs
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 42 to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

27.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised development as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 23(3); and/or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.

(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and

(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Cadent becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any specified works carried out by Cadent as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 7 (consent to transfer benefit of order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any specified works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section (3)(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 154.
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) Cadent must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker Cadent must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised.
(6) The undertaker must not commence any maintenance activity (and must not permit the commencement of such maintenance activity) unless and until Cadent is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker or its contractor has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to Cadent that it shall maintain such acceptable insurance for the maintenance period) and Cadent has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker.
(7) In the event that the undertaker fails to comply with sub-paragraph (6), nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall prevent Cadent from seeking injunctive relief (or any other equitable remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(8) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (6) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act.

in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 173(2);and
(b)
in assessing and preparing a design for its apparatus to address and accommodate the proposals of the undertaker whether or not the undertaker proceeds to implement those proposals or alternative or none at all,
provided that if it so prefers Northern Powergrid may abandon apparatus that the undertaker does not seek to remove in accordance with paragraph 173(2) having first decommissioned such apparatus.
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal and, if the apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule has no value, no sum is to be deducted from the amount payable under sub-paragraph (1).
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 185 to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Northern Powergrid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type capacity or dimensions of apparatus or to lay it at the same depth as the existing apparatus being replaced in which case the full costs are to be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 173(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Northern Powergrid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on Northern Powergrid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary courseF30....

Appeals
5.—(1) The undertaker may appeal in the event that—
(a)
the relevant planning authority refuses an application for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order or grants it subject to conditions;
(b)
the relevant planning authority is deemed to have refused an application pursuant to [F3paragraph 2(4)];
(c)
on receipt of a request for further information pursuant to paragraph 3 the undertaker considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the relevant planning authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or
(d)
on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant planning authority notifies the undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the application.
(2) The steps to be followed in the appeal process are as follows—
(a)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning authority and the requirement consultee;
(b)
the Secretary of State must appoint a person to determine the appeal as soon as reasonably practicable after receiving the appeal documentation and must forthwith notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for the appointed person's attention should be sent;
(c)
the relevant planning authority and the requirement consultee (if applicable) must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within ten business days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(d)
the appeal parties must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within ten business days of receipt of written representations pursuant to paragraph (c);
(e)
the appointed person must make his decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 30 business days of the deadline for the receipt of counter-submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (d); and
(f)
the appointment of the person pursuant to paragraph (b) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(3) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable the appointed person to consider the appeal the appointed person must, within five business days of the appointed person's appointment, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required.
(4) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) must be provided by the undertaker to the appointed person, the relevant planning authority and the requirement consultee on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the appointed person within ten business days of the specified date, but otherwise the process and time limits set out in paragraphs (c) to (e) of sub-paragraph (2) apply.
(5) The appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal; or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant planning authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not),
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to him in the first instance.
(6) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits.
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears that there is sufficient material to enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case.
(8) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, unless proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(9) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is deemed to be an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 (requirements) as if it had been given by the relevant planning authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) does not affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person's determination.
(10) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (11) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(11) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to the advice on planning appeals and award costs published on 3 March 2014 by what was then the Department for Communities and Local Government or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

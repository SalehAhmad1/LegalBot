(a)
to the country or territory to which P is proposed to be removed, and
(b)
despite the appeals process in relation to the national security decision not having been begun or not having been exhausted,

(8) If P makes an application under paragraph (7) then the Commission, in determining whether the certificate should be set aside, must apply the principles that would be applied in judicial review proceedings.
(9) The Commission's determination of a review under paragraph (7) is final.
(10) Where P has made and not withdrawn an application under paragraph (7), the Commission may direct that P is not to be removed from the United Kingdom at a time when the review has not been finally determined by the Commission.
(11) Sections 5 and 6 of the 1997 Act apply in relation to reviews under paragraph (7) (and to applicants for such reviews) as they apply in relation to appeals under section 2 or 2B of that Act (and to persons bringing such appeals).
(12) Any exercise of the power to make rules under section 5 of that Act in relation to reviews under paragraph (7) is to be made with a view to securing that proceedings on such reviews are handled expeditiously.
(13) For the purposes of this regulation—
“human rights claim” has the meaning given in section 113(1) of the 2002 Act;

S.I. 2014/2604, to which there are amendments not relevant to this instrument.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument is made under Part 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1) (“the 2020 Act”). It is the first instrument to be made under section 11 of that Act.
These Regulations make provision for appeals in connection with various immigration decisions which relate to, or are connected to, leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom granted under residence scheme immigration rules or relevant entry clearance immigration rules. “Residence scheme immigration rules” and “relevant entry clearance immigration rules” are defined in section 17 of the 2020 Act.
Part 1 of these Regulations contains general provisions.
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision for the relevant appeals.
Chapter 1 of that Part sets out the rights of appeal in connection with the immigration decisions mentioned above, the grounds on which an appeal may be brought and the matters to be determined by the appeal body.
An appeal under these Regulations must generally be made to the First-tier Tribunal (“the Tribunal”). However, if an appeal is certified by the Secretary of State under Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations, the appeal must be made to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (“the Commission”) (regulation 7). An appeal may be certified, for example, in the interests of national security or the public interest. Any appeal which is certified after the relevant proceedings in the Tribunal have started will lapse automatically (paragraph 3 of Schedule 1). The appeal must then be made to the Commission.
Part 2 of Schedule 1 to the Regulations applies various provisions of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (c. 68) and the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (c.41) (“the 2002 Act”) (with modifications) for the purposes of appeals to the Commission.
Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the Regulations makes specific provision in connection with appeals before the Tribunal. Various provisions of the 2002 Act are applied (with modifications) for the purposes of appeals to the Tribunal (regulation 11 and Schedule 2). Provision is also made for an appellant who has brought an appeal from outside the United Kingdom to, in certain circumstances, apply to the Secretary of State to be admitted on bail to the United Kingdom in order to make submissions in person in connection with an appeal (regulation 12 and Schedule 3).
Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Regulations deals with procedural matters relevant to appeals before both the Tribunal and the Commission. Regulation 13 sets out when an appeal under these Regulations is to be treated as pending. Regulations 14 to 16 make provision about the place from which appeals may be brought and certification.
Part 3 of the Regulations makes various amendments to primary and secondary legislation in consequence of the provisions made by the Regulations.

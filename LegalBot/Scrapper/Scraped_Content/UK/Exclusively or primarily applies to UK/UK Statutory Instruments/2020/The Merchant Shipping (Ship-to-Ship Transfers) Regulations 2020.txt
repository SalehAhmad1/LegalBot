(a)
on receipt of a written application for authorisation,
(b)
in advance of a cargo transfer, and
(c)
in writing.Oil transfer licences
8.—(1) Before a harbour authority may obtain an oil transfer licence, the harbour authority must—

determine, in accordance with the procedure in Schedule 1 (initial determination of likely effects on European sites), whether the cargo transfers to be authorised pursuant to the licence would be likely to have a significant effect on any European site; and
(b)
apply for the licence to the Secretary of State in accordance with the procedure in Schedule 2 (procedure for grant of an oil transfer licence).
(2) Subject to regulation 9(2) (transitional provisions), in harbour authority waters where—
(a)
an oil transfer licence has effect, and
(b)
the harbour authority which regulates or manages those harbour authority waters becomes aware of circumstances which render the information provided in the OTL application inaccurate to what is or may be a material extent,
the harbour authority must apply to the Secretary of State for an amended oil transfer licence.
(3) The harbour authority must make the application under paragraph (2) within 3 months of becoming aware of the circumstances referred to in that paragraph.
(4) A harbour authority applying for an amended oil transfer licence must use the procedure in Schedules 1 (initial determination of likely effects on European sites) and 2 (procedure for grant of an oil transfer licence), and for this purpose references in Schedules 1 and 2—
(a)
to the oil transfer licence are to be taken as references to the amended oil transfer licence;
(b)
to the OTL application are to be taken as references to the application for the amended oil transfer licence; and

(a)
a harbour authority should have made an application under paragraph (2); and
(b)
that harbour authority has not made the application within the time period specified in paragraph (3),
the Secretary of State may suspend an oil transfer licence until the application has been made and a decision has been made regarding the action to take as a result of the application.
(7) Where the Secretary of State suspends an oil transfer licence in accordance with paragraph (6), the Secretary of State must immediately give notice of the suspension in writing to the harbour authority.Transitional provisions
9.—(1) If a harbour authority was granted an oil transfer licence under regulation 5 (oil transfer licences) of the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010(1) then, for the purposes of these Regulations, that harbour authority shall be treated as though that oil transfer licence was granted under regulation 8 (oil transfer licences).
(2) In harbour authority waters where—
(a)
an oil transfer licence has effect by virtue of paragraph (1) at the time at which these Regulations come into force, and
(b)
the harbour authority which regulates or manages those harbour authority waters is aware, at that time, of circumstances which render the information provided in the original application for an oil transfer licence under regulation 5(1) (oil transfer licences) of the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010 inaccurate to what is or might be a material extent,
the harbour authority must apply to the Secretary of State for an amended oil transfer licence.
(3) The harbour authority must make the application under paragraph (2) within three months of the date on which these Regulations come into force.
(4) Regulation 8(4) to (7) (oil transfer licences) apply to an application under paragraph (2) as they would to an application under regulation 8(2).
(5) If, prior to the coming into force of these Regulations, a harbour authority authorised a cargo transfer that is scheduled to take place after the Regulations come into force, that authorisation is to be treated as an authorisation for the purposes of these Regulations and remains valid provided that—
(a)
when carried out, the cargo transfer is within the scope permitted by the harbour authority’s oil transfer licence; and
(b)
the requirements of regulation 7(2) (authorisation of cargo transfers) were satisfied in relation to the authorisation.

(2) The Secretary of State may make any such exemption subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.
(3) Where the Secretary of State considers that a cargo transfer or bunkering operation is likely to have a significant effect on a European site, the Secretary of State must, before granting an exemption under paragraph (1), require the person applying for the exemption to provide sufficient information to enable the Secretary of State to carry out an appropriate assessment of the implications of the cargo transfer or bunkering operation for the European site, in view of the conservation objectives of the site.
(4) The procedure for the assessment referred to in paragraph (3) is the procedure for assessment of an OTL application in Schedules 1 (initial determination of likely effects on European sites) and 2 (procedure for grant of an oil transfer licence), and for this purpose references in Schedules 1 and 2—
(a)
to the harbour authority are to be taken as references to the person who applied for the exemption;
(b)
to the OTL application are to be taken as references to the application for the exemption;
(c)
to the oil transfer licence are to be taken as references to the proposed exempt cargo transfer or bunkering operation; and

SCHEDULE 1
Initial Determination of Likely Effects on European Sites
1.  The harbour authority must—
(a)
determine, and
(b)
provide to the Secretary of State a written statement with reasons specifying,
whether the cargo transfers to be carried out under the requested oil transfer licence are likely to have a significant effect on any European site, either individually or in combination with other plans or projects.
2.—(1) If the harbour authority determines that the cargo transfers are not likely to have a significant effect on any European site, the Secretary of State must, on receipt of the OTL application, review that determination in the light of the environmental statement and any further information provided.
(2) If, following such review, the Secretary of State determines that the cargo transfers are likely to have a significant effect on any European site, the Secretary of State must give notice to the harbour authority to that effect.
3.—(1) If the harbour authority or the Secretary of State has determined that the cargo transfers are likely to have a significant effect on any European site, the procedure set out in Schedule 2 (procedure for grant of an oil transfer licence) shall be modified as follows.
(2) Having considered the environmental statement, the Secretary of State must make an appropriate assessment of the implications of the proposed cargo transfers for the European site, in view of the conservation objectives of the site, for the purposes of Article 5 of the Habitats Directive.
(3) Before the Secretary of State may grant an oil transfer licence without having concluded that the proposed cargo transfers will not adversely affect a European site, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that—
(a)
there is no appropriate alternative to granting the oil transfer licence in the proposed terms, and
(b)
the oil transfer licence must be granted in view of imperative reasons of overriding public interest which, subject to sub-paragraph (4), may be of a social or economic nature.
(4) Where the European site referred to in sub-paragraph (3) hosts a priority natural habitat type or a priority species as defined in Article 1 of the Habitats Directive, the reasons referred to in that sub-paragraph must be either—
(a)
reasons relating to human health, public safety or beneficial consequences of primary importance to the environment; or
(b)
reasons which are, in the opinion of the appropriate authority, imperative reasons of overriding public interest.
(5) Before IP completion day, when considering an OTL application the Secretary of State may seek the opinion of the European Commission in connection with sub-paragraph (4)(b).
(6) Where the Secretary of State considers that any adverse effects of the proposed cargo transfers on the integrity of a European site would be avoided by granting an oil transfer licence subject to conditions, the Secretary of State must not grant the licence except subject to those conditions.
(7) If, in spite of a negative assessment of the environmental implications for the European site and in the absence of alternative solutions, the Secretary of State decides to grant the oil transfer licence for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, the Secretary of State must—
(a)
ensure that all compensatory measures necessary to ensure the overall coherence of Natura 2000 are taken; and
(b)
if the decision is made before IP completion day, inform the European Commission of the compensatory measures adopted.Regulation 8(1)(b) and (4) and 11(4)

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations govern transfers consisting wholly or mainly of oil between ships, known as ship-to-ship transfers. The two types of ship-to-ship transfer which are governed within the Regulations are cargo transfers and bunkering operations.
The Regulations prohibit cargo transfers unless they are carried out within harbour authority waters or within the permit area (regulation 4). They also provide that cargo transfers must not be carried out within harbour authority waters unless they are authorised by the harbour authority or the cargo transfer is a lightening operation (to lighten the ship to enable it to move to shallower waters) or a consolidation operation (to consolidate cargo for bunkering operations) (regulation 5).
The relevant harbour authority may provide authorisation under an oil transfer licence granted by the Secretary of State, having considered the programme’s likely impact on the environment by the procedure set out in Schedules 1 and 2. Where cargo transfers are likely to have a significant effect on a European site, the procedure implements Article 6 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (O.J. No. L 206, 22.07.1992, p. 7), which will continue to apply to the United Kingdom during the implementation period.
A harbour authority may only authorise a cargo transfer which is within the scope permitted by the harbour authority’s oil transfer licence (regulation 7). If a harbour authority becomes aware of a material change in circumstances following the grant of their oil transfer licence, they are required to apply for an amendment to the existing licence within three months (regulation 8).
There are transitional provisions in the Regulations (regulation 9) which provide that oil transfer licences granted under the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1228) are to be treated as though they have been granted under these Regulations. A harbour authority must apply for an amended oil transfer licence within three months, if they are aware of a change of circumstances when the Regulations come into force. Any authorisation that a harbour authority provided prior to the Regulations coming into force for a cargo transfer to be carried out after the Regulations come into force, will be treated as valid for the purposes of these Regulations provided that certain criteria are met. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime.
The Regulations prohibit ship-to-ship cargo transfers of oil to or from a ship of 150GT or more in controlled waters, unless prior notice has been given to the Secretary of State (regulation 4). A ship involved in a transfer to or from a ship of 150GT or more is also required to carry and comply with a ship-to-ship transfer operations plan approved by its flag State, if the transfer is carried out within United Kingdom waters or controlled waters (regulation 4). These provisions implement Chapter 8 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (“MARPOL”).
Bunkering operations in United Kingdom waters are prohibited, unless the ships carrying out the operation are within harbour authority waters (regulation 10).
The Secretary of State can grant exemptions in relation to prohibited cargo transfers and bunkering operations (regulation 11).
The Regulations provide that carrying out a cargo transfer or bunkering operation in contravention of the Regulations is an offence by the owner, manager and master of each ship involved in the transfer or operation and the Regulations also set out the offences which apply to harbour authorities (regulation 12).
A consequential amendment is made to the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/1012) (regulation 13). The amendment simply substitutes a reference to the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1228) with a reference to these Regulations.
The Secretary of State must review the operation and effect of these Regulations and publish a report within five years after they come into force and within every five years thereafter (regulation 14). Following such a review, it will fall to the Secretary of State to consider whether the Regulations should remain as they are, or be revoked or amended. A further instrument would be needed to revoke the Regulations or to amend them.

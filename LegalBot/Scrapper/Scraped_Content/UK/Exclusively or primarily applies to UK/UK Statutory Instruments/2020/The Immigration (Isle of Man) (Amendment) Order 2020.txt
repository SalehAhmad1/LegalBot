Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Immigration (Isle of Man) Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/680). It makes amendments to Isle of Man immigration legislation which are equivalent to amendments previously made to UK immigration legislation, thus maintaining the Isle of Man’s integrated approach to immigration policy with the United Kingdom.
The effect of these amendments is principally to ensure that the offence of facilitating illegal immigration is maintained when the United Kingdom leaves the European Union; to clarify the conditions to be met for the removal of family members from the Isle of Man of a person who has no right of abode in the Isle of Man; to amend the definitions of “sham marriage” and “sham civil partnership”; and to give a definition of a “retained enforceable EU right”.
This Order also makes saving and transitional provisions in relation to immigration and nationality.

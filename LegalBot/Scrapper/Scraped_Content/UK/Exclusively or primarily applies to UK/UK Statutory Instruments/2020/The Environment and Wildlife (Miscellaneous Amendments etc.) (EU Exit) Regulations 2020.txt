Goldsmith of Richmond Park
Minister of State
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
30th November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in part in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and correct other deficiencies (in particular under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (e) and (g) of section 8(2) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. They are also made in part in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8C of that Act to implement the Northern Ireland Protocol and by section 41 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c.1).
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora, and in particular amend legislation relating to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). CITES controls the import, export and movement of protected flora and fauna, including dead or living controlled species as well as parts or derivatives (e.g. skin, fur, teeth, shell, feathers or blood and parts of some plants, for example, seeds). Part 2 both amends and revokes relevant subordinate legislation and Part 3 amends retained direct EU legislation (EU Regulations) in this field.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

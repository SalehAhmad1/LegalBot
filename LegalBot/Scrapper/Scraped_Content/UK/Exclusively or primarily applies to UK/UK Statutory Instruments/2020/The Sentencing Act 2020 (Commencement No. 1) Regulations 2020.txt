2nd November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Sentencing Act 2020 (c. 17) (“the Act”) comes into force, by virtue of section 416(1), on 1st December 2020. As a result, the Sentencing Code (Parts 2 to 13 of the Act) will come into force on that date. But section 416(1) is subject to the exceptions in section 416(4), by virtue of which Schedules 22 and 26, which reproduce uncommenced amendments of legislation reproduced in the Sentencing Code and the Armed Forces Act 2006 (c. 52), will not come into force on 1st December 2020 and instead will come into force in accordance with sections 417 and 418.
Regulations 3 and 4 amend the Act so that references to the commencement date are replaced with the actual date on which the Act comes into force where appropriate. The power to do this is in section 104 of the Deregulation Act 2015 (c. 20).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply with the necessary modifications as respects compensation in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the following modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enter on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 4 to the Network Rail (London to Corby)(Land Acquisition) Order 2020 (“the 2020 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 4 to the 2020 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enter on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for the words “land is acquired or taken” substitute “a right over land is purchased”; and
(b)
for the words “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 5 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 4 (power to acquire land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of rights under article 7(1) or (2) (power to acquire new rights)—
(a)
with the modification specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in the case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—

(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land);
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 5(1)), it has power, exercisable in the equivalent circumstances and subject to the equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 5(7)) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—

7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.

(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—

(b)
the proposed use of the right to be acquired, and
(c)

12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

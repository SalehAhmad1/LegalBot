17th March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends section 99(3) of the Gambling Act 2005 (“the Act”).
Section 99 of the Act specifies certain requirements to which the Gambling Commission must give effect by attaching conditions to a lottery operating licence issued to a non-commercial society (defined in section 19 of the Act) or a local authority.
The requirements in section 99(3) impose monetary limits on the proceeds of any lottery promoted in reliance on a lottery operating licence, and also on the aggregate proceeds of lotteries promoted wholly or partly in a calendar year in reliance on a lottery operating licence.
Article 2 of this Order increases those monetary limits. The transitional provisions in article 3 ensure that lottery operating licence holders can benefit on a pro rata basis from the increase in the revised limit on the annual aggregate proceeds in section 99(3)(b) of the Act as soon as the Gambling Commission alters the conditions attached to lottery operating licences to reflect the revised limit. Without this, the revised limit on the annual aggregate proceeds put in place by article 2(3) could not apply until the beginning of the next calendar year.
An impact assessment which analyses the effect that this Order will have on the costs of business and the voluntary and the public sectors has been produced by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The impact assessment and the Explanatory Memorandum are available online alongside this instrument on legislation.gov.uk and copies can be obtained from the Department at 100 Parliament Street, London SW1A 2BQ.

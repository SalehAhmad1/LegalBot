3rd March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Insolvency Act 1986 (Prescribed Part) Order 2003/2097 sets out the method of calculation of the prescribed part and is subject to a limit. The prescribed part is the part of the property of a company that a liquidator, administrator or receiver must reserve for unsecured creditors, under section 176A of the Insolvency Act 1986, and which would otherwise be available to satisfy claims secured by a floating charge.
This Order increases the limit on the value of the prescribed part from £600,000 to £800,000.
The increased limit does not apply where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking floating charge created before this Order comes into force.
A full impact assessment has not been published for this instrument as it has minimal impact on the private, voluntary or public sector.

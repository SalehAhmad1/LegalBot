(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2, paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Schedule to the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018 (c. 24) (“the 2018 Act”) inserted a new Part 12ZD into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (c. 4) (“the 1992 Act”). This created an entitlement to statutory parental bereavement pay. The 2018 Act does not apply or extend to Northern Ireland.
Part 2, paragraphs 30 and 31 of the 2018 Act also amended sections 8 and 11 of the 1992 Act respectively, so as to provide for officers of Revenue and Customs to make decisions regarding statutory parental bereavement pay, and for such decisions to be appealed. As a result, these Regulations make consequential amendments to secondary legislation to insert references to statutory parental bereavement pay into provisions that govern the making of these decisions and any subsequent appeal.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared for these Regulations as they are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessment is the “Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Bill impact assessment” which was published on 14th May 2018. An addendum to the impact assessment was also published on 24th May 2018. Copies of these two documents are available at: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2017-2019/0105/Impact%20Assessment%20-%20Parental%20Bereavement%20-%20amended%20200113.pdf and https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2017-2019/0105/18105-impact-assessment-addendum.pdf respectively. Paper copies of both impact assessments can be obtained from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, Westminster, London SW1H 0ET, and copies have also been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

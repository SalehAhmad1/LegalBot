16.  The waste prevention measures referred to in regulation 5(c)(iii) are measures to—
(a)
promote and support sustainable production and consumption models;
(b)
encourage the design, manufacturing and use of products that are resource-efficient, durable (including in terms of life span and absence of planned obsolescence), reparable, re-usable and upgradable;
(c)
target products containing critical raw materials to prevent those materials becoming waste;
(d)
encourage the re-use of products and the setting up of systems promoting repair and re-use activities, including in particular for—
(i)
electrical and electronic equipment;
(ii)
textiles;
(iii)
furniture
(iv)
packaging; and
(v)
construction materials and products;
(e)
encourage, as appropriate and without prejudice to intellectual property rights, the availability of spare parts, instruction manuals, technical information, or other instruments, equipment or software enabling the repair and re-use of products without compromising their quality and safety;
(f)
reduce waste generation in processes related to industrial production, extraction of minerals, manufacturing, construction and demolition, taking into account best available techniques;
(g)
reduce the generation of food waste in primary production, in processing and manufacturing, in retail and other distribution of food, in restaurants and food services as well as in households;
(h)
encourage food donation and other redistribution for human consumption, prioritising human use over animal feed and the reprocessing into non-food products;
(i)
promote the reduction of the content of hazardous substances in materials and products;
(j)
reduce the generation of waste, in particular waste that is not suitable for preparing for re-use or recycling;
(k)
identify products that are the main sources of littering and take appropriate measures to prevent and reduce litter from such products;
(l)
aim to halt the generation of marine litter; and
(m)
develop and support information campaigns to raise awareness about waste prevention and littering.
Part 6
Examples of economic instruments and other measures to provide incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy
17.  The economic instruments and other measures referred to in paragraph 2(3) of this Schedule and regulation 5(c)(iv) are—
(a)
charges and restrictions for the landfilling and incineration of waste which incentivise waste prevention and recycling, while keeping landfilling the least preferred waste management option;
(b)
‘pay-as-you-throw’ schemes that charge waste producers on the basis of the actual amount of waste generated and provide incentives for separation at source of recyclable waste and for reduction of mixed waste;
(c)
fiscal incentives for donation of products, in particular food;
(d)
extended producer responsibility schemes for various types of waste and measures to increase their effectiveness, cost efficiency and governance;
(e)
deposit-refund schemes and other measures to encourage efficient collection of used products and materials;
(f)
sound planning of investments in waste management infrastructure;
(g)
sustainable public procurement to encourage better waste management and the use of recycled products and materials;
(h)
phasing out of subsidies which are not consistent with the waste hierarchy;
(i)
use of fiscal measures or other means to promote the uptake of products and materials that are prepared for re-use or recycled;
(j)
support to research and innovation in advanced recycling technologies and remanufacturing;
(k)
use of best available techniques for waste treatment;
(l)
economic incentives for regional and local authorities, in particular to promote waste prevention and intensify separate collection schemes, while avoiding support to landfilling and incineration;
(m)
public awareness campaigns, in particular on separate collection, waste prevention and litter reduction, and mainstreaming these issues in education and training;
(n)
systems for coordination, including by digital means, between all competent public authorities involved in waste management;
(o)
promoting continuous dialogue and cooperation between all stakeholders in waste management and encouraging voluntary agreements and company reporting on waste.”.

25th August 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement for England and Wales, and partially implement for Scotland and Northern Ireland, 6 amending EU Directives in the field of waste, namely Directive (EU) 2018/849 (OJ No L 150, 14.6.2018, p. 93), Directive (EU) 2018/850 (OJ No L 150, 14.6.2018, p. 100), Directive (EU) 2018/851 (OJ No L 150, 14.6.2018, p. 109), Directive (EU) 2018/852 (OJ No L 150, 14.6.2018, p. 141), Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2020/362 (OJ No L 67, 5.3.2020, p. 116) and Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2020/363 (OJ L No 67, 5.3.2020, p. 119) (“the amending Directives”).
The amending Directives amend 6 EU Directives; European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (OJ No L 365, 31.12.1994, p. 10), Council Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste (OJ No L 182, 16.7.1999, p. 1), Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on end-of life vehicles (OJ No L 269, 21.10.2000, p. 34), Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators (OJ No L 266, 26.9.2006, p. 1), Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste (OJ No L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3) (“the Waste Framework Directive”) and Directive 2012/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) (OJ No L 197, 24.7.2012, p. 38) (“the relevant Directives”).
Part 2 of these Regulations amends primary legislation to update references to the Waste Framework Directive in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the Environment Act 1995, the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003 and the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. It also amends the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003 in relation to definitions in Article 3 of the Waste Framework Directive.
Part 3 of these Regulations amends subordinate legislation. Regulation 9 amends the Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) Regulations, as amended, which implement hazardous waste requirements in the Waste Framework Directive in England. Regulation 15 amends the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011, as amended, which partially implement the Waste Framework Directive in England and Wales. Regulation 19 amends the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2015, as amended, which partially implement Directive 94/62/EC in the UK.
Regulation 21 amends the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”), as amended, which partially implement the relevant Directives in England and Wales. Paragraphs (2) to (6) amend the 2016 Regulations to implement the amending Directives. Paragraph (7) amends the 2016 Regulations to implement obligations relating to the management of waste from extractive industries in England and Wales in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2020/248 laying down technical guidelines for inspections in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2006/21/EC (OJ L No 51, 25.2.2020, p. 4).
The remaining provisions of Part 3 update references to the relevant Directives in subordinate legislation relating to packaging waste, end-of-life vehicles, waste batteries and accumulators and waste electrical and electronic equipment and also updates references to the Waste Framework Directive in relation to the definition of waste in other subordinate legislation.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

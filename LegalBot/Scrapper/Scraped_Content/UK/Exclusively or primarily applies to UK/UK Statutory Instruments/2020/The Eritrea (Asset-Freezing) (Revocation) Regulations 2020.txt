(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Eritrea (Asset-Freezing) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/1515) as the EU Regulation on which they are based has been repealed.
The Eritrea (Asset-Freezing) Regulations 2012 implemented in the United Kingdom Council Regulation (EU) 667/2010 (OJ L 195, 27.7.2010, p.16), which concerned restrictive measures in respect of Eritrea.
Council Regulation (EU) 2018/1932 (OJ L 314, 11.12.2018, p.8) repealed Council Regulation (EU) 667/2010, meaning that the UK implementing Regulations may now be revoked.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

Reg. 17 in force at 31.12.2020 on IP completion day, see reg. 1(2)(3)Decisions taken on grounds of public policy, public security and public health
18.—(1) In this regulation, a “relevant decision” means a decision taken under these Regulations on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health.
(2) A relevant decision may not be taken to serve economic ends.
(3) A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative grounds of public security in respect of a frontier worker who is under the age of 18, unless the relevant decision is in the best interests of the person concerned, as provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20th November 1989 M1.
(4) The public policy and public security requirements of the United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise conferred by these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental interests of society, and where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be taken in accordance with the following principles—
(a)
the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;
(b)
the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct of the person concerned;
(c)
the personal conduct of the person must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society, taking into account past conduct of the person and that the threat does not need to be imminent;
(d)
matters isolated from the particulars of the case or which relate to considerations of general prevention do not justify the decision;
(e)
a person's previous criminal convictions do not in themselves justify the decision; and
(f)
the decision may be taken on preventative grounds, even in the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the grounds are specific to the person.
(5) Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public policy or public security in relation to a frontier worker (“P”) the decision maker must take account of considerations such as the age, state of health, family and economic situation of P, P's length of presence in the United Kingdom, P's social and cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of P's links with P's country of origin.
(6) In the case of a relevant decision taken on grounds of public health—
(a)
a disease that does not have epidemic potential as defined by the relevant instruments of the World Health Organisation or is not a disease listed in Schedule 1 to the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 M2; or
(b)
if the person concerned is in the United Kingdom, any disease occurring after the three month period beginning on the date on which the person arrived in the United Kingdom,
does not constitute grounds for the decision.

Sch. para. 7 in force at 31.12.2020 on IP completion day, see reg. 1(2)(3)EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provisions for frontier workers in order to fulfil the United Kingdom's obligations under the withdrawal agreement, the EEA EFTA separation agreement and the Swiss citizens' rights agreement (see section 39 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 for definitions of each of these agreements).
These Regulations provide for EEA nationals who, by 31 December 2020, are working or self-employed in the United Kingdom but living elsewhere (“frontier workers”) to continue to work in the United Kingdom for as long as they remain a frontier worker. These Regulations also provide for the restriction of those rights and establishes a scheme for frontier worker permits.
Part 1 (preliminary: regulations 1 to 4) defines the personal scope of these Regulations and the terms used throughout. Regulation 3 defines ‘frontier worker’ and regulation 4 sets out the circumstances in which a person is to be treated as a frontier worker during a temporary break from work or self-employment.
Part 2 (frontier worker rights: regulations 5 to 7) establishes that frontier workers are exempt from the need to have leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom while entering or remaining for the purpose of frontier working, unless subject to a relevant restriction decision defined in regulation 2. Regulation 6 provides for the right of admission to the United Kingdom subject to certain conditions.
Part 3 (frontier worker permit: regulations 8 to 11) establishes a scheme for frontier worker permits, which evidence frontier workers' rights under these Regulations and, after 30 June 2021, are necessary for a frontier worker to be admitted to the United Kingdom as a frontier worker. Regulation 8 sets out the process for applying for a frontier worker permit. Permits will be valid for 2 or 5 years and will be renewable indefinitely under regulation 11. An application for a permit, or renewal of a permit, may be refused or a permit revoked on grounds set out in this Part.
Part 4 (refusal of admission and removal: regulations 12 to 20) sets out the circumstances in which frontier workers' rights may be restricted. Frontier workers may be removed from the United Kingdom on public policy, public security or public health grounds for conduct committed before the end of the implementation period under regulation 18, and where conducive to the public good for conduct committed thereafter under regulation 19. Frontier workers may also be removed where they have misused their frontier workers' rights under regulation 20.
Regulations 21 to 23 provide a right to apply for administrative review of eligible decisions, defined in regulation 21. Regulations 24 to 26 provide rights of appeal against decisions taken under these Regulations by amending the Immigration (Citizens' Rights Appeals) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020. Subject to certain conditions, a person can appeal against a decision to refuse to issue, renew or revoke a frontier worker permit; refuse or revoke their admission; or remove or deport them from the United Kingdom.
Part 6 (consequential amendments: regulations 27 and 28) allows for biometric information to be taken in frontier worker permit applications and excludes frontier workers from the restrictions imposed by Article 4 of the Immigration (Control of Entry through Republic of Ireland) Order 1972.

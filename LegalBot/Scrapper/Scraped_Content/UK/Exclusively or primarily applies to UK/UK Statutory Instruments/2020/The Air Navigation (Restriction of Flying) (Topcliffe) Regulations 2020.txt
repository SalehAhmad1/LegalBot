EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Topcliffe, North Yorkshire 
because of the use of an unlit and unmarked, tethered balloon for a military exercise which is 
scheduled to take place during the period 6th September to 18th September 2020 (inclusive). As 
the operation does not allow the balloon, or its tether to be lit or marked, the Civil Aviation 
Authority and Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in the vicinity of 
Topcliffe on the grounds of flight safety. 
In relation to regulations 3, the term ‘aircraft’ includes aircraft as classified by Part 1 of Schedule 
4 to the Air Navigation Order 2016. It also includes, by virtue of article 23 of that Order, any 
small balloon, any kite weighing not more than two kilograms, any small unmanned aircraft and 
any parachute including a parascending parachute. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC), which for the 
purpose of these regulations is one hour behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(a), the Flight Control Officer, 2 Signal 
Squadron, 32 Signal Regiment may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of the Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice To Airmen (NOTAM).

Regulator, Safety and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 382997.

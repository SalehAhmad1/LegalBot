Regulation 12(4) of the 2011 Regulations is amended to make it clear that official fish inspectors are responsible for decisions relating to composite products containing processed fishery products.
Regulations 20(7) and 23(6) of the 2011 Regulations relate to cases where non-compliant products and animals are required to be treated, re-dispatched or destroyed.

The amendments to these provisions ensure that the importer or importer’s representative is not entitled to any payment following their destruction.

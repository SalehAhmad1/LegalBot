(a)
in a court in which these Rules apply; and
(b)
by a person authorised for the purpose by the Lord Chief Justice under section 67B of that Act(2).
(2) In this rule and in rules 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9―
(a)
‘authorised court officer’ means any such person; and
(b)
a reference to an authorised court officer who is legally qualified is a reference to one who has such qualifications as are for the time being prescribed by regulations made under section 28(3) of the Courts Act 2003.
(3) No court officer may―
(a)
authorise a person’s committal to prison;
(b)
authorise a person’s arrest (but that exclusion does not apply to the issue of a warrant of arrest, whether or not endorsed for bail, to secure that a person attends court proceedings relating to an offence of which the person has been accused or convicted in a case in which no objection is made by or on behalf of that person to the issue of the warrant);
(c)
grant or withhold bail, except to the extent that rule 2.6 or rule 2.8 allows;
(d)
adjudicate on guilt, or on the act or omission with which a defendant is charged, except to the extent of―
(i)
acquitting a defendant against whom the prosecutor offers no evidence,
(ii)
convicting a defendant who pleads guilty, or
(iii)
giving a prosecutor permission to withdraw a case;
(e)
determine the admissibility of evidence;
(f)

(j)
vary, discharge, remit, remove, revoke, review or suspend a sentence, penalty or other order consequent on acquittal or conviction, except to the extent that rule 2.8 allows;
(k)
order the search, confiscation, restraint, detention or seizure of property except to the extent that rule 2.8 allows;
(l)
determine an appeal or reference to an appeal court, or an application for permission to appeal or refer, except to the extent that rule 2.6 allows; or

(a)
only subject to the same conditions as apply to its exercise by the court or person whose function it is; and
(b)
where a party affected by the exercise of that function is entitled to make representations before its exercise, only if each such party has had a reasonable opportunity to make such representations―
(i)
in writing, or

at a hearing (whether or not that party in fact attends).
(5) Unless the context makes it clear that something different is meant, provision in rule 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 or 2.9 permitting the exercise of a relevant judicial function by an authorised court officer includes a power to decline to exercise that function.
[Note. Under section 67A of the Courts Act 2003, ‘relevant judicial function’ means a function of a court to which the general duty of the Lord Chancellor under section 1 of that Act applies and a judicial function of a person holding an office that entitles the person to exercise functions of such a court, but does not include in a court in which Criminal Procedure Rules apply―

Under section 67B of the 2003 Act, in a court in which Criminal Procedure Rules apply the Rules may provide for the exercise of relevant judicial functions by persons who are appointed under section 2(1) of that Act and who satisfy any requirements specified in the Rules as to qualifications or experience. Such a person may exercise such a function only if authorised to do so by the Lord Chief Justice.
Section 28 of the 2003 Act provides for persons authorised by the Lord Chief Justice to give advice to justices of the peace about matters of law. Such a person may be authorised for that purpose only if appointed under section 2(1) of that Act and possessed of such qualifications as may be prescribed by regulations made under section 28. See also rule 2.2 (Definitions).]

2.12.—(1) This rule applies in relation to a magistrates’ court, including a youth court, that comprises a lay justice or lay justices.

to understand what the court requires and why;
(b)

See Part 9 (Allocation and sending for trial) for the procedure. The decision depends upon—
(a) the classification of the offence (and the general rule, subject to exceptions, is that an offence classified as triable only on indictment must be sent to the Crown Court for trial; an offence classified as triable only summarily must be tried in a magistrates’ court; and an offence classified as triable either way, on indictment or summarily, must be allocated to one or the other court for trial, subject to the defendant’s right to choose Crown Court trial: see in particular sections 50A, 51 and 51A of the 1998 Act(2) and section 19 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(3));
(b) the defendant’s age (and the general rule, subject to exceptions, is that an offence alleged against a defendant under 18 must be tried in a magistrates’ court sitting as a youth court: see in particular sections 24 and 24A of the 1980 Act(4));

(f) in a case of low-value shoplifting, whether the defendant chooses Crown Court trial: see section 22A of the 1980 Act(5).]
Under paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 17 to the Crime and Courts Act 2013 and section 2 of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933, the Crown Court may give permission to serve a draft indictment where it approves a deferred prosecution agreement. See Part 11 for the rules about that procedure and Part 10 for the rules about indictments.
The procedure for applying for the permission of a High Court judge to serve a draft indictment is in rule 10.9 (Application to a High Court judge for permission to serve a draft indictment).
The Court of Appeal may order a retrial under section 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968(1) (on a defendant’s appeal against conviction) or under section 77 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003(2) (on a prosecutor’s application for the retrial of a serious offence after acquittal). Section 8 of the 1968 Act, section 84 of the 2003 Act and rules 27.6 and 39.14 require the arraignment of a defendant within 2 months.]

must order such a hearing, under section 29 of the 1996 Act, where section 29(1B) or (1C) applies (cases in which a terrorism offence is charged, or other serious cases with a terrorist connection).
(2) The court may decide whether to order a preparatory hearing—
(a)
on an application or on its own initiative;
(b)
at a hearing (in public or in private), or without a hearing; and
(c)
in a party’s absence, if that party—
(i)
applied for the order, or

has had at least 10 business days in which to make representations.
[Note. See also section 45(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and section 18(1) of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004.
At a preparatory hearing, the court may—
(a)
require the prosecution to set out its case in a written statement, to arrange its evidence in a form that will be easiest for the jury (if there is one) to understand, to prepare a list of agreed facts, and to amend the case statement following representations from the defence (section 9(4) of the 1987 Act, section 31(4) of the 1996 Act); and
(b)
require the defence to give notice of any objection to the prosecution case statement, and to give notice stating the extent of agreement with the prosecution as to documents and other matters and the reason for any disagreement (section 9(5) of the 1987 Act, section 31(6), (7), (9) of the 1996 Act).
Under section 10 of the 1987 Act(5), and under section 34 of the 1996 Act(6), if either party later departs from the case or objections disclosed by that party, then the court, or another party, may comment on that, and the court may draw such inferences as appear proper.]

(i)
that each indictment (or draft indictment, as the case may be) that the prosecutor wants to be read to or placed before the defendant sets out a statement of each offence that the prosecutor wants the court to try and such particulars of the conduct constituting the commission of each such offence as the prosecutor relies upon to make clear what is alleged, and

(a)
at a hearing, in public or in private, or without a hearing; and
(b)
on an application under rule 3.36 (Content of application for a live link direction) or on its own initiative.
(2) Whether it acts on an application or on its own initiative, the court must not give, vary or rescind a live link direction unless—
(a)
the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so; and
(b)
each party and (if applicable) any representative of the youth offending team whose functions are exercisable in relation to a defendant—
(i)
is present, or
(ii)
has had an opportunity to make representations.
(3) In deciding whether to give a live link direction the court must consider—
(a)
any guidance given by the Lord Chief Justice under section 51(5)(a) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003; and
(b)
all the circumstances of the case.
(4) Those circumstances include in particular—
(a)
the availability of the proposed participant by live link;
(b)
any potential need for that person to attend in person instead of by live link;
(c)
any views which that person may have expressed;
(d)
the suitability of the facilities at the place where that person would take part by live link if the direction were given;
(e)
that person’s ability to take part effectively if the direction were given (and see paragraph (5));
(f)
if the proposed direction is for a person to give evidence by live link—
(i)
the importance of that person’s evidence to the case, and
(ii)
any potential for the proposed direction to inhibit a party from effectively testing that evidence; F3...
[F4(g)
if the proposed direction is for a person to take part by live link from a place outside the United Kingdom, any permission needed from a court or other authority in that place; and]
[F5(h)]
arrangements for members of the public to see and hear proceedings at which a person takes part by live link (and see paragraph (6)).
(5) In assessing a person’s ability to take part effectively by live link, where that person is a defendant the court must have regard to, among other things―
(a)
whether that defendant will be represented at the hearing for which the live link is proposed; and
(b)
what other assistance will be available to that defendant at that hearing (for example, an intermediary).
(6) In assessing arrangements for members of the public to see and hear proceedings the court must have regard to, among other things, the terms of any direction under section 85A of the Courts Act 2003 (Remote observation and recording of proceedings by direction of the court).
[F6(7) Where the proposed live link direction is for a person to take part by live link from a place outside the United Kingdom, the party in respect of whose case it is sought must assist the court by―
(a)
finding out whether permission is needed from a court or other authority in that place;
(b)
preparing any formal request needed to obtain that permission; and
(c)
obtaining any such permission required.]
[F7(8)] Where the court refuses an application to give, vary or rescind a live link direction the court must announce in public its reasons for doing so.

Under section 36 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933(22), no-one under 14 may be present in court when someone else is on trial, or during proceedings preliminary to a trial, unless that person is required as a witness, or for the purposes of justice, or the court permits.

(b)
to restrict public access to what otherwise would be a public hearing, for example to control disorder;

(f)
the prosecutor’s dominant motive would render the prosecution an abuse of the process of the court.]
[Note. In some legislation, including the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, an application for the issue of a summons or warrant is described as an ‘information’ and serving an application on the court officer or presenting it to the court is described as ‘laying’ that information.
[F3Where an offence can be tried only in a magistrates’ court the general time limit for serving or presenting an application for a summons or warrant, and for issuing a written charge, is prescribed by section 127 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980and section 30(5) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. However, the legislation that creates the offence may prescribe a different time limit, which may be calculated by reference to the date of the offence or by reference to another event specified by that legislation. If the application contains insufficient information to show that it is in time the court may refuse to issue a summons or warrant.]
In section 17 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 ‘public authority’ means (a) a police force as defined by that Act, (b) the Crown Prosecution Service or any other government department, (c) a local authority or other authority or body constituted for purposes of the public service or of local government, or carrying on under national ownership any industry or undertaking or part of an industry or undertaking, or (d) any other authority or body whose members are appointed by Her Majesty or by any Minister of the Crown or government department or whose revenues consist wholly or mainly of money provided by Parliament.
Part 46 (Representatives) contains rules allowing a member, officer or employee of a prosecutor, on the prosecutor’s behalf, to—
(a)
serve on the court officer or present to the court an application for the issue of a summons or warrant; or
(b)
issue a written charge and requisition.
See Part 3 for the court’s general powers of case management, including power to consider applications and give directions for (among other things) the amendment of an allegation or charge and for separate trials.
See also Part 32 (Breach, revocation and amendment of community and other orders). Rule 32.2(2) (Application by responsible officer) applies rules 7.2 to 7.4 to the procedure with which that rule deals.

(i)
sections 17A to 26 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, and
(ii)
sections 50A to 52 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998; and
(b)
the sending back or referring of cases to a magistrates’ court for trial under—
(i)
section 46ZA of the Senior Courts Act 1981, and
(ii)
paragraph 6 of Schedule 3 to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.]
(2) Rules 9.6 and 9.7 apply in a magistrates’ court where the court must, or can, send a defendant to the Crown Court for trial, without allocating the case for trial there.
(3) Rules 9.8 to 9.14 apply in a magistrates’ court where the court must allocate the case to a magistrates’ court or to the Crown Court for trial.
[F2(4) Rule 9.15 applies in a magistrates’ court where, after applying other rules in this Part, the court can commit for sentence to the Crown Court a defendant who pleads guilty to an offence related to one sent for trial there.]
[F3(5) Rule 9.16 applies in the Crown Court where the court can send back or refer a defendant to a magistrates’ court for trial.]
[F4[Note. At the first hearing in a magistrates’ court the court may (and in some cases must) order trial in that court, or may (and in some cases must) send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial under section 51 or 51A of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
The decision depends upon—
(a)
the classification of the offence (and the general rule, subject to exceptions, is that an offence classified as triable only on indictment must be sent to the Crown Court for trial; an offence classified as triable only summarily must be tried in a magistrates’ court; and an offence classified as triable either way, on indictment or summarily, must be allocated to one or the other court for trial, subject to the defendant’s right to choose Crown Court trial: see in particular sections 50A, 51 and 51A of the 1998 Act and section 19 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980);
(b)
the defendant’s age (and the general rule, subject to exceptions, is that an offence alleged against a defendant under 18 must be tried in a magistrates’ court sitting as a youth court: see in particular sections 24 and 24A of the 1980 Act);
(c)
whether the defendant is awaiting Crown Court trial for another offence;
(d)
whether another defendant, charged with the same offence, is awaiting Crown Court trial for that offence;
(e)
in some cases (destroying or damaging property; aggravated vehicle taking), whether the value involved is more or less than £5,000; and
(f)
in a case of low-value shoplifting, whether the defendant chooses Crown Court trial: see section 22A of the 1980 Act.]
[F5A magistrates’ court’s powers] of sending and allocation, including its powers (i) to receive a defendant’s indication of an intention to plead guilty (see rules 9.7, 9.8 and 9.13) and (ii) to give an indication of likely sentence (see rule 9.11), may be exercised by a single justice: see sections 51 and 51A(11) of the 1998 Act, and sections 17E, 18(5) and 24D of the 1980 Act(1).]

9.2.—[F1(1) This rule applies to the exercise of a magistrates’ court’s powers to which this Part applies.]
(2) The general rule is that the court must exercise its powers at a hearing in public, but it may exercise any power it has to—
(a)
withhold information from the public; or
(b)
order a hearing in private.
(3) The general rule is that the court must exercise its powers in the defendant’s presence, but it may exercise the powers to which the following rules apply in the defendant’s absence on the conditions specified—
[F2(a)
where rule 9.7 (Sending for Crown Court trial) applies, if the defendant is represented;]
[F3(b)]
where rule 9.8 (Adult defendant: request for plea), rule 9.9 (Adult defendant: guilty plea) or rule 9.13 (Young defendant) applies, if—
(i)
the defendant is represented, and
(ii)
the defendant’s disorderly conduct makes his or her presence in the courtroom impracticable; F4...
[F3(c)]
where rule 9.10 (Adult defendant: not guilty plea) or rule 9.11 (Adult defendant: allocation for magistrates’ court trial) applies, if—
(i)
the defendant is represented and waives the right to be present, or
(ii)
the defendant’s disorderly conduct makes his or her presence in the courtroom impracticable [F5and]
[F6(d)
where rule 9.15 (Committal for sentence for offence related to an offence sent for trial) applies, unless—
(i)
it appears to the court to be contrary to the interests of justice to do so, and
(ii)
the court considers that there is an acceptable reason for the defendant’s absence.]
[F7(4) The court may exercise its power to adjourn—
(a)
if either party asks; or
(b)
on its own initiative.]
(5) Where the court on the same occasion deals with two or more offences alleged against the same defendant, the court must deal with those offences in the following sequence—
(a)
any to which rule 9.6 applies (Prosecutor’s notice requiring Crown Court trial);
(b)
any to which rule 9.7 applies (sending for Crown Court trial, without allocation there), in this sequence—
(i)
any the court must send for trial, then
(ii)
any the court can send for trial; and
(c)
any to which rule 9.14 applies (Allocation and sending for Crown Court trial).
(6) Where the court on the same occasion deals with two or more defendants charged jointly with an offence that can be tried in the Crown Court then in the following sequence—
(a)
the court must explain, in terms each defendant can understand (with help, if necessary), that if the court sends one of them to the Crown Court for trial then the court must send for trial in the Crown Court, too, any other of them—
(i)
who is charged with the same offence as the defendant sent for trial, or with an offence which the court decides is related to that offence,
(ii)
who does not wish to plead guilty to each offence with which he or she is charged, and
(iii)
(if that other defendant is under 18, and the court would not otherwise have sent him or her for Crown Court trial) where the court decides that sending is necessary in the interests of justice
even if the court by then has decided to allocate that other defendant for magistrates’ court trial; and
(b)
the court may ask the defendants questions to help it decide in what order to deal with them.
(7) After following paragraph (5), if it applies, where the court on the same occasion—
(a)
deals with two or more defendants charged jointly with an offence that can be tried in the Crown Court;
(b)
allocates any of them to a magistrates’ court for trial; and
(c)
then sends another one of them to the Crown Court for trial,
the court must deal again with each one whom, on that occasion, it has allocated for magistrates’ court trial.

(a)
the allegation, unless it is self-explanatory;

(d)
decide whether or not to send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial.
(5) If the court sends the defendant to the Crown Court for trial, it must—
(a)
ask whether the defendant intends to plead guilty in the Crown Court and—

(b)
give any other ancillary directions.

Rule 9.9 in force at 5.10.2020, see PreambleAdult defendant: not guilty plea
9.10.—(1) This rule applies where—
(a)
rule 9.8 applies; and
(b)
the defendant—
(i)
indicates an intention to plead not guilty, or
(ii)
gives no indication of intended plea.
(2) In the following sequence, the court must then—
(a)
where the offence is one to which section 22 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 applies, explain in terms the defendant can understand (with help, if necessary) that—
(i)
if the court decides that the value involved clearly is less than £5,000, the court must order trial in a magistrates’ court,
(ii)
if the court decides that it is not clear whether that value is more or less than £5,000, then the court will ask whether the defendant agrees to be tried in a magistrates’ court, and
(iii)
if the answer to that question is ‘yes’, then the court must order such a trial and if the defendant is convicted then the maximum sentence is limited;
(b)
invite the prosecutor to—
(i)
identify any previous convictions of which it can take account, and
(ii)
make representations about how the court should allocate the case for trial, including representations about the value involved, if relevant;
(c)
invite the defendant to make such representations;
(d)
where the offence is one to which section 22 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 applies—
(i)
if it is not clear whether the value involved is more or less than £5,000, ask whether the defendant agrees to be tried in a magistrates’ court,
(ii)
if the defendant’s answer to that question is ‘yes’, or if that value clearly is less than £5,000, order a trial in a magistrates’ court,
(iii)
if the defendant does not answer that question, or the answer is ‘no’, or if that value clearly is more than £5,000, apply paragraph (2)(e); and
(e)
exercise its power to allocate the case for trial, taking into account—
(i)
the adequacy of a magistrates’ court’s sentencing powers,
(ii)
any representations by the parties, and
(iii)
any allocation guidelines issued by the Sentencing Council.
[Note. See sections 17A, 18, 19, 22 and 24A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(1).
Under section 22 of the 1980 Act, some offences, which otherwise could be tried in a magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court, must be tried in a magistrates’ court in the circumstances described in this rule.
The convictions of which the court may take account are those specified by section 19 of the 1980 Act.
The Sentencing Council may issue allocation guidelines under section 122 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009(2). The definitive allocation guideline which took effect on 1st March, 2016 provides:
(1) In general, either way offences should be tried summarily unless—
(a)
the outcome would clearly be a sentence in excess of the court’s powers for the offence(s) concerned after taking into account personal mitigation and any potential reduction for a guilty plea; or
(b)
for reasons of unusual legal, procedural or factual complexity, the case should be tried in the Crown Court. This exception may apply in cases where a very substantial fine is the likely sentence. Other circumstances where this exception will apply are likely to be rare and case specific; the court will rely on the submissions of the parties to identify relevant cases.
(2) In cases with no factual or legal complications the court should bear in mind its power to commit for sentence after a trial and may retain jurisdiction notwithstanding that the likely sentence might exceed its powers.
(3) Cases may be tried summarily even where the defendant is subject to a Crown Court Suspended Sentence Order or Community Order.
(4) All parties should be asked by the court to make representations as to whether the case is suitable for summary trial. The court should refer to definitive guidelines (if any) to assess the likely sentence for the offence in the light of the facts alleged by the prosecution case, taking into account all aspects of the case including those advanced by the defence, including any personal mitigation to which the defence wish to refer.
Where the court decides that the case is suitable to be dealt with in the magistrates’ court, it must warn the defendant that all sentencing options remain open and, if the defendant consents to summary trial and is convicted by the court or pleads guilty, the defendant may be committed to the Crown Court for sentence.]

(iii)
if the defendant does not answer that question, or the answer is ‘no’, apply rule 9.14.

(a)
ask whether the defendant agrees to trial in a magistrates’ court;

an offence classified as triable only summarily is related to an offence for which a defendant has been sent for trial in the Crown Court if both offences arise out of the same or connected circumstances.
Under section 51 of the 1998 Act—
(a)
if a magistrates’ court sends a defendant to the Crown Court for trial for an offence and on the same occasion deals with a related offence then the general rule is that the court must send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial for the related offence, too; but
(b)
if the court sends a defendant to the Crown Court for trial for an offence on one occasion and on a later occasion deals with a related offence then it may send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial for the related offence, too, or it may finish dealing with that offence itself and, if it convicts the defendant, may commit the defendant for sentence to the Crown Court instead.
For the circumstances in which a magistrates’ court may (and, in some cases, must) commit a defendant to the Crown Court for sentenceor for the making of other orders beyond a magistrates’ court’s powers, see sections 14, 15, 16, 16A, 17, 18, 19, 20 and 24 of the Sentencing Act 2020 and paragraph 11 of Schedule 16 to that Act.

(i)
at a hearing, in public or in private, or without a hearing,

(a)
the Crown Court must exercise its power at a hearing; and
(b)
unless the defendant pleads guilty to the summary offence, the Crown Court officer must notify the magistrates’ court officer of the outcome of the proceedings.
[Note. An offence may be classified as triable only on indictment; triable only summarily (a summary offence); or triable either way (on indictment or summarily). Offences classified either as triable only on indictment or as triable either way collectively are described as indictable offences.
Under section 46ZA(2) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 the Crown Court cannot send the defendant back to a magistrates’ court for trial—
(a)
where the defendant is 18 or over, or is a corporation, and the offence is triable only on indictment; or

Under section 46ZA(3) of the 1981 Act the Crown Court cannot send an adult or corporate defendant back to a magistrates’ court for trial for an offence triable either way unless the defendant consents.
Under section 46ZA(5) of the 1981 Act, in deciding whether to send a defendant back the Crown Court must take into account (a) any other related offence before the Crown Court (whether the same, or a different, person is accused or has been convicted of the other offence), and (b) any allocation guideline.
Under section 46ZA(6) of the 1981 Act, on sending a defendant back the Crown Court may give such directions as appear to be necessary with respect to the custody of the defendant or for the defendant’s release on bail until the defendant can appear or be brought before the magistrates’ court.
Under paragraph 6(7) of Schedule 3 to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the Crown Court must inform the magistrates’ court of the outcome of the proceedings in the Crown Court where—
(a)
the offences for which the defendant was sent for trial include a summary offence;
(b)
that summary offence is not tried in the Crown Court under a power to do so;
(c)
in the Crown Court the defendant is convicted of an indictable offence;
(d)
the Crown Court considers that the summary offence is related to any indictable offence for which the defendant was sent for trial;
(e)
under paragraph 6(4), the defendant does not plead guilty in the Crown Court to the summary offence; and
(f)
under paragraph 6(6), the prosecutor does not wish to withdraw the prosecution for that offence.
Under paragraph 6(5) of Schedule 3 to the 1998 Act, the Crown Court then has no other powers, for example to send the defendant back to the magistrates’ court on bail or in custody.
See also rule 28.10 (Committal or remission, etc. for sentence), which applies to the exercise of the Crown Court’s powers under sections 25, 25A and 26 of the Sentencing Act 2020 to remit a convicted defendant to a magistrates’ court for sentence.]]

Part 3 contains rules about the court’s general powers of case management, including power to consider applications and give directions for (among other things) the amendment of an indictment and for separate trials under section 5 of the Indictments Act 1915. See in particular rule 3.29 (Application for joint or separate trials, etc.).
Under section 51D of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998(8), the magistrates’ court must notify the Crown Court of the offence or offences for which the defendant is sent for trial. Part 9 (Allocation and sending for trial) contains relevant rules.
A Crown Court judge may approve a proposed indictment on approving a deferred prosecution agreement. Part 11 (Deferred prosecution agreements) contains relevant rules.
A prosecutor may apply to a High Court judge for permission to serve a draft indictment under rule 10.9.
Under section 22B of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, one of the prosecutors listed in that section may re-institute proceedings that have been stayed under section 22(4) of that Act(9) on the expiry of an overall time limit (where such a time limit has been prescribed). Section 22B(2) requires the service of a draft indictment within 3 months of the date on which the Crown Court ordered the stay, or within such longer period as the court allows.
The Court of Appeal may order a retrial under section 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (on a defendant’s appeal against conviction) or under section 77 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (on a prosecutor’s application for the retrial of a serious offence after acquittal). Section 8 of the 1968 Act and section 84 of the 2003 Act require the arraignment of a defendant within 2 months. See also rules 27.7 and 39.14.
Where a magistrates’ court sends a defendant to the Crown Court for trial under section 51 or 51A of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, in some circumstances the Crown Court may try the defendant for other offences: see section 2(2) of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 (indictable offences founded on the prosecution evidence), section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988(10) (specified summary offences founded on that evidence) and paragraph 6 of Schedule 3 to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (power of Crown Court to deal with related summary offence sent to that court). An offence of theft under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 which is low-value shoplifting under section 22A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(11) is a summary offence unless the defendant chooses to be tried in the Crown Court.]

if the arrest was under a Crown Court warrant, to be brought at once before—
(i)

if the arrest was within 24 hours of the time at which that defendant was due to surrender into the custody of a court then the court officer must arrange for the defendant to be brought before that court; and

[F114.18.]—(1) The court must determine an application to which rule [F214.19] (Application to authorise extension of pre-charge bail) applies—
(a)
without a hearing, subject to paragraph (2); and
(b)
as soon as practicable, but as a general rule no sooner than the fifth business day after the application was served.
(2) The court must determine an application at a hearing where—
(a)
if the application succeeds, its effect will be to extend the period for which the defendant is on bail to F3... [F424 months] [F5or less] from the day after the defendant’s arrest for the offence and the court considers that the interests of justice require a hearing;
(b)

(c)

(3) Any hearing must be in private.
(4) Subject to rule [F614.20] (Application to withhold information from the defendant), at a hearing the court may determine an application in the absence of—
(a)
the applicant; and
(b)
the defendant, if the defendant has had at least 5 business days in which to make representations.
(5) If the court so directs, a party to an application may attend a hearing by live link F7....
(6) The court must not authorise an extension of the period for which a defendant is on bail before being charged unless—
(a)
the applicant states, in writing or orally, that to the best of the applicant’s knowledge and belief—
(i)
the application discloses all the information that is material to what the court must decide, and
(ii)
the content of the application is true; or
(b)
the application includes a statement by an investigator of the suspected offence that to the best of that investigator’s knowledge and belief those requirements are met.
(7) Where the statement required by paragraph (6) is made orally—
(a)
the statement must be on oath or affirmation, unless the court otherwise directs; and
(b)
the court must arrange for a record of the making of the statement.
(8) The court may shorten or extend (even after it has expired) a time limit imposed by this rule or by rule [F814.19] (Application to authorise extension of pre-charge bail).
[Note. For the definition of ‘defendant’ for the purposes of this rule and [F9rules 14.19 and 14.20], see rule 14.1(3).
[F10Sections 47ZA and 47ZB of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 limit the period during which a defendant who has been arrested for an offence may be on bail after being released without being charged. That period (‘the applicable bail period’) is—
(a)
6 months from the day after the day on which the defendant was arrested (the defendant’s ‘bail start date’) in an ‘FCA’, ‘HMRC’, ‘NCA’ or ‘SFO’ case (that is, a case, as defined by section 47ZB, being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority, an officer of Revenue and Customs, the National Crime Agency or the Serious Fraud Office, as applicable); and
(b)
3 months from the defendant’s bail start date in any other case (‘a standard case’).
Under section 47ZDB of the 1984 Act, in an FCA, HMRC, NCA or SFO case the applicable bail period may be extended on the authority of the appropriate decision maker until the end of 12 months from the bail start date. ‘Appropriate decision maker’ is defined as, in summary, a senior officer of the relevant authority.
Under sections 47ZC and 47ZD of the 1984 Act, in a standard case the applicable bail period may be extended on the authority of a police officer of the rank of inspector or above until the end of 6 months from the bail start date. Under section 47ZDA the applicable bail period may be further extended on the authority of a police officer of the rank of superintendent or above until the end of 9 months from the bail start date.
Under sections 47ZC and 47ZE of the 1984 Act, if the case is designated by the Director of Public Prosecutions as exceptionally complex (a ‘designated case’) the applicable bail period may be further extended on the authority of one of the senior officers listed in section 47ZE until the end of 12 months from the bail start date.
Under section 47ZF of the 1984 Act, on an application made before the date on which the applicable bail period ends by a constable, a member of staff of the Financial Conduct Authority of the description designated by its Chief Executive, an officer of Revenue and Customs, a National Crime Agency officer, a member of the Serious Fraud Office or a Crown Prosecutor, a magistrates’ court may authorise an extension of that period—
(a)
from a previous total of 9 months to a new total of 12 months or, if the investigation is unlikely to be completed or a police charging decision made within a lesser period, a new total of 18 months (following extension under section 47ZDA of the Act);
(b)
from a previous total of 12 months to a new total of 18 months or, if the investigation is unlikely to be completed or a police charging decision made within a lesser period, a new total of 24 months (following extension under section 47ZDB or 47ZE of the Act),
where the conditions listed in that section are met.]
Under section 47ZG of the Act, on a further such application (of which there may be more than one) a magistrates’ court may authorise a further extension of the applicable bail period, on each occasion by a further 3 months or, if the investigation is unlikely to be completed or a police charging decision made within a lesser period, a further 6 months, where the conditions listed in that section are met.
Under section 47ZL of the Act(1), the running of the applicable bail period does not begin (in the case of a first release on bail) or is suspended (in any other case) where—
(a)
the defendant is released on bail to await a charging decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions under section 37B of the Act; or
(b)
following arrest for breach of such bail the defendant is again released on bail.
The court’s authority therefore is not required for an extension of an applicable bail period the running of which is postponed or suspended pending a Director’s charging decision. However—
(a)
time runs in any period during which information requested by the Director is being obtained; and
(b)
if the Director requests information less than 7 days before the applicable bail period otherwise would end then the running of that period is further suspended until the end of 7 days beginning with the day on which the Director’s request is made.
See also section 47ZI of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984(2) (Sections 47ZF to 47ZH: proceedings in magistrates’ courts). The requirement for the court except in specified circumstances to determine an application without a hearing is prescribed by that section. Under that section the court must comprise a single justice of the peace unless a hearing is convened, when it must comprise two or more justices.]

apply in writing before the date on which the defendant’s pre-charge bail is due to end;
(b)

the defendant; and
(d)
serve on the defendant, with the application, a form of response notice for the defendant’s use.
(3) The application must specify—
(a)
the offence or offences for which the defendant was arrested;
(b)
the date on which the defendant’s pre-charge bail began;
(c)
the date and period of any previous extension of that bail;
(d)
the date on which that bail is due to end;
(e)
the conditions of that bail; and
(f)
if different, the bail conditions which are to be imposed if the court authorises an extension, or further extension, of the period for which the defendant is released on pre-charge bail.
(4) The application must explain—
(a)
the grounds for believing that, as applicable—
(i)
further investigation is needed of any matter in connection with the offence or offences for which the defendant was released on bail, or
(ii)
further time is needed for making a decision as to whether to charge the defendant with that offence or those offences;
(b)
the grounds for believing that, as applicable—
(i)
the investigation into the offence or offences for which the defendant was released on bail is being conducted diligently and expeditiously, or
(ii)
the decision as to whether to charge the defendant with that offence or those offences is being made diligently and expeditiously; and
(c)
the grounds for believing that the defendant’s further release on bail is necessary and proportionate in all the circumstances having regard, in particular, to any conditions of bail imposed.
(5) The application must—
(a)
indicate whether the applicant wants the court to authorise an extension of the defendant’s bail for 3 months or for 6 months; and

the application is made before the date on which the defendant’s bail is due to end; but
(b)
it is not likely to be practicable for the court to determine the application before that date.
(7) A defendant who objects to the application must—

serve notice on—
(i)
the court officer, and
(ii)
the applicant
not more than 5 business days after service of the application; and

1984 c. 60; section 47ZJ was inserted by section 63 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 (c. 3).Application to withhold information from the defendant
[F114.20.]—(1) This rule applies where an application to authorise an extension of pre-charge bail includes an application to withhold information from the defendant.
(2) The applicant must—
(a)
omit that information from the part of the application that is served on the defendant;
(b)
mark the other part to show that, unless the court otherwise directs, it is only for the court; and
(c)
in that other part, explain the grounds for believing that the disclosure of that information would have one or more of the following results—
(i)
evidence connected with an indictable offence would be interfered with or harmed,
(ii)
a person would be interfered with or physically injured,
(iii)
a person suspected of having committed an indictable offence but not yet arrested for the offence would be alerted, or
(iv)
the recovery of property obtained as a result of an indictable offence would be hindered.
(3) At any hearing of an application to which this rule applies—
(a)
the court must first determine the application to withhold information, in the defendant’s absence and that of any legal representative of the defendant; and
(b)
if the court allows the application to withhold information, then in the following sequence—
(i)
the court must consider representations first by the applicant and then by the defendant, in the presence of both, and
(ii)
the court may consider further representations by the applicant in the defendant’s absence and that of any legal representative of the defendant, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that information withheld from the defendant would be disclosed during those further representations.
(4) If the court refuses an application to withhold information from the defendant, the applicant may withdraw the application to authorise an extension of pre-charge bail.
[Note. See sections 47ZH and 47ZI(5), (6), (8) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984(1) (withholding sensitive information; proceedings in magistrates’ courts: determination of applications to withhold sensitive information).]
Summary of the general entitlement to bail and of the exceptions
The court must consider bail whenever it can order the defendant’s detention pending trial or sentencing, or in an extradition case, and whether an application is made or not. Under section 4 of the Bail Act 1976(2), the general rule, subject to exceptions, is that a defendant must be granted bail. Under Part IIA of Schedule 1 to the Act(3), if the court decides not to grant the defendant bail then at each subsequent hearing the court must consider whether to grant bail.
Section 3 of the Bail Act 1976(4) allows the court, before granting bail, to require a surety or security to secure the defendant’s surrender to custody; and allows the court, on granting bail, to impose such requirements as appear to the court to be necessary—
(a)
to secure that the defendant surrenders to custody;
(b)
to secure that the defendant does not commit an offence while on bail;
(c)
to secure that the defendant does not interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice whether in relation to the defendant or any other person;
(d)
for the defendant’s own protection or, if a child or young person, for the defendant’s welfare or in the defendant’s own interests;
(e)
to secure the defendant’s availability for the purpose of enabling enquiries or a report to be made to assist the court in dealing with the defendant for the offence;
(f)
to secure that before the time appointed for surrender to custody the defendant attends an interview with a legal representative.
Under section 3 of the Bail Act 1976, a person granted bail in criminal proceedings is under a duty to surrender to custody as required by that bail. Under section 6 of the Act, such a person who fails without reasonable cause so to surrender commits an offence and, under section 7, may be arrested.
Exceptions to the general right to bail are listed in Schedule 1 to the Bail Act 1976(5). They differ according to the category of offence concerned. Under section 4(2B) of the 1976 Act(6), in an extradition case there is no general right to bail where the defendant is alleged to have been convicted in the territory requesting extradition.
Under Part I of Schedule 1 to the 1976 Act, where the offence is punishable with imprisonment, and is not one that can be tried only in a magistrates’ court, or in an extradition case—
(a)
the defendant need not be granted bail if the court is satisfied that—
(i)
there are substantial grounds for believing that, if released on bail (with or without conditions), the defendant would fail to surrender to custody, would commit an offence, or would interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice,
(ii)
there are substantial grounds for believing that, if released on bail (with or without conditions), the defendant would commit an offence by engaging in conduct that would, or would be likely to, cause physical or mental injury to an associated person (within the meaning of section 33 of the Family Law Act 1996(7)), or cause that person to fear injury,
(iii)
the defendant should be kept in custody for his or her own protection or welfare, or
(iv)
it has not been practicable, for want of time since the institution of the proceedings, to obtain sufficient information for the court to take the decisions required;
(b)
the defendant need not be granted bail if it appears to the court that the defendant was on bail at the time of the offence (this exception does not apply in an extradition case);
(c)
the defendant need not be granted bail if, having been released on bail in the case on a previous occasion, the defendant since has been arrested for breach of bail;
(d)
the defendant need not be granted bail if in custody pursuant to a sentence;
(e)
the defendant need not be granted bail if it appears to the court that it would be impracticable to complete enquiries or a report for which the case is to be adjourned without keeping the defendant in custody;
(f)
the defendant may not be granted bail if charged with murder, unless the court is of the opinion that there is no significant risk of the defendant committing an offence while on bail that would, or would be likely to, cause physical or mental injury to some other person;
(g)
the defendant in an extradition case need not be granted bail if he or she was on bail on the date of the alleged offence and that offence is not one that could be tried only in a magistrates’ court if it were committed in England or Wales.
Exceptions (a)(i), (b) and (c) do not apply where—
(a)
the defendant is 18 or over;
(b)
the defendant has not been convicted of an offence in those proceedings; and
(c)
it appears to the court that there is no real prospect that the defendant will be sentenced to a custodial sentence in those proceedings.
In deciding whether an exception to the right to bail applies the court must have regard to any relevant consideration, including—
(a)
the nature and seriousness of the offence, and the probable method of dealing with the defendant for it;
(b)
the character, antecedents, associations and community ties of the defendant;
(c)
the defendant’s record of fulfilling obligations imposed under previous grants of bail; and
(d)
except where the case is adjourned for enquires or a report, the strength of the evidence of the defendant having committed the offence.
Under Part IA of Schedule 1 to the 1976 Act, where the offence is punishable with imprisonment, and is one that can be tried only in a magistrates’ court—
(a)
the defendant need not be granted bail if it appears to the court that—
(i)
having previously been granted bail in criminal proceedings, the defendant has failed to surrender as required and, in view of that failure, the court believes that, if released on bail (with or without conditions), the defendant would fail to surrender to custody, or
(ii)
the defendant was on bail on the date of the offence and the court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if released on bail (with or without conditions), the defendant would commit an offence while on bail;
(b)
the defendant need not be granted bail if the court is satisfied that—
(i)
there are substantial grounds for believing that, if released on bail (with or without conditions), the defendant would commit an offence while on bail by engaging in conduct that would, or would be likely to, cause physical or mental injury to some other person, or cause some other person to fear such injury,
(ii)
the defendant should be kept in custody for his or her own protection or welfare, or
(iii)
it has not been practicable, for want of time since the institution of the proceedings, to obtain sufficient information for the court to take the decisions required;
(c)
the defendant need not be granted bail if in custody pursuant to a sentence;
(d)
the defendant need not be granted bail if, having been released on bail in the case on a previous occasion, the defendant since has been arrested for breach of bail, and the court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if released on bail (with or without conditions), the defendant would fail to surrender to custody, would commit an offence, or would interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice.
Exceptions (a) and (d) do not apply where—
(a)
the defendant is 18 or over;
(b)
the defendant has not been convicted of an offence in those proceedings; and
(c)
it appears to the court that there is no real prospect that the defendant will be sentenced to a custodial sentence in those proceedings.
Under Part II of Schedule 1 to the 1976 Act, where the offence is not punishable with imprisonment—
(a)
the defendant need not be granted bail if it appears to the court that having previously been granted bail in criminal proceedings, the defendant has failed to surrender as required and, in view of that failure, the court believes that, if released on bail (with or without conditions), the defendant would fail to surrender to custody;
(b)
the defendant need not be granted bail if the court is satisfied that the defendant should be kept in custody for his or her own protection or welfare;
(c)
the defendant need not be granted bail if in custody pursuant to a sentence;
(d)
the defendant need not be granted bail if, having been released on bail in the case on a previous occasion, the defendant since has been arrested for breach of bail, and the court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if released on bail (with or without conditions), the defendant would fail to surrender to custody, would commit an offence, or would interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice;
(e)
the defendant need not be granted bail if, having been released on bail in the case on a previous occasion, the defendant since has been arrested for breach of bail, and the court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if released on bail (with or without conditions), the defendant would commit an offence while on bail by engaging in conduct that would, or would be likely to, cause physical or mental injury to an associated person (within the meaning of section 33 of the Family Law Act 1996), or to cause that person to fear such injury.
Exceptions (a) and (d) apply only where—
(a)
the defendant is under 18; and
(b)
the defendant has been convicted in those proceedings.
Further exceptions to the general right to bail are set out in section 25 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994(8), under which a defendant charged with murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, rape or another sexual offence specified in that section, and who has been previously convicted of such an offence, may be granted bail only if there are exceptional circumstances which justify it.

(a)
where Parts I and II of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 apply; and
(b)
where any comparable disclosure obligation applies otherwise than under the 1996 Act.
[Note. The Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 came into force on 1st April, 1997. It does not apply where the investigation began before that date. With effect from 4th April, 2005, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 made changes to the 1996 Act that do not apply to investigations begun earlier. In some circumstances, the prosecutor may be required to disclose material to which the 1996 Act does not apply: see sections 1 and 21.
Part I of the 1996 Act contains sections 1 to 21A. Part II, which contains sections 22 to 27, requires an investigator to record information relevant to an investigation that is obtained during its course.

15.2.—(1) This rule applies where any of the following occurs—
(a)
under section 3 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (Initial duty of prosecutor to disclose), or under any comparable obligation that applies where that section does not, the prosecutor—
(i)
discloses to the defendant any prosecution material that might reasonably be considered capable of undermining the case for the prosecution against the defendant or of assisting the case for the defendant (in this rule, “gives initial disclosure”), or
(ii)
gives the defendant a statement that there is no such material;
(b)
under section 7A of the 1996 Act (Continuing duty of prosecutor to disclose), or under any comparable obligation that applies where that section does not, the prosecutor discloses any further such material; or
(c)
the prosecutor serves a document (in this rule, a “disclosure management document”) prepared by the prosecutor that—
(i)
describes the prosecutor’s approach to discharging the prosecution obligations to which this Part applies; and
(ii)
gives the reasons for that approach.
(2) The prosecutor must discharge the prosecution obligations to which this Part applies as soon as is reasonably practicable.
(3) At the same time as the prosecutor discloses material to which this rule refers, or gives the defendant a statement that there is no, or no further, such material, the prosecutor must serve on the court officer notice to that effect.
(4) At the same time as the prosecutor serves on the defendant a disclosure management document, or revised such document, the prosecutor must serve that document on the court officer.
(5) As soon as is reasonably practicable after the prosecutor serves a disclosure management document, or revised such document, the defendant must—
(a)
make such observations on the content of that document as the defendant wants the court to take into account when giving directions for the preparation of the case for trial; and
(b)
serve any such observations on—
(i)
the prosecutor, and
(ii)
the court officer.

(a)
apply in writing for such a decision; and
(b)
serve the application on—
(i)
the court officer,

the defendant, but only to the extent that serving it on the defendant would not disclose what the prosecutor thinks ought not be disclosed.

(a)
describe the material, and explain why the prosecutor thinks that—
(i)
it is material that the prosecutor would have to disclose,
(ii)
it would not be in the public interest to disclose that material, and

representations first by the prosecutor and any other person served with the application, and then by the defendant, in the presence of them all, and then
(ii)
further representations by the prosecutor and any such other person in the defendant’s absence; but
(b)
the court may direct other arrangements for the hearing.

such rights of confidentiality as apply to the material; and

the defendant’s right to a fair trial.
(9) Unless the court otherwise directs, the court officer—
(a)
must not give notice to anyone other than the prosecutor—
(i)
of the hearing of an application under this rule, unless the prosecutor served the application on that person, or
(ii)
of the court’s decision on the application; and

may—
(i)
keep a written application or representations, or
(ii)
arrange for the whole or any part to be kept by some other appropriate person, subject to any conditions that the court may impose.

15.4.—(1) This rule applies where the defendant pleads not guilty and—
(a)
may give a defence statement in a magistrates’ court under section 6 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996; or
(b)
must give—
(i)
a defence statement in the Crown Court under section 5 of the 1996 Act; or
(ii)
a defence witness notice in either court under section 6C of the 1996 Act.
(2) In a magistrates’ court a defendant who wants to give a defence statement must do so not more than 14 days after the prosecutor gives initial disclosure under rule 15.2 (Prosecution disclosure and disclosure management) or gives the defendant a statement that there is no such material.
(3) In the Crown Court the defendant must give a defence statement—
(a)
if the prosecutor has served on the defendant under rule 3.19 (Service of prosecution evidence) copies of the documents containing the evidence on which the prosecution case relies; and
(b)
not more than 28 days after the prosecutor gives initial disclosure under rule 15.2 or gives the defendant a statement that there is no such material.
(4) In either court the defendant must give a defence witness notice—
(a)
within the time for giving a defence statement in that court; and
(b)
whether the defendant gives a defence statement or not.
(5) If the time for giving a defence statement expires on a day that is not a business day then the time expires on the next business day.
(6) A defendant gives a defence statement or defence witness notice by serving it on—
(a)
the court officer; and
(b)
the prosecutor.
[Note. Under section 6A of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 a defence statement must—
(a)
set out the nature of the defence, including any particular defences on which the defendant intends to rely;
(b)
indicate the matters of fact on which the defendant takes issue with the prosecutor, and, in respect of each, explain why;
(c)
set out particulars of the matters of fact on which the defendant intends to rely for the purposes of the defence;
(d)
indicate any point of law that the defendant wants to raise, including any point about the admissibility of evidence or about abuse of process, and any authority relied on; and
(e)
if the defence statement discloses an alibi, give particulars, including—
(i)
the name, address and date of birth of any witness whom the defendant believes can give evidence in support (that is, evidence that the defendant was in a place, at a time, inconsistent with having committed the offence),
(ii)
where the defendant does not know any of those details, any information that might help identify or find that witness.
Under section 6C of the 1996 Act a defence witness notice that identifies any proposed defence witness (other than the defendant) must—
(a)
give the name, address and date of birth of each such witness, or as many of those details as are known to the defendant when the notice is given;
(b)
provide any information in the defendant’s possession which might be of material assistance in identifying or finding any such witness in whose case any of the details mentioned in paragraph (a) are not known to the defendant when the notice is given; and
(c)
amend any earlier such notice, if the defendant—
(i)
decides to call a person not included in an earlier notice as a proposed witness,
(ii)
decides not to call a person so included, or
(iii)
discovers any information which the defendant would have had to include in an earlier notice, if then aware of it.
The time for giving a defence statement and a defence witness notice to which this rule refers is prescribed by section 12 of the 1996 Act and by the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (Defence Disclosure Time Limits) Regulations 2011.
Under section 11 of the 1996 Act, if a defendant—
(a)
fails to disclose what the Act requires;
(b)
fails to do so within the time prescribed;
(c)
at trial, relies on a defence, or facts, not mentioned in the defence statement;
(d)
at trial, introduces alibi evidence without having given in the defence statement—
(i)
particulars of the alibi, or
(ii)
the details of the alibi witness, or witnesses, required by the Act; or
(e)
at trial, calls a witness not identified in a defence witness notice,
then the court or another party at trial may comment on that, and the court may draw such inferences as appear proper in deciding whether the defendant is guilty.
Under section 6E(2) of the 1996 Act, if before trial in the Crown Court it seems to the court that section 11 may apply then the court must warn the defendant.]]

Rule 18.8 in force at 5.10.2020, see PreambleSpecial measures direction without application
18.9.—(1) This rule applies where—
(a)
a party notifies the court that a witness is eligible for assistance under section 16 or section 17 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999;
(b)
the notice is given at—
(i)
a preparation for trial hearing in a magistrates’ court, or
(ii)
a plea and trial preparation hearing in the Crown Court; and
(c)
no other party opposes the giving of a special measures direction for the benefit of that witness.
(2) The court may exercise its power to give a special measures direction without requiring an application under rule 18.10.
(3) The party who gives the notice must—
(a)
provide any information that the court may need to assess—
(i)
the measure or measures likely to maximise so far as practicable the quality of the witness’ evidence, and
(ii)
the witness’ own views; and
(b)
where a direction provides for video recorded evidence to be admitted under section 27 F1... of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, as soon as reasonably practicable serve such evidence on—
(i)
the court officer, and
(ii)
each other party.
[Note. Under sections 21 and 22 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, a ‘child witness’ is one who is under 18, and a ‘qualifying witness’ is one who was a child witness when interviewed.
Under those sections, the ‘primary rule’ requires the court to give a direction—
(a)
for the evidence of a child witness or of a qualifying witness to be admitted—
(i)
by means of a video recording of an interview with the witness, in the place of examination-in-chief, and
(ii)
after that, by live link; or
(b)
if one or both of those measures is not taken, for the witness while giving evidence to be screened from seeing the defendant.
The primary rule always applies unless—
(a)
the witness does not want it to apply, and the court is satisfied that to omit a measure usually required by that rule would not diminish the quality of the witness’ evidence; or
(b)
the court is satisfied that to direct one of the measures usually required by that rule would not be likely to maximise, so far as practicable, the quality of the witness’ evidence.]

the proposed measure or measures would not be likely to maximise, so far as practicable, the quality of the witness’ evidence, or
(iii)
the proposed measure or measures might tend to inhibit the effective testing of that evidence; and

(a)
the defendant’s communication needs as reported to the court;

(b)
for the duration of any specified such hearing or hearings, or for the duration of a specified part of such a hearing; or
(c)
for a specified purpose during a hearing.

(a)
on application or on the court’s own initiative;
(b)
at a hearing, in public or in private, or without a hearing; and

Summary of eligibility for measures to which this Part applies
Special measures direction
Under section 16 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999(1), a witness is eligible for the assistance of a special measures direction given under section 19 of that Act if—
(a)
the witness is under 18; or
(b)
the witness has—
(i)
a mental disorder, or a significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning, or
(ii)
a physical disability or disorder
and the court considers that the completeness, coherence and accuracy (the ‘quality’) of evidence given by the witness is likely to be diminished by reason of those circumstances.
Under section 17 of the 1999(2) Act, a witness is eligible for such assistance if—
(a)
the court is satisfied that the quality of evidence given by the witness is likely to be diminished because of his or her fear or distress in connection with giving evidence, taking account particularly of—
(i)
the circumstances of the offence,
(ii)
the witness’ age, social and cultural background, ethnic origins, domestic and employment circumstances, religious beliefs or political opinions,
(iii)
any behaviour towards the witness on the part of the defendant, the defendant’s family or associates, or any other potential defendant or witness, and
(iv)
the witness’ own views;
(b)
the witness is the complainant in respect of a sexual offence [F9or other offence specified by the Act], and has not declined such assistance; or
(c)
the offence is one of a list of offences involving weapons, and the witness has not declined such assistance.
Section 28 of the 1999 Act (video recorded cross-examination or re-examination) is not yet [F10fully] in force. With that exception, all the special measures listed in rule 18.1 potentially are available where the witness is eligible for assistance under section 16 of the Act. Those numbered (i) to (v) are available where the witness is eligible for assistance under section 17.
As a general rule, but with exceptions, the court must give a special measures direction—
(a)
under section 21 or 22 of the 1999 Act(3), where the witness—
(i)
is under 18, or
(ii)
was under that age when interviewed
whether or not an application for a direction is made;
(b)
under section 22A of the 1999 Act(4), where an application is made in the Crown Court for the evidence of a witness who is the complainant of a sexual offence to be admitted by means of a video recording of an interview with the witness in the place of examination-in-chief.
Defendant’s evidence direction
[F11When the Coroners and Justice Act 2009(3) comes into force, under section 33BA of the 1999 Act the court can allow a defendant to give evidence through an intermediary if—
(a)
the defendant—
(i)
is under 18, and the defendant’s ability to participate effectively as a witness giving oral evidence is compromised by his or her level of intellectual ability or social functioning; or
(ii)
suffers from a mental disorder or some other significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning and cannot participate effectively as a witness giving oral evidence for that reason; and;
(b)
the examination of the defendant through an intermediary is necessary to ensure that the defendant receives a fair trial.]
Witness anonymity order
Under section 86 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009(5), a witness anonymity order is an order that specifies measures to be taken to ensure that the identity of a witness is not disclosed, such as withholding the witness’ name from materials disclosed to a party to the proceedings, the use of a pseudonym, the screening of the witness from view, the modulation of the witness’ voice, and the prohibition of questions that might reveal his or her identity. Before making such an order, the court must—
(a)
be satisfied that three conditions prescribed by the Act are met (section 88 of the 2009 Act); and
(b)
have regard to considerations specified by the Act (section 89 of the 2009 Act).

[Note. Under section 98 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, evidence of a person’s bad character means evidence of, or of a disposition towards, misconduct on that person’s part, other than evidence that—
(a)
has to do with the alleged facts of the offence; or

Under section 100(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, evidence of a non-defendant’s bad character is admissible if—
(a)
it is important explanatory evidence;
(b)
it has substantial probative value in relation to a matter which—
(i)
is a matter in issue in the proceedings, and
(ii)
is of substantial importance in the context of the case as a whole; or
(c)
all parties to the proceedings agree to the evidence being admissible.
The section explains requirements (a) and (b). Unless the parties agree to the evidence being admissible, it may not be introduced without the court’s permission.
Under section 101(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, evidence of a defendant’s bad character is admissible if—
(a)
all parties to the proceedings agree to the evidence being admissible;
(b)
the evidence is introduced by the defendant, or is given in answer to a question asked by the defendant in cross-examination which was intended to elicit that evidence;
(c)
it is important explanatory evidence;
(d)
it is relevant to an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution;
(e)
it has substantial probative value in relation to an important matter in issue between the defendant and a co-defendant;
(f)
it is evidence to correct a false impression given by the defendant; or
(g)
the defendant has made an attack on another person’s character.
Sections 102 to 106 of the Act supplement those requirements. The court must not admit evidence under (d) or (g) if, on an application by the defendant, the court concludes that to do so would be unfair.]

GENERAL RULES
When this Part applies
23.1.  This Part applies where—
(a)
a defendant may not cross-examine in person a witness because of section 34 or section 35 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999(1) (Complainants in proceedings for sexual offences; Child complainants and other child witnesses); or
(b)
the court can prohibit a defendant from cross-examining in person a witness under section 36 of that Act(2) (Direction prohibiting accused from cross-examining particular witness).
[Note. Under section 34 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, no defendant charged with a sexual offence may cross-examine in person a witness who is the complainant, either—
(a)
in connection with that offence; or
(b)
in connection with any other offence (of whatever nature) with which that defendant is charged in the proceedings.
Under section 35 of the 1999 Act, no defendant charged with an offence listed in that section may cross-examine in person a protected witness, either—
(a)
in connection with that offence; or
(b)
in connection with any other offence (of whatever nature) with which that defendant is charged in the proceedings.
A ‘protected witness’ is one who—
(a)
either is the complainant or is alleged to have been a witness to the commission of the offence; and
(b)
either is a child, within the meaning of section 35, or is due to be cross-examined after giving evidence in chief—
(i)
by means of a video recording made when the witness was a child, or
(ii)
in any other way when the witness was a child.
Under section 36 of the 1999 Act, where neither section 34 nor section 35 applies the court may give a direction prohibiting the defendant from cross-examining, or further cross-examining, in person a witness, on application by the prosecutor or on the court’s own initiative. See also rules 23.3 to 23.7.]

Rule 23.1 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
Appointment of advocate to cross-examine witness
23.2.—(1) This rule applies where a defendant may not cross-examine in person a witness in consequence of—
(a)
the prohibition imposed by section 34 or section 35 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999; or
(b)
a prohibition imposed by the court under section 36 of the 1999 Act.
(2) The court must, as soon as practicable, explain in terms the defendant can understand (with help, if necessary)—
(a)
the prohibition and its effect;
(b)
that if the defendant will not be represented by a lawyer with a right of audience in the court for the purposes of the case then the defendant is entitled to arrange for such a lawyer to cross-examine the witness on his or her behalf;
(c)
that the defendant must notify the court officer of the identity of any such lawyer, with details of how to contact that person, by no later than a date set by the court; and
(d)
that if the defendant does not want to make such arrangements, or if the defendant gives no such notice by that date, then—
(i)
the court must decide whether it is necessary in the interests of justice to appoint such a lawyer to cross-examine the witness in the defendant’s interests, and
(ii)
if the court decides that that is necessary, the court will appoint a lawyer chosen by the court who will not be responsible to the defendant.
(3) Having given those explanations, the court must—
(a)
ask whether the defendant wants to arrange for a lawyer to cross-examine the witness, and set a date by when the defendant must notify the court officer of the identity of that lawyer if the answer to that question is ‘yes’; and
(b)
if the answer to that question is ‘no’, or if by the date set the defendant has given no such notice—
(i)
decide whether it is necessary in the interests of justice for the witness to be cross-examined by an advocate appointed to represent the defendant’s interests, and
(ii)
if the court decides that that is necessary, give directions for the appointment of such an advocate.
(4) The court may give the explanations and ask the questions required by this rule—
(a)
at a hearing, in public or in private; or
(b)
without a hearing, by written notice to the defendant.
(5) The court may extend (even after it has expired) the time limit that it sets under paragraph (3)(a)—
(a)
on application by the defendant; or
(b)
on its own initiative.
(6) Paragraphs (7), (8), (9) and (10) apply where the court appoints an advocate.
(7) The directions that the court gives under paragraph (3)(b)(ii) must provide for the supply to the advocate of a copy of—
(a)
all material served by one party on the other, whether before or after the advocate’s appointment, to which applies—
(i)
Part 8 (Initial details of the prosecution case),
(ii)
in the Crown Court, rule 3.19 (service of prosecution evidence in a case sent for trial),
(iii)
Part 16 (Written witness statements),
(iv)
Part 19 (Expert evidence),
(v)
Part 20 (Hearsay evidence),
(vi)
Part 21 (Evidence of bad character), or
(vii)
Part 22 (Evidence of a complainant’s previous sexual behaviour);
(b)
any material disclosed, given or served, whether before or after the advocate’s appointment, which is—
(i)
prosecution material disclosed to the defendant under section 3 (Initial duty of prosecutor to disclose) or section 7A (Continuing duty of prosecutor to disclose) of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996(3),
(ii)
a defence statement given by the defendant under section 5 (Compulsory disclosure by accused) or section 6 (Voluntary disclosure by accused) of the 1996 Act(4),
(iii)
a defence witness notice given by the defendant under section 6C of that Act(5) (Notification of intention to call defence witnesses), or
(iv)
an application by the defendant under section 8 of that Act(6) (Application by accused for disclosure);
(c)
any case management questionnaire prepared for the purposes of the trial or, as the case may be, the appeal; and
(d)
all case management directions given by the court for the purposes of the trial or the appeal.
(8) Where the defendant has given a defence statement—
(a)
section 8(2) of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 is modified to allow the advocate, as well as the defendant, to apply for an order for prosecution disclosure under that subsection if the advocate has reasonable cause to believe that there is prosecution material concerning the witness which is required by section 7A of the Act to be disclosed to the defendant and has not been; and
(b)
rule 15.5 (Defendant’s application for prosecution disclosure) applies to an application by the advocate as it does to an application by the defendant.
(9) Before receiving evidence the court must establish, with the active assistance of the parties and of the advocate, and in the absence of any jury in the Crown Court—
(a)
what issues will be the subject of the advocate’s cross-examination; and
(b)
whether the court’s permission is required for any proposed question, for example where Part 21 or Part 22 applies.
(10) The appointment terminates at the conclusion of the cross-examination of the witness.
[Note. See section 38 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999(7). Under section 38(8) the references in that section to a ‘legal representative’ are to a representative who is an advocate within the meaning of rule 2.2.
Under section 38(7) of the 1999 Act, where the court appoints an advocate Criminal Procedure Rules may apply with modifications any of the provisions of Part I of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. A summary of the disclosure requirements of the 1996 Act is at the end of Part 15 (Disclosure). Under section 5 of that Act, in the Crown Court the defendant must give a defence statement. Under section 6, in a magistrates’ court the defendant may give such a statement but need not do so. Under section 6C, in the Crown Court and in magistrates’ courts the defendant must give a defence witness notice indicating whether he or she intends to call any witnesses (other than him or herself) and, if so, identifying them. Under section 8 a defendant may apply for prosecution disclosure only if the defendant has given a defence statement.]

[Note. Part 3 contains rules about case management that apply at trial as well as during preparation for trial. The rules in this Part must be read in conjunction with those rules.]
When this Part applies
24.1.—(1) This Part applies in a magistrates’ court where the court tries a case or the defendant pleads guilty.
(2) Where the defendant is under 18, in this Part—
(a)
a reference to convicting the defendant includes a reference to finding the defendant guilty of an offence; and
(b)
a reference to sentence includes a reference to an order made on a finding of guilt.
[Note. A magistrates’ court’s powers to try an allegation of an offence are contained in section 2 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(1). In relation to a defendant under 18, they are contained in sections 45, 46 and 48 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933(2).
See also section 18 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1963(3), section 47 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998(4) and [F2section 27 of the Sentencing Act 2020].
The exercise of the court’s powers is affected by—
(a)
the classification of the offence (and the general rule, subject to exceptions, is that a magistrates’ court must try—
(i)
an offence classified as one that can be tried only in a magistrates’ court (in other legislation, described as triable only summarily), and
(ii)
an offence classified as one that can be tried either in a magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court (in other legislation, described as triable either way) that has been allocated for trial in a magistrates’ court); and
(b)
the defendant’s age (and the general rule, subject to exceptions, is that an allegation of an offence against a defendant under 18 must be tried in a magistrates’ court sitting as a youth court, irrespective of the classification of the offence and without allocation for trial there).
Under sections 10, 14, 27A, 121 and 148 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(5) and the Justices of the Peace Rules 2016(6), the court—
(a)
must comprise at least two but not more than three justices, or a District Judge (Magistrates’ Courts) (but a single member can adjourn the hearing);
(b)
must not include any member who adjudicated at a hearing to which rule 44.2 applies (defendant’s declaration of no knowledge of hearing);
(c)
when reaching a verdict, must not include any member who was absent from any part of the hearing;
(d)
when passing sentence, need not include any of the members who reached the verdict (but may do so).
Under section 16A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(7), the court may comprise a single justice where—
(a)
the offence charged is a summary offence not punishable with imprisonment;
(b)
the defendant was at least 18 years old when charged [F3or is a corporation];
(c)
the court is satisfied that specified documents giving notice of the procedure under that section and containing other specified information have been served on the defendant; and
(d)
the defendant has not served notice of an intention to plead not guilty, or of a desire not to be tried in accordance with that section.
Under section 45 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933(8) and under the Justices of the Peace Rules 2016, where the court is a youth court comprising justices each member must be authorised to sit as a member of that youth court.
Under section 150 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(9), where two or more justices are present one may act on behalf of all.
Section 59 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933(10) requires that—
(a)
the expressions ‘conviction’ and ‘sentence’ must not be used by a magistrates’ court dealing with a defendant under 18; and
(b)
a reference in legislation to a defendant who is convicted, to a conviction, or to a sentence, must be read as including a reference to a defendant who is found guilty of an offence, a finding of guilt, or an order made on a finding of guilt, respectively.
Under section 14 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980, proceedings which begin with a summons or requisition will become void if the defendant, at any time during or after the trial, makes a statutory declaration that he or she did not know of them until a date after the trial began. See rule 44.2.
Under section 142 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980—
(a)
where a defendant is convicted by a magistrates’ court, the court may order that the case should be heard again by different justices; and
(b)
the court may vary or rescind an order which it has made when dealing with a convicted defendant,
if in either case it appears to the court to be in the interests of justice to do so. See rule 44.3.
See also Part 32 (Breach, revocation and amendment of community and other orders). Rule 32.4 (Procedure on application by responsible officer) applies rules in this Part to the procedure with which that rule deals.]

Rule 24.2 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
Procedure on plea of not guilty
24.3.—(1) This rule applies—
(a)
if the defendant has—
(i)
entered a plea of not guilty, or
(ii)
not entered a plea; or
(b)
if, in either case, it appears to the court that there may be grounds for making a hospital order without convicting the defendant.
(2) If a not guilty plea was taken on a previous occasion, the justices’ legal adviser or the court must ask the defendant to confirm that plea.
(3) In the following sequence—
(a)
the prosecutor may summarise the prosecution case, concisely identifying the relevant law, outlining the facts and indicating the matters likely to be in dispute;
(b)
to help the members of the court to understand the case and resolve any issue in it, the court may invite the defendant concisely to identify what is in issue;
(c)
the prosecutor must introduce the evidence on which the prosecution case relies;
(d)
at the conclusion of the prosecution case, on the defendant’s application or on its own initiative, the court—
(i)
may acquit on the ground that the prosecution evidence is insufficient for any reasonable court properly to convict, but
(ii)
must not do so unless the prosecutor has had an opportunity to make representations;
(e)
the justices’ legal adviser or the court must explain, in terms the defendant can understand (with help, if necessary)—
(i)
the right to give evidence, and
(ii)
the potential effect of not doing so at all, or of refusing to answer a question while doing so;
(f)
the defendant may introduce evidence;
(g)
a party may introduce further evidence if it is then admissible (for example, because it is in rebuttal of evidence already introduced);
(h)
the prosecutor may make final representations in support of the prosecution case, where—
(i)
the defendant is represented by a legal representative, or
(ii)
whether represented or not, the defendant has introduced evidence other than his or her own; and
(i)
the defendant may make final representations in support of the defence case.
(4) Where a party wants to introduce evidence or make representations after that party’s opportunity to do so under paragraph (3), the court—
(a)
may refuse to receive any such evidence or representations; and
(b)
must not receive any such evidence or representations after it has announced its verdict.
(5) If the court—
(a)
convicts the defendant; or
(b)
makes a hospital order instead of doing so,
it must give sufficient reasons to explain its decision.
(6) If the court acquits the defendant, it may—
(a)
give an explanation of its decision; and
(b)
exercise any power it has to make—
(i)
a behaviour order, or
(ii)
a costs order.
[Note. See section 9 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(13).
Under section 37(3) of the Mental Health Act 1983(14), if the court is satisfied that the defendant did the act or made the omission alleged, then it may make a hospital order without convicting the defendant.
Under section 35 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994(15), the court may draw such inferences as appear proper from a defendant’s failure to give evidence, or refusal without good cause to answer a question while doing so. The procedure set out in rule 24.3(3)(e) is prescribed by that section.
The admissibility of evidence that a party introduces is governed by rules of evidence.
Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865(16) and section 3 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1898(17) restrict the circumstances in which the prosecutor may make final representations without the court’s permission.
See rule 24.11 for the procedure if the court convicts the defendant.

Rule 24.3 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
Evidence of a witness in person
24.4.—(1) This rule applies where a party wants to introduce evidence by calling a witness to give that evidence in person.
(2) Unless the court otherwise directs—
(a)
a witness waiting to give evidence must not wait inside the courtroom, unless that witness is—
(i)
a party, or
(ii)
an expert witness;
(b)
a witness who gives evidence in the courtroom must do so from the place provided for that purpose; and
(c)
a witness’ address must not be announced unless it is relevant to an issue in the case.
[F4(3) Before the witness gives evidence—
(a)
the party who introduces the witness’ evidence must explain how that evidence is admissible, unless it is only evidence of fact within the witness’ direct knowledge; and
(b)
the witness must take an oath or affirm, unless other legislation otherwise provides.]
(4) In the following sequence—
(a)
the party who calls a witness must ask questions in examination-in-chief;
(b)
every other party may ask questions in cross-examination; and
(c)
the party who called the witness may ask questions in re-examination.
(5) If other legislation so permits, at any time while giving evidence a witness may refer to a record of that witness’ recollection of events.
(6) The justices’ legal adviser or the court may—
(a)
ask a witness questions; and in particular
(b)
where the defendant is not represented, ask any question necessary in the defendant’s interests.
[Note. Section 53 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999(18) provides that everyone is competent to give evidence in criminal proceedings unless unable to understand questions put or give intelligible answers. See also section 1 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1898(19).
[F5Part 19 contains rules about the introduction of evidence of expert opinion. Part 20 contains rules about the introduction of hearsay evidence.]
Sections 1, 3, 5 and 6 of the Oaths Act 1978(20) provide for the taking of oaths and the making of affirmations, and for the words that must be used. Section 28 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1963(21) provides that in a youth court, and where a witness in any court is under 18, an oath must include the words ‘I promise’ in place of the words ‘I swear’. Under sections 55 and 56 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, a person may give evidence without taking an oath, or making an affirmation, where that person (i) is under 14 or (ii) has an insufficient appreciation of the solemnity of the occasion and of the particular responsibility to tell the truth which is involved in taking an oath.
The questions that may be put to a witness—
(a)
by a party are governed by rules of evidence, for example—
(i)
the rule that a question must be relevant to what is in issue,
(ii)
the rule that the party who calls a witness must not ask that witness a leading question about what is in dispute, and
(iii)
the rule that a party who calls a witness may contradict that witness only in limited circumstances (see section 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865)(22);
(b)
by the justices’ legal adviser or the court are in their discretion, but that is subject to—
(i)
rules of evidence, and
(ii)
rule 1.3 (the application by the court of the overriding objective).
Under sections 34, 35 and 36 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999(23), a defendant who is not represented may not cross-examine a witness where—
(a)
the defendant is charged with a sexual offence against the witness;
(b)
the defendant is charged with a sexual offence, or one of certain other offences, and the witness is a child; or
(c)
the court prohibits the defendant from cross-examining the witness.
Part 23 contains rules relevant to restrictions on cross-examination.
Under section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003(24), a witness may refresh his or her memory by referring to a record made before the hearing, either contained in a document made or verified by the witness, or in the transcript of a sound recording, if—
(a)
the witness states that it records his or her recollection of events at that earlier time; and
(b)
that recollection is likely to have been significantly better when the record was made than at the time of the hearing.
In some circumstances, a witness may give evidence in accordance with special measures directed by the court under section 19 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999(25), or by live link under section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988(26) or section 51 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Part 18 contains relevant rules.]

(a)
Part 16 (Written witness statements);
(b)
Part 19 (Expert evidence); or
(c)
Part 20 (Hearsay evidence).
[F6(2) That party must explain how the evidence is admissible unless it is—
(a)
evidence of fact within the direct knowledge of the person who made the written statement served under rule 16.4 (Written witness statement in evidence);
(b)
contained in an expert’s report served under rule 19.3 (Introduction of expert evidence); or
(c)
identified as hearsay in a notice served under rule 20.2 (Notice to introduce hearsay evidence).]
[F7(3)] If the court admits such evidence—
(a)
the court must read the statement; and
(b)
unless the court otherwise directs, if any member of the public, including any reporter, is present, each relevant part of the statement must be read or summarised aloud.
[Note. See Parts 16, 19 and 20, and the other legislation to which those Parts apply. The admissibility of evidence that a party introduces is governed by rules of evidence.
[F8A written witness statement to which Part 16 applies may only be introduced in evidence if there has been no objection within the time limit to which rule 16.4 refers.
An expert report to which Part 19 applies may only be introduced in evidence if it has been served in accordance with rule 19.3.
Rule 20.3 provides for opposing the introduction of hearsay evidence, including such evidence in a document.
Where a witness gives evidence in person, a previous written statement by that witness may be admissible as evidence under section 119 (Inconsistent statements) or under section 120 (Other previous statements of witnesses) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.]]

Under [F36section 35 of the Sentencing Act 2020], the court may require a defendant who is an individual to provide a statement of assets and other financial circumstances if the defendant—
(a)
serves notice of guilty plea, where rule 24.8 (Written guilty plea: special rules) applies; or
(b)
is convicted.
Under section 20A of the Criminal Justice Act 1991(45), it is an offence for a defendant knowingly or recklessly to make a false or incomplete statement of assets or other financial circumstances, or to fail to provide such a statement, in response to a request by a court officer on behalf of the court.
Under [F37section 30 of the Sentencing Act 2020], the general rule (subject to exceptions) is that the court must obtain and consider a pre-sentence report—
(a)
where it is considering a custodial sentence or a community sentence;
(b)
where it thinks the defendant may pose a significant risk of causing serious harm to the public by further offending.
Under [F38section 32(3) of the Sentencing Act 2020], where the court obtains a written pre-sentence report about a defendant who is under 18, it may direct that information in it must be withheld, if it would be likely to create a risk of significant harm to the defendant.
For the circumstances in which a magistrates’ court may (and, in some cases, must) remit the defendant to a youth court for sentence, see [F39section 25 of the Sentencing Act 2020].
The Sentencing Council may issue sentencing guidelines under section 120 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009(46).
For the circumstances in which a court may (and, in some cases, must) order the endorsement of a defendant’s driving record, or the disqualification of a defendant from driving, see sections 34, 35 and 44 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988(47). Under that legislation, in some circumstances the court has discretion not to make such an order. See also rule 29.1.
The evidence that may be introduced is subject to rules of evidence.
In addition to the specific powers to which this rule applies, the court has a general power to adjourn a trial: see rule 24.2.
Under [F40section 52(4) of the Sentencing Act 2020], Criminal Procedure Rules may prescribe cases in which there do not apply the court’s usual duties to give reasons and explanations. Written notice of the effect of some sentences is required by rule 28.2 (Notice of requirements of suspended sentence or community, etc. order), rule 28.3 (Notification requirements) and rule 30.2 (notice of fine or other financial order).
[F41Under section 3 of the Sentencing Act 2020, if (among other things) the defendant consents, the court may defer sentence for up to 6 months, for the purpose of allowing it to take account of the defendant’s conduct after conviction, or any change in the defendant’s circumstances.
For the circumstances in which a magistrates’ court may (and, in some cases, must) commit a defendant to the Crown Court for sentence or for the making of other orders beyond a magistrates’ court’s powers, see—
(a)
sections 14, 15, 16, 16A, 17, 18, 19 and 20 of the Sentencing Act 2020;

(c)
paragraph 11 of Schedule 16 to the 2020 Act.
See section 70(5) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 for the court’s power to make the statement to which this rule refers.

Rule 24.11 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
Procedure where a party is absent
24.12.—(1) This rule—
(a)
applies where a party is absent; but
(b)
does not apply where—
(i)
the defendant has served a notice of guilty plea under rule 24.8 (Written guilty plea: special rules), or
(ii)
the court tries a case under rule 24.9 (Single justice procedure: special rules).
(2) Where the prosecutor is absent, the court may—
(a)
if it has received evidence, deal with the case as if the prosecutor were present; and
(b)
in any other case—
(i)
enquire into the reasons for the prosecutor’s absence, and
(ii)
if satisfied there is no good reason, exercise its power to dismiss the allegation.
(3) Where the defendant is absent the general rule is that the court must proceed as if the defendant were present and had pleaded not guilty (unless a plea already has been taken), but the general rule—
(a)
does not apply if the defendant is under 18;
(b)
is subject to the court being satisfied that—
(i)
any summons or requisition was served on the defendant a reasonable time before the hearing, or
(ii)
in a case in which the hearing has been adjourned, the defendant had reasonable notice of where and when it would resume; and
(c)
is subject to rule 24.11(10)(a) (restrictions on passing sentence in the defendant’s absence).
(4) Where the defendant is absent, the court—
(a)
must exercise its power to issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest and detention in the terms required by rule 13.3(3) (Terms of a warrant for detention or imprisonment), if it passes a custodial sentence; and
(b)
may exercise its power to issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest in any other case, if it does not apply the general rule in paragraph (3) of this rule about proceeding in the defendant’s absence.
[Note. See sections 11, 15 and 16 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(48).
Under section 27 of the 1980 Act, where a magistrates’ court dismisses an allegation of an offence classified as one that can be tried either in a magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court (in other legislation, described as triable either way), that dismissal has the same effect as an acquittal in the Crown Court.
Under section 11 of the 1980 Act, the court may pass a custodial sentence in the defendant’s absence if the case started with the defendant’s arrest and charge (and not with a summons or requisition). Section 11(3A) requires that, in that event, the defendant must be brought before the court before being taken to a prison or other institution to begin serving that sentence: see also rule 13.3. Under section 7(1) of the Bail Act 1976(49), the court has power to issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant released on bail who has failed to attend court when due to do so.
Under section 13 of the 1980 Act(50), the court has power to issue a warrant for the arrest of an absent defendant, instead of proceeding, where—
(1) the case started with—
(a)
the defendant’s arrest and charge, or
(b)
a summons or requisition, if—
(i)
the court is satisfied that that summons or requisition was served on the defendant a reasonable time before the hearing, or
(ii)
the defendant was present when the hearing was arranged; and
(2) the offence is punishable with imprisonment; or
(3) the defendant has been convicted and the court considers imposing a disqualification.]

[Note. Part 3 contains rules about case management that apply during preparation for trial and at trial. The rules in this Part must be read in conjunction with those rules.]
When this Part applies
25.1.  This Part applies in the Crown Court where the court tries a case or the defendant pleads guilty.
[Note. The Crown Court’s powers to try an allegation of an offence are contained in sections 45 and 46 of the Senior Courts Act 1981(1).
The exercise of the court’s powers is affected by—
(a)
the classification of the offence (and the general rule, subject to exceptions, is that the Crown Court must try—
(i)
an offence classified as one that can be tried only in the Crown Court (in other legislation, described as triable only on indictment), and
(ii)
an offence classified as one that can be tried either in a magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court (in other legislation, described as triable either way) that has been allocated for trial in the Crown Court); and
(b)
the defendant’s age (and the general rule is that an allegation of an offence against a defendant under 18 must be tried in a magistrates’ court sitting as a youth court, irrespective of the classification of the offence and without allocation for trial there, unless the offence is—
(i)
one of homicide,
(ii)
one for which a convicted adult could be imprisoned for 14 years or more,
(iii)
one of certain specified offences involving firearms, or
(iv)
one of certain specified sexual offences).
See sections 17 and 24 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(2) and section 51A of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998(3).
Under section 34A of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933(4), the court—
(a)
may require the defendant’s parents or guardian to attend court with the defendant, where the defendant is under 18; and
(b)
must do so, where the defendant is under 16,
unless satisfied that that would be unreasonable. Part 46 (Representatives) contains rules allowing a parent, guardian or other supporting adult to help a defendant under 18.]

Rule 25.1 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
General powers and requirements
25.2.—(1) Where this Part applies, the general rule is that—
(a)
the trial must be in public, but that is subject to the court’s power to—
(i)
impose a restriction on reporting what takes place at a public hearing, or public access to what otherwise would be a public hearing,
(ii)
withhold information from the public during a public hearing, or
(iii)
order a trial in private;
(b)
the court must not proceed if the defendant is absent, unless the court is satisfied that—
(i)
the defendant has waived the right to attend, and
(ii)
the trial will be fair despite the defendant’s absence; and
(c)
the court must not sentence the defendant to imprisonment or detention unless—
(i)
the defendant has a legal representative,
(ii)
the defendant has been sentenced to imprisonment or detention on a previous occasion in the United Kingdom, or
(iii)
the defendant could have been represented under legal aid but is not because [F2section 226(7), (8) of the Sentencing Act 2020] applies to him or her.
[F3(2) Before proceeding to trial the court must—
(a)
if more than one indictment has been preferred or proposed—
(i)
identify the indictment or indictments on which the prosecutor wants the defendant to be tried, and
(ii)
identify any indictment or count in an indictment on which the prosecutor does not want to proceed;
(b)
obtain the prosecutor’s confirmation, in writing or orally, that each indictment on which the defendant is about to be tried sets out—
(i)
a statement of each offence that the prosecutor wants the court to try, and
(ii)
such particulars of the conduct constituting the commission of each such offence as the prosecutor relies upon to make clear what is alleged;
(c)
ensure that the defendant is correctly identified by each indictment on which the defendant is about to be tried;
(d)
satisfy itself that each allegation has been explained to the defendant, in terms the defendant can understand (with help, if necessary); and
(e)
invite any objection to the terms or validity of any indictment on which the defendant is about to be tried.]
(3) The court may adjourn the trial at any stage.
[F4(4) Subject to paragraph (5), unless the court otherwise directs no further proceedings may be taken on an indictment or count in an indictment on which under this rule the prosecutor chooses not to proceed.
(5) Paragraph (4) does not apply to any count in an indictment which becomes a count in the indictment required by rule 25.16(3)(e) (substituted indictment for sentencing purposes).]
[Note. [F5See section 226(7), (8) of the Sentencing Act 2020, which] applies to a defendant if—
(a)
representation was made available to the defendant for the purposes of the proceedings under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 but was withdrawn because of the defendant’s conduct or because it appeared that the defendant’s financial resources were such that he or she was not eligible for such representation;
(b)
the defendant applied for such representation and the application was refused because it appeared that the defendant’s financial resources were such that he or she was not eligible for such representation; or
(c)
having been informed of the right to apply for such representation and having had the opportunity to do so, the defendant refused or failed to apply.
Part 6 contains rules about reporting, etc. restrictions. For a list of the court’s powers to impose reporting and access restrictions, see the note to rule 6.1.
Part 10 contains rules about the content and service of indictments. Under section 2(6ZA) of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933(5), no objection to the indictment may be taken after the trial commences by reason of any failure to observe those rules.]

applies where—

the defendant pleads not guilty,
(ii)

(2) The court must select a jury to try the case from the panel, or part of the panel, of jurors summoned by the Lord Chancellor to attend at that time and place.
(3) Where it appears that too few jurors to constitute a jury will be available from among those so summoned, the court—
(a)
may exercise its own power to summon others in the court room, or in the vicinity, up to the number likely to be required, and add their names to the panel summoned by the Lord Chancellor; but

(c)
the court will discharge any extra juror or jurors remaining by no later than the beginning of the prosecution evidence; and

(a)
the defendant pleads not guilty; or

(a)
where there is a jury, the court must—
(i)
inform the jurors of each offence charged in the indictment to which the defendant pleads not guilty, and
(ii)
explain to the jurors that it is their duty, after hearing the evidence, to decide whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of each offence;
(b)
the prosecutor may summarise the prosecution case, concisely outlining the facts and the matters likely to be in dispute;
(c)
where there is a jury, to help the jurors to understand the case and resolve any issue in it the court may—
(i)
invite the defendant concisely to identify what is in issue, if necessary in terms approved by the court, and
(ii)
if the defendant declines to do so, direct that the jurors be given a copy of any defence statement served under rule 15.4 (Defence disclosure), edited if necessary to exclude any reference to inappropriate matters or to matters evidence of which would not be admissible;
(d)
the prosecutor must introduce the evidence on which the prosecution case relies;
(e)
subject to paragraph (3), at the end of the prosecution evidence, on the defendant’s application or on its own initiative, the court—
(i)
may direct the jury (if there is one) to acquit on the ground that the prosecution evidence is insufficient for any reasonable court properly to convict, but
(ii)
must not do so unless the prosecutor has had an opportunity to make representations;
(f)
subject to paragraph (4), at the end of the prosecution evidence, the court must ask whether the defendant intends to give evidence in person and, if the answer is ‘no’, then the court must satisfy itself that there has been explained to the defendant, in terms the defendant can understand (with help, if necessary)—
(i)
the right to give evidence in person, and
(ii)
that if the defendant does not give evidence in person, or refuses to answer a question while giving evidence, the court may draw such inferences as seem proper;
(g)
the defendant may summarise the defence case, if he or she intends to call at least one witness other than him or herself to give evidence in person about the facts of the case;
(h)
in this order (or in a different order, if the court so directs) the defendant may—
(i)
give evidence in person,
(ii)
call another witness, or witnesses, to give evidence in person, and
(iii)
introduce any other evidence;
(i)
a party may introduce further evidence if it is then admissible (for example, because it is in rebuttal of evidence already introduced);
(j)
the prosecutor may make final representations, where—
(i)
the defendant has a legal representative,
(ii)
the defendant has called at least one witness, other than the defendant him or herself, to give evidence in person about the facts of the case, or
(iii)
the court so permits; and
(k)
the defendant may make final representations.
(3) Paragraph (2)(e) does not apply in relation to a charge of murder, manslaughter, attempted murder, or causing harm contrary to section 18 or 20 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861(13) until the court has heard all the evidence (including any defence evidence), where the defendant is charged with—
(a)
any of those offences; and
(b)
an offence of causing or allowing a child or vulnerable adult to die or to suffer serious physical harm, contrary to section 5 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004(14).
(4) Paragraph (2)(f) does not apply where it appears to the court that, taking account of all the circumstances, the defendant’s physical or mental condition makes it undesirable for the defendant to give evidence in person.
(5) Where there is more than one defendant, this rule applies to each in the order their names appear in the indictment, or in an order directed by the court.
(6) Unless the jury (if there is one) has retired to consider its verdict, the court may allow a party to introduce evidence, or make representations, after that party’s opportunity to do so under paragraph (2).
(7) Unless the jury has already reached a verdict on a count, the court may exercise its power to—
(a)
discharge the jury from reaching a verdict on that count;
(b)
direct the jury to acquit the defendant on that count; or
(c)
invite the jury to convict the defendant, if the defendant pleads guilty to the offence charged by that count.
[Note. See also rule 3.32 (Arraigning the defendant on the indictment).
Under section 6E of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996(15), the court may make the direction for which rule 25.9(2)(c)(ii) provides, on application or on the court’s own initiative.
The admissibility of evidence that a party introduces is governed by rules of evidence.
Under section 35 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994(16), the court may draw such inferences as appear proper from a defendant’s failure to give evidence, or refusal without good cause to answer a question while doing so. The procedure set out in rule 25.9(2)(f) and (4) is prescribed by that section.
Section 2 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1898(17) restricts the circumstances in which the defendant may summarise the defence case before introducing evidence.
Section 79 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984(18) requires a defendant who wishes to give evidence in person to do so before calling any other witness, unless the court otherwise permits.
Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865(19) and section 3 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1898(20) restrict the circumstances in which the prosecutor may make final representations without the court’s permission. See also section 1 of the Criminal Procedure (Right of Reply) Act 1964(21).
The procedure set out in rule 25.9(3) is prescribed by sections 6 and 6A of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004(22).
Under section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act 1967(23), the court may direct the jury to acquit where the prosecutor offers no evidence.

Rule 25.10 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
Evidence of a witness in person
25.11.—(1) This rule applies where a party wants to introduce evidence by calling a witness to give that evidence in person.
(2) Unless the court otherwise directs—
(a)
a witness waiting to give evidence must not wait inside the courtroom, unless that witness is—
(i)
a party, or
(ii)
an expert witness;
(b)
a witness who gives evidence in the courtroom must do so from the place provided for that purpose; and
(c)
a witness’ address—
(i)
must not be given in public unless the address is relevant to an issue in the case, and
(ii)
may be given in writing to the court, parties and jury.
[F8(3) Before the witness gives evidence—
(a)
the party who introduces the witness’ evidence must explain how that evidence is admissible, unless it is only evidence of fact within the witness’ direct knowledge; and
(b)
the witness must take an oath or affirm, unless other legislation otherwise provides.]
(4) In the following sequence—
(a)
the party who calls a witness may ask questions in examination-in-chief;
(b)
if the witness gives evidence for the prosecution—
(i)
the defendant, if there is only one, may ask questions in cross-examination, or
(ii)
subject to the court’s directions, each defendant, if there is more than one, may ask such questions, in the order their names appear in the indictment or as directed by the court;
(c)
if the witness gives evidence for a defendant—
(i)
subject to the court’s directions, each other defendant, if there is more than one, may ask questions in cross-examination, in the order their names appear in the indictment or as directed by the court, and
(ii)
the prosecutor may ask such questions; and
(d)
the party who called the witness may ask questions in re-examination arising out of any cross-examination.
(5) If other legislation so permits, at any time while giving evidence a witness may refer to a record of that witness’ recollection of events.
(6) The court may—
(a)
ask a witness questions; and in particular
(b)
where the defendant is not represented, ask a witness any question necessary in the defendant’s interests.
[Note. Section 53 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999(25) provides that everyone is competent to give evidence in criminal proceedings unless unable to understand questions put or give intelligible answers. See also section 1 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1898(26).
[F9Part 19 contains rules about the introduction of evidence of expert opinion. Part 20 contains rules about the introduction of hearsay evidence.]
Sections 1, 3, 5 and 6 of the Oaths Act 1978(27) provide for the taking of oaths and the making of affirmations, and for the words that must be used. Section 28 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1963(28) provides that in a youth court, and where a witness in any court is under 18, an oath must include the words ‘I promise’ in place of the words ‘I swear’. Under sections 55 and 56 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, a person may give evidence without taking an oath, or making an affirmation, where that person (i) is under 14 or (ii) has an insufficient appreciation of the solemnity of the occasion and of the particular responsibility to tell the truth which is involved in taking an oath.
The questions that may be put to a witness—
(a)
by a party are governed by rules of evidence, for example—
(i)
the rule that a question must be relevant to what is in issue,
(ii)
the rule that the party who calls a witness must not ask that witness a leading question about what is in dispute, and
(iii)
the rule that a party who calls a witness may contradict that witness only in limited circumstances (see section 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1865)(29);
(b)
by the court are in its discretion, but that is subject to—
(i)
rules of evidence, and
(ii)
rule 1.3 (the application by the court of the overriding objective).
Under sections 34, 35 and 36 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999(30), a defendant who is not represented may not cross-examine a witness where—
(a)
the defendant is charged with a sexual offence against the witness;
(b)
the defendant is charged with a sexual offence, or one of certain other offences, and the witness is a child; or
(c)
the court prohibits the defendant from cross-examining the witness.
Part 23 contains rules relevant to restrictions on cross-examination.
Under section 139 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003(31), a witness may refresh his or her memory by referring to a record made earlier, either contained in a document made or verified by the witness, or in the transcript of a sound recording, if—
(a)
the witness states that it records his or her recollection of events at that earlier time; and
(b)
that recollection is likely to have been significantly better when the record was made than by the time the witness gives evidence in person.
In some circumstances, a witness may give evidence in accordance with special measures directed by the court under section 19 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999(32), or by live link under section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988(33) or section 51 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

Rule 25.11 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
Evidence of a witness in writing
25.12.—(1) This rule applies where a party wants to introduce in evidence the written statement of a witness to which applies—
(a)
Part 16 (Written witness statements);
(b)
Part 19 (Expert evidence); or
(c)
Part 20 (Hearsay evidence).
[F10(2) That party must explain how the evidence is admissible unless it is—
(a)
evidence of fact within the direct knowledge of the person who made the written statement served under rule 16.4 (Written witness statement in evidence);
(b)
contained in an expert’s report served under rule 19.3 (Introduction of expert evidence); or
(c)
identified as hearsay in a notice served under rule 20.2 (Notice to introduce hearsay evidence).]
[F11(3)] If the court admits such evidence each relevant part of the statement must be read or summarised aloud, unless the court otherwise directs.
[Note. See Parts 16, 19 and 20, and the other legislation to which those Parts apply. The admissibility of evidence that a party introduces is governed by rules of evidence.
A written witness statement to which Part 16 applies may only be introduced in evidence if there has been no objection within the time limit to which rule 16.4 refers.
An expert report to which Part 19 applies may only be introduced in evidence if it has been served in accordance with rule 19.3.
Rule 20.3 provides for opposing the introduction of hearsay evidence, including such evidence in a document.
Where a witness gives evidence in person, a previous written statement by that witness may be admissible as evidence under section 119 (Inconsistent statements) or under section 120 (Other previous statements of witnesses) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.]

Directions to the jury and taking the verdict
25.14.—(1) This rule applies where there is a jury.
(2) The court must give the jury directions about the relevant law at any time at which to do so will assist jurors to evaluate the evidence.
(3) After following the sequence in rule 25.9 (Procedure on plea of not guilty), the court must—
[F12(a)
to help the jury to come to a verdict—
(i)
give jurors directions about the relevant law, and
(ii)
summarise for them, to such extent as is necessary, the evidence relevant to the issues they must decide;
(b)
give those directions orally and, as a general rule, in writing as well;]
(c)
direct the jury to retire to consider its verdict;
(d)
if necessary, recall the jury—
(i)
to answer jurors’ questions, or
(ii)
to give directions, or further directions, about considering and delivering its verdict or verdicts, including, if appropriate, directions about reaching a verdict by a majority;
(e)
in a case in which the jury is required to return a single verdict—
(i)
recall the jury (unless already recalled) when it informs the court that it has reached its verdict, and
(ii)
direct the delivery of that verdict there and then;
(f)
in a case in which the jury is required to return two or more verdicts—
(i)
recall the jury (unless already recalled) when it informs the court that it has reached a verdict or verdicts, and
(ii)
ask the jury whether its members all agree on every verdict required;
(g)
if the answer to that question is ‘yes’, direct the delivery of each of those verdicts there and then; and
(h)
if the answer to that question is ‘no’—
(i)
direct the delivery there and then of any unanimous verdict that has been reached, or
(ii)
postpone the taking of any such verdict while the jury considers each other verdict required.
[F13(4) Directions to the jury under paragraph (3)(a) may include questions that the court invites jurors to answer in coming to a verdict.
(5) The court may give the jury other assistance in writing.]

Under section 142 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(12), in some cases a magistrates’ court can vary or rescind a sentence or other order that it has imposed or made, if that appears to be in the interests of justice. The power cannot be exercised if the Crown Court or the High Court has determined an appeal about that sentence or order. See also rule 44.3 (Setting aside a conviction or varying a costs etc. order), which governs the exercise by a magistrates’ court of the power conferred by section 142 of the 1980 Act in the circumstances to which that rule applies.
[F17Under section 16M of the 1980 Acta magistrates’ court can set aside a penalty imposed under section 16I of the Act on a defendant who accepts the automatic online conviction option under section 16H if the amount of the penalty appears to the court to be unjust. If the court sets aside such a penalty it may impose any sentence that it could have imposed for the offence if the defendant had pleaded guilty at the first opportunity.]
Under [F18section 385 of the Sentencing Act 2020], the Crown Court can vary or rescind a sentence or other order that it has imposed or made. The power cannot be exercised—
(a)
after the period of 56 days beginning with the sentence or order (but see the note below); or
(b)
if an appeal or application for permission to appeal against that sentence or order has been determined.
Under [F18section 385(7) of that Act], Criminal Procedure Rules can extend that period of 56 days where another defendant is tried separately in the Crown Court on the same or related facts alleged in one or more indictments.]

Application to review sentence because of assistance given or withheld
28.11.—(1) This rule applies where the Crown Court can reduce or increase a sentence on application by a prosecutor in a case in which—
(a)
since being sentenced, the defendant has assisted, or has agreed to assist, an investigator or prosecutor in relation to an offence; or
(b)
since receiving a reduced sentence for agreeing to give such assistance, the defendant has failed to do so.
(2) A prosecutor who wants the court to exercise that power must—
(a)
apply in writing as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the grounds for doing so;
(b)
serve the application on—
(i)
the court officer, and
(ii)
the defendant; and
(c)
in the application—
(i)
explain why the sentence should be reduced, or increased, as appropriate, and
(ii)
identify any other matter relevant to the court’s decision, including any sentencing guideline or guideline case.
(3) The general rule is that the application must be determined by the judge who passed the sentence, unless that judge is unavailable.
(4) The court must not determine the application in the defendant’s absence unless the defendant has had an opportunity to make representations at a hearing (whether or not the defendant in fact attends).
[Note. Under [F43section 74 of the Sentencing Act 2020], the Crown Court may pass a lesser sentence than it otherwise would have passed because the defendant has assisted, or has agreed to assist, an investigator or prosecutor in relation to an offence.
Under [F44sections 387 and 388 of the 2020 Act], where the Crown Court has sentenced a defendant a prosecutor may apply to the court—
(a)
to reduce the sentence, if the defendant subsequently assists, or agrees to assist, in the investigation or prosecution of an offence; or
(b)
to increase a reduced sentence to that which the court otherwise would have passed, if the defendant agreed to give such assistance but subsequently has knowingly failed to do so.
Such an application may be made only where the defendant is still serving the sentence and the prosecutor thinks it is in the interests of justice to apply.]

committed for sentence under section 18 or 19, as the case may be, of the Sentencing Act 2020, and
(ii)
in respect of which the magistrates’ court did not state the opinion to which section 18(4) or 19(3) of that Act refers;
(b)
an offence committed for sentence under section 20 of the 2020 Act; and

an offence—
(i)
committed to the Crown Court under section 70 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and
(ii)
in respect of which the magistrates’ court did not make the statement to which section 70(5) of that Act refers.
[Note. A magistrates’ court may commit a convicted defendant to the Crown Court for sentence under—
(a)
section 14 of the Sentencing Act 2020 (Committal for sentence on summary trial of offence triable either way: adults and corporations) where the defendant is over 18 or is a corporation, the offence is one triable either way and the court is of the opinion that the offence of which the defendant has been convicted, or the combination of that offence and one or more offences associated with it, was so serious that the Crown Court should have the power to deal with the defendant in any way that that court could have done if the defendant had been convicted there;
(b)
section 16 of the 2020 Act (Committal for sentence of young offenders on summary trial of certain serious offences) where the defendant is under 18, the offence of which the defendant has been convicted is one to which section 16 refers (offences punishable with imprisonment for 14 years or more and certain sexual offences), and the court is of the opinion that the offence of which the defendant has been convicted, or the combination of that offence and one or more offences associated with it, was such that the Crown Court should have the power to impose a sentence of detention under section 250 of the Act;
(c)
section 16A of the 2020 Act (Committal for sentence of young offenders on summary trial of certain terrorist offences) where the defendant is under 18, the offence of which the defendant has been convicted is one within section 252A of the Act (terrorism offences attracting special sentence for offenders of particular concern) and the court is of the opinion that the offence of which the defendant has been convicted, or the combination of that offence and one or more offences associated with it, was such that the Crown Court should have the power to impose a sentence of detention for more than 2 years under section 252A;
(d)
section 18 of the 2020 Act (Committal for sentence on indication of guilty plea to offence triable either way: adult offenders) where the defendant is over 18 and the court has sent the defendant to the Crown Court for trial for a related offence;
(e)
section 19 of the 2020 Act (Committal for sentence on indication of guilty plea by child with related offences) where the defendant is under 18, the court has sent the defendant to the Crown Court for trial for a related offence, and the offence of which the defendant has been convicted is one to which section 19 refers (offences punishable with imprisonment for 14 years or more and certain sexual offences); or
(f)
section 20 of the 2020 Act (Committal in certain cases where offender committed in respect of another offence) where the court commits the defendant to the Crown Court for sentence for an offence under any of sections 14 to 19 of the Act, or under one of the other provisions to which section 20 refers, and—
(i)
if that offence is an indictable offence, then the court may also commit the defendant for sentence for any other offence, or
(ii)
if that offence is a summary offence, then the court may also commit the defendant for sentence for any other offence of which the court itself has convicted the defendant and which is punishable with imprisonment or disqualification from driving, and for any suspended sentence with which the committing court could deal.
A magistrates’ court must commit a convicted defendant to the Crown Court for sentence under—
(a)
section 15 of the Sentencing Act 2020 (Committal for sentence of dangerous adult offenders) where the defendant is over 18, the offence of which the defendant has been convicted is one to which section 15 refers, and the court is of the opinion that an extended sentence of detention or imprisonment would be available in relation to the offence; or
(b)
section 17 of the 2020 Act (Committal for sentence of dangerous young offenders) where the defendant is under 18, the offence of which the defendant has been convicted is one to which section 17 refers, and the court is of the opinion that an extended sentence of detention would be available in relation to the offence.
Under sections 21 and 22 of the Sentencing Act 2020 (Power of Crown Court on committal for sentence of offender under section 14, 15 or 18; Power of Crown Court on committal for sentence of person under 18 under section 16, 16A, 17 or 19), where the defendant is committed for sentence under any of sections 14 to 19 of that Act the Crown Court may deal with the defendant in any way in which it could have done if the defendant had been convicted in that court, unless—
(a)
the defendant was committed for sentence under section 18 or 19;
(b)
the magistrates’ court did not state the opinion to which either section 18(4) or 19(3), whichever applies, refers (see also rule 9.15 (Committal for sentence for offence related to an offence sent for trial)); and
(c)
the defendant is not convicted in the Crown Court of any offence for which the magistrates’ court sent the defendant for trial,
in which event the Crown Court may deal with the defendant only in a way in which the magistrates’ court could have done.
Under section 23 of the 2020 Act (Power of Crown Court on committal for sentence under section 20), where the defendant is committed for sentence under section 20 of the Act the Crown Court may deal with the defendant only in a way in which the magistrates’ court could have done except in relation to any suspended sentence committed under that section, in respect of which the Crown Court may exercise its usual powers on dealing with such a breach.
For other powers of a magistrates’ court to commit a defendant to the Crown Court for sentence or otherwise to deal with the defendant, see—
(a)
the provisions listed in section 24 of the 2020 Act (Further powers to commit offender to the Crown Court to be dealt with); and
(b)
paragraph 11(2) of Schedule 16 to the 2020 Act, under which a magistrates’ court may commit the defendant to the Crown Court to be dealt with there if the magistrates’ court convicts the defendant of an offence during the operational period of a suspended sentence order made by the Crown Court.
The provisions listed in section 24 of the 2020 Act include section 70 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Under that section, if a magistrates’ court commits a defendant to the Crown Court so that a confiscation order can be considered then the court also may commit the defendant to the Crown Court to be dealt with there for any other offence of which the defendant has been convicted and with which the magistrates’ court otherwise could deal. Under section 71 of the 2002 Act, the Crown Court may deal with the defendant in any way in which it could have done if the defendant had been convicted in that court, unless the magistrates’ court did not make the statement to which section 70(5) refers. See also rule 24.11(10)(e), which refers to that statement.]]

Representations about obligatory disqualification or endorsement
29.1.—(1) This rule applies—
(a)
where the court—
(i)
convicts the defendant of an offence involving obligatory disqualification from driving and section 34(1) of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988(1) (Disqualification for certain offences) applies,
(ii)
convicts the defendant of an offence where section 35 of the 1988 Act(2) (Disqualification for repeated offences) applies, or
(iii)
convicts the defendant of an offence involving obligatory endorsement of the defendant’s driving record and section 44 of the 1988 Act(3) (Orders for endorsement) applies;
(b)
unless the defendant is absent.
(2) The court must explain, in terms the defendant can understand (with help, if necessary)—
(a)
where paragraph (1)(a)(i) applies (obligatory disqualification under section 34)—
(i)
that the court must order the defendant to be disqualified from driving for a minimum of 12 months (or 2 or 3 years, as the case may be, according to the offence and the defendant’s driving record), unless the court decides that there are special reasons to order disqualification for a shorter period, or not to order disqualification at all, and
(ii)
if applicable, that the period of disqualification will be reduced by at least 3 months if, by no later than 2 months before the end of the reduced period, the defendant completes an approved driving course;
(b)
where paragraph (1)(a)(ii) applies (disqualification under section 35)—
(i)
that the court must order the defendant to be disqualified from driving for a minimum of 6 months (or 1 or 2 years, as the case may be, according to the defendant’s driving record), unless, having regard to all the circumstances, the court decides to order disqualification for a shorter period, or not to order disqualification at all, and
(ii)
that circumstances of which the court cannot take account in making its decision are any that make the offence not a serious one; hardship (other than exceptional hardship); and any that during the last 3 years already have been taken into account by a court when ordering disqualification for less than the usual minimum period, or not at all, for repeated driving offences;
(c)
where paragraph (1)(a)(iii) applies (obligatory endorsement), that the court must order the endorsement of the defendant’s driving record unless the court decides that there are special reasons not to do so; and
(d)
in every case, as applicable—
(i)
that the court already has received representations from the defendant about whether any such special reasons or mitigating circumstances apply and will take account of them, or
(ii)
that the defendant may make such representations now, on oath or affirmation.
(3) Unless the court already has received such representations from the defendant, before it applies rule 24.11 (magistrates’ court procedure if the court convicts) or rule 25.16 (Crown Court procedure if the court convicts), as the case may be, the court must—
(a)
ask whether the defendant wants to make any such representations; and
(b)
if the answer to that question is ‘yes’, require the defendant to take an oath or affirm and make them.
[Note. For the circumstances in which the court—
(a)
may, and in some cases must, order disqualification from driving under the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988, see sections 26, 34, 35 and 36 of that Act(4);
(b)
may, for some reasons or in some circumstances, abbreviate or dispense with a period of disqualification otherwise required by the 1988 Act, see sections 34(1) and 35(1), (4) of that Act;
(c)

Rule 29.5 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
Appeal against recognition of foreign driving disqualification
29.6.—(1) This rule applies where—
(a)
a Minister gives a disqualification notice under section 57 of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003(17); and
(b)
the person to whom it is given wants to appeal under section 59 of the Act(18) to a magistrates’ court.
(2) That person (‘the appellant’) must serve an appeal notice on—
(a)
the court officer, at a magistrates’ court in the local justice area in which the appellant lives; and
(b)
the Minister, at the address given in the disqualification notice.
(3) The appellant must serve the appeal notice within the period for which section 59 of the 2003 Act provides.
(4) The appeal notice must—
(a)
attach a copy of the disqualification notice;
(b)
explain which of the conditions in section 56 of the 2003 Act(19) is not met, and why section 57 of the Act therefore does not apply; and
(c)
include any application to suspend the disqualification, under section 60 of the Act(20).
(5) The Minister may serve a respondent’s notice, and must do so if—
(a)
the Minister wants to make representations to the court; or
(b)
the court so directs.
(6) The Minister must—
(a)
unless the court otherwise directs, serve any such respondent’s notice not more than 10 business days after—
(i)
the appellant serves the appeal notice, or
(ii)
a direction to do so; and
(b)
in any such respondent’s notice—
(i)
identify the grounds of opposition on which the Minister relies,
(ii)
summarise any relevant facts not already included in the disqualification and appeal notices, and
(iii)
identify any other document that the Minister thinks the court will need to decide the appeal (and serve any such document with the notice).
(7) Where the court determines an appeal, the general rule is that it must do so at a hearing (which must be in public, unless the court otherwise directs).
(8) The court officer must serve on the Minister—
(a)
notice of the outcome of the appeal;
(b)
notice of any suspension of the disqualification; and
(c)
the appellant’s driving licence, if surrendered to the court officer.
[Note. Section 56 of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 sets out the conditions for recognition in the United Kingdom of a foreign driving disqualification, and provides that section 57 of the Act applies where they are met. Under section 57, the appropriate Minister may, and in some cases must, give the person concerned notice that he or she is disqualified in the UK, too, and for what period.
Under section 59 of the 2003 Act, that person may appeal to a magistrates’ court. If the court is satisfied that section 57 of the Act does not apply in that person’s case, the court must allow the appeal and notify the Minister. Otherwise, it must dismiss the appeal.
The time limit for appeal under section 59 of the 2003 Act is the end of the period of 21 days beginning with the day on which the Minister gives the notice under section 57. That period may be neither extended nor shortened.
Under section 60 of the 2003 Act, the court may suspend the disqualification, on such terms as it thinks fit.
Under section 63 of the 2003 Act(21), it is an offence for a person to whom the Minister gives a notice under section 57 not to surrender any licence that he or she holds, within the same period as for an appeal.]

[F55(2) A person applying under this rule must—
[F56(a)
apply as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the grounds for doing so, explaining—
(i)
why the order should be varied, renewed, discharged or revoked, as the case may be, by reference to the legislation under which it was made, and
(ii)
what, if any, material circumstances have changed since the court made the order or last determined an application to vary, renew, discharge or revoke it;]
[F57(b)
where the application is a second or subsequent application by the applicant in respect of the same order—
(i)
give details of each previous application, and
(ii)
if the applicant wants the court to decide the application at a hearing, explain why;]
[F58(c)]
in every case, serve the application on—
(i)
the court officer, and
(ii)
the prosecutor (unless the prosecutor is the person applying under this rule);
[F58(d)]
unless the order was a restraining order [F59or a domestic abuse protection order], serve the application on, as appropriate—
(i)
the person to whom the order was directed, and
(ii)
any other person protected or affected by the order; and
[F58(e)]
serve the application on any other person if the court so directs.]
[F60(3) A party who wants the court to take account of any particular evidence before making its decision must, as soon as practicable—

Under section 22E of the Serious Crime Act 2007(11), where a person already subject to a serious crime prevention order is charged with a serious offence or with an offence of failing to comply with the order, the court may vary the order so that it continues in effect until that prosecution concludes.
Under section 26 of the Offensive Weapons Act 2019(12), where the court has made a knife crime prevention order the court may require the applicant and the defendant to attend one or more review hearings to consider whether the order should be varied or discharged. Where a requirement or prohibition imposed by the knife crime prevention order is to have effect after the end of one year from the date the order is made, the court must convene such a review on a specified date within the last 4 weeks of that year.

inform the defendant of the supervisor’s identity and the means by which the supervisor may be contacted; and
(c)
notify the supervisor of any subsequent variation, renewal, discharge or revocation of the requirement.
[F70[Note. The legislation that gives the court power to make a behaviour order may specify circumstances in which a requirement for supervision or electronic monitoring may be imposed.
Under section 347A of the Sentencing Act 2020and under section 36 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021a sexual harm prevention order or a domestic abuse protection order, respectively, which imposes a requirement, other than an electronic monitoring requirement, on the defendant must specify the person or organisation responsible for supervising compliance with that requirement. [F71Under section 23 of the Public Order Act 2023 a serious disruption prevention order which imposes a requirement other than a notification requirement under section 24 of that Act must similarly specify a supervisor.] Before including such a requirement in an order the court must receive evidence from that supervisor about the requirement’s suitability and enforceability.
Under section 348A of the Sentencing Act 2020and under section 37 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021a sexual harm prevention order or a domestic abuse protection order, respectively, which imposes an electronic monitoring requirement on the defendant must specify the person responsible for that monitoring. If there is a person other than the defendant without whose co-operation it would be impracticable to secure that monitoring, the requirement may not be imposed without that person’s consent.]]

31.10.—(1) Where the court can impose a bind over—
(a)
the court must decide, in this sequence—
(i)
whether or not to do so and if so in what terms, and then
(ii)
the amount of the recognisance to require; and
(b)
the court may exercise its powers—
(i)
on application or on the court’s own initiative, and
(ii)
at a hearing in public, as a general rule, or, in exceptional circumstances, in private.
(2) Before imposing a bind over the court must—
(a)
take into account, as well as any representations under rule 31.2 (Behaviour orders and bind overs: general rules)—
(i)
any evidence introduced, and
(ii)
any admission made; and
(b)
satisfy itself so that it is sure that the criteria for the bind over are met.

(4) As a general rule the court must not impose a bind over for more than 12 months.
(5) If the court decides to impose a bind over—
(a)
the court must explain, in terms the person to be bound over can understand (with help if necessary)—
(i)

(iv)
the possibility of appeal; and
(b)

(a)
a breach of the peace involving violence or a threat of immediate violence has occurred; or
(b)
there is a real risk of violence in the future perpetrated by—
(i)
the person to be bound over, or

Bind over: refusal or breach
31.11.—(1) Where a person to be bound over refuses to enter into a recognisance, the court must—
(a)
consider such other steps as may be available, for example continuing or starting a prosecution; and
(b)
treat committal to custody as a last resort.
(2) Where a person bound over is alleged to have breached a requirement, before the court forfeits the recognisance it must satisfy itself on the balance of probabilities that a breach has occurred.
(3) In addition to paragraph (1) or (2), as applicable, before committing to custody or forfeiting a recognisance the court must follow the procedure required by rule 48.8 (contempt of court by obstruction, disruption, etc.; procedure on enquiry) as if—
(a)
the refusal or breach were a contempt of court; and
(b)
the committal or forfeiture were a punishment for such a contempt.
[Note. Under section 1(7) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1968 if a person whom the court decides to bind over refuses to enter into a recognisance the court can commit that person to custody.
Payment of the sum due under a recognisance that is forfeit can be enforced under section 58 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980.]]

(a)
notice of the confiscation proceedings;

(iv)
include any witness statement or other evidence on which the interested person relies.
(10) The court must—
(a)
when setting the confiscation timetable take into account any indication then available that the case will involve unusual complexity; and
(b)
review the timetable and give such further directions as may be needed if—
(i)
the defendant or the prosecutor identifies an interested person,
(ii)
other information may affect the date fixed for the confiscation hearing, or
(iii)
either party applies for further directions.
(11) The court must not determine the extent of the defendant’s interest in property in which it appears to the court that another person holds an interest unless that interested person has had a reasonable opportunity to make representations.
(12) With or without a hearing, the court may—
(a)
shorten or extend a time limit which it has set;
(b)
vary, discharge or supplement an order (other than a confiscation order) which it has made where this rule applies; and
(c)
postpone the confiscation hearing.
[Note. Under section 6 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, where a defendant is convicted of an offence the Crown Court must (with some exceptions)—
(a)
decide whether the defendant has ‘a criminal lifestyle’, within the meaning of the Act, or has benefited from particular criminal conduct;
(b)
decide the ‘recoverable amount’, within the meaning of the Act; and
(c)
make a confiscation order requiring the defendant to pay that amount.
Under section 14 of the 2002 Act, unless exceptional circumstances apply the court may postpone confiscation proceedings for a maximum of 2 years from the date of conviction, or until the end of a period of 3 months following the determination of an appeal by the defendant against conviction, if that is later.
Under section 16 of the 2002 Act, where the Crown Court is considering confiscation the prosecutor must give the court a statement of information which the prosecutor believes to be relevant to what the court must decide, within such period as the court directs. Under section 17 of the Act, where the prosecutor gives such a statement the court may order the defendant to respond and, if the defendant does not do so, then the court may treat the defendant as accepting the prosecutor’s allegations. Under section 18, for the purpose of obtaining information to help it in carrying out its functions the court may at any time order the defendant to give it information specified in the order and, if the defendant does not do so, then the court may draw such inference as it believes appropriate. Under section 18A, for the purpose of obtaining information to help it to determine the extent of the defendant’s interest in property the court may at any time order a person who the court thinks may hold an interest in that property to give it information specified in the order and, if that person does not do so, then the court may draw such inference as it believes appropriate.
Under section 27 of the 2002 Act, special provisions apply where the defendant absconds.
See also the rules in Part 3 (Case management) and Part 15 (Disclosure).
For powers to vary a confiscation order see—
(a)
rule 28.4 (Variation of sentence); and
(b)
rules 33.15 to 33.20.
Under section 97 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, the Secretary of State may by order provide for confiscation orders to be made by magistrates’ courts.]]

Rule 33.24 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
[F19Application to realise seized property or to realise or destroy cryptoassets
33.25.—(1) This rule applies where a magistrates’ court can make an order—
(a)
under section 67A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 authorising the realisation of seized personal property;
(b)
under section 67B of the 2002 Act determining any storage, insurance or realisation costs recoverable by the officer;
(c)
under section 67ZA of the 2002 Act requiring the realisation of seized cryptoassets; or
(d)
under section 67AA of the 2002 Act authorising the destruction of seized cryptoassets.
(2) An applicant for such an order must—
(a)
apply in writing; and
(b)
serve the application on—
(i)
the court officer, and
(ii)
any person whom the applicant believes would be affected by an order, including (where the application concerns cryptoassets) the UK-connected cryptoasset service provider which administers the crypto wallet in which the cryptoassets are held.
(3) The application must—
(a)
specify the property or cryptoassets concerned;
(b)
explain the applicant’s entitlement to apply and, as applicable—
(i)
how the proposed realisation of personal property meets the conditions prescribed by section 67A of the 2002 Act,
(ii)
how any storage, etc. costs have been calculated,
(iii)
how the proposed realisation of cryptoassets meets the conditions prescribed by section 67ZA of the 2002 Act, and
(iv)
how the proposed destruction of cryptoassets meets the conditions prescribed by section 67AA of the 2002 Act;
(c)
attach any material on which the applicant relies; and
(d)
propose the terms of the order, including an assessment of the market value of any cryptoassets ordered to be destroyed.
(4) The court may—
(a)
determine the application at a hearing, or without a hearing;
(b)
consider an application made orally instead of in writing; and
(c)
consider an application which has not been served on a person likely to be affected by an order.
(5) If the court authorises a realisation of personal property or a realisation or destruction of cryptoassets, the applicant must—
(a)
notify any person affected by the order who was absent when it was made; and
(b)
serve on the court officer a list of those so notified.
[Note. Under sections 67ZA and 67A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, one of the officers listed in section 41A of the Act may apply to a magistrates’ court for authority to realise personal property or cryptoassets seized by such an officer if—
(a)
a confiscation order has been made against a person who holds that property or those cryptoassets;
(b)
no receiver has been appointed in relation to that property or those cryptoassets; and
(c)
any period allowed for payment of the confiscation order has expired.
Under section 67AA of the 2002 Act, in those same circumstances an officer may apply to a magistrates’ court for authority to destroy cryptoassets if it is not reasonably practicable to realise them or there are reasonable grounds to believe that their realisation would be contrary to the public interest, having regard in particular to how likely it is that the entry of the cryptoassets into general circulation would facilitate criminal conduct by any person.
Under section 67B of the 2002 Act, if a magistrates’ court makes an order under section 67A then on the same or a subsequent occasion the court may determine an amount which may be recovered by the applicant in respect of reasonable costs incurred in storing or insuring the property, or realising it.
In the 2002 Act, for the purposes of the provisions to which this rule refers—
(a)
section 84 makes general provisions about property; and
(b)
section 84A defines ‘cryptoasset’ and related expressions.]]

[F2Notice of determination and renewal of application for permission to appeal]
42.8.—(1) [F3Paragraphs (2) and (3) of this rule apply] where a single judge or the Court of Appeal has determined an application or appeal under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Appeals under Part 2) Order 2003 or under Part 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
(2) The Registrar must, as soon as practicable, serve notice of the determination on all of the parties to the proceedings.
(3) Where a single judge or the Court of Appeal has disposed of an application for permission to appeal or an appeal under section 31 of the 2002 Act(6), the Registrar must also, as soon as practicable, serve the order on [F4the Crown Court officer and the court officer for the magistrates’ court responsible for enforcing any confiscation order which the Crown Court has made (the ‘enforcing court’)]
[F5(4) Paragraphs (5) and (6) of this rule apply where—
(a)
a single judge has refused an application for permission to appeal under section 31 of the 2002 Act, and
(b)
the appellant renews that application, in time or with an application to extend the time within which to renew.
(5) The Registrar must, as soon as practicable, notify the court officer for the enforcing court, if any, of the service of that renewed application.
(6) Unless a single judge, the Court of Appeal or the enforcing court otherwise directs, pending disposal of the renewed application the court officer for the enforcing court must withhold the payment of any sum not yet paid—
(a)
which under section 13(6) of the 2002 Act was directed to be paid out of sums recovered under a confiscation order, and
(b)
the payment of which is suspended pending appeal.
[Note. See also rule 42.11 (Notice of appeal) under which (i) the Registrar must notify the court officer for the enforcing court of the service of a notice of appeal, and (ii) that court officer must notify any person whose entitlement to payment of a sum is suspended by that appeal.
Under section 13 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, if the Crown Court makes a confiscation order and one or more priority orders, as defined in that section, against the same defendant in the same proceedings then in some circumstances the court must direct that part or all of the priority order must be paid out of sums recovered under the confiscation order.
A compensation order under section 134 of the Sentencing Act 2020 is such a priority order. Under section 141(1) of the 2020 Act, a person in whose favour a compensation order is made is not entitled to receive the amount due until there is no further possibility of the order being varied or set aside on appeal (disregarding any power to grant leave to appeal out of time). Under section 141(2) of the 2020 Act, Criminal Procedure Rules may make provision about the way in which the enforcing court is to deal with money paid in satisfaction of a compensation order where the entitlement of the person in whose favour it was made is suspended.]]

Rule 43.1 in force at 5.10.2020, see Preamble
Application for permission or reference
43.2.—(1) An appellant must—
(a)
apply orally to the Court of Appeal—
(i)
for permission to appeal or to refer a sentencing case, or
(ii)
to refer a point of law
immediately after the court gives the reasons for its decision; or
(b)
apply in writing and serve the application on the Registrar and every other party not more than—
(i)
14 days after the court gives the reasons for its decision if that decision was on a sentencing reference to which Part 41 applies (Attorney General’s reference of sentencing case), or
(ii)
28 days after the court gives those reasons in any other case.
(2) An application for permission to appeal or to refer a sentencing case must—
(a)
identify the point of law of general public importance that the appellant wants the court to certify is involved in the decision; and
(b)
give reasons why—
(i)
that point of law ought to be considered by the Supreme Court, and
(ii)
the court ought to give permission to appeal.
(3) An application to refer a point of law must give reasons why that point ought to be considered by the Supreme Court.
(4) An application must include or attach any application for the following, with reasons—
(a)
an extension of time within which to make the application for permission or for a reference;
(b)
bail pending appeal; or
(c)
permission to attend any hearing in the Supreme Court, if the appellant is in custody.
(5) A written application must be in the form [F1issued under] the Practice Direction.
[Note. In some legislation, including the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, permission to appeal is described as ‘leave to appeal’.
Under the provisions listed in the note to rule 43.1, except section 36(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 (Attorney General’s reference of point of law), an appellant needs permission to appeal or to refer a sentencing case. Under those provisions, the Court of Appeal must not give permission unless it first certifies that—
(a)
a point of law of general public importance is involved in the decision, and
(b)
it appears to the court that the point is one which the Supreme Court ought to consider.
If the Court of Appeal gives such a certificate but refuses permission, an appellant may apply for such permission to the Supreme Court.
Under section 36(3) of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 an appellant needs no such permission. The Court of Appeal may refer the point of law to the Supreme Court, or may refuse to do so.
For the power of the court or the Registrar to shorten or extend a time limit, see rule 36.3. The time limit in this rule—
(a)
for applying for permission to appeal under section 33 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (28 days) is prescribed by section 34 of that Act(18). That time limit may be extended but not shortened by the court. But it may be extended on an application by a prosecutor only after an application to which Part 27 applies (Retrial after acquittal).
(b)
for applying for permission to refer a case under section 36(5) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Attorney General’s reference of sentencing decision: 14 days) is prescribed by paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 to that Act. That time limit may be neither extended nor shortened.
(c)
for applying for permission to appeal under article 12 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (Mandatory Life Sentence: Appeals in Transitional Cases) Order 2005 (28 days) is prescribed by article 13 of that Order. That time limit may be extended but not shortened.
(d)

with an explanation for the delay, if serving it more than 21 days after that date; and

(iii)
except for rule 24.8 (Written guilty plea: special rules), the rules in [F10Part 24] then apply.

Disobedience to an explanation order, to a disclosure order or to a customer information order under the Terrorism Act 2000 is an offence: see paragraph 14 of Schedule 5, paragraph 11 of Schedule 5A and paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 6, to the Act.
Disobedience to a disclosure order or to a customer information order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 or under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Investigations) Order 2014 is an offence: see sections 359 and 366 of the Act and articles 18 and 25 of the Order. Under section 342 of the Act(31) and under article 5 of the Order, subject to the exceptions for which those provide it is an offence to make a disclosure likely to prejudice an investigation or to interfere with documents relevant to it.
If a person fails to comply with a further information order under the Terrorism Act 2000 or under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 the magistrates’ court may order that person to pay an amount not exceeding £5,000, which order may be enforced as if the sum due had been adjudged to be paid by a conviction: see section 22B(8), (9) of the Terrorism Act 2000(32) and section 339ZH((8), (9) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002(33).

consists of or includes confidential material (or, if not yet in existence, will do so), but
(ii)
does not (or will not) include items subject to legal privilege;
(d)
explain the grounds for suspecting that—
(i)
if the material is in existence, it is likely to be evidence that a relevant act has been, or is about to be, committed, or

(5) In each case the applicant must propose—
(a)
the terms of the order sought, and

[Note. See paragraphs 5 to 9 of Schedule 5 to the Terrorism Act 2000 (39) [F42and paragraphs 3 to 7 of Schedule 2 to the National Security Act 2023]. The applicant for a production, etc. order [F43under Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act] must be an ‘appropriate officer’ as defined by paragraph 5(6) of that Schedule. Where the applicant is a counter-terrorism financial investigator the application must be for the purposes of an investigation relating to ‘terrorist property’ as defined by section 14 of the 2000 Act. Under paragraphs 5 and 7 of Schedule 5 to that Act a production order may require a specified person—
(a)
to produce to an appropriate officer within a specified period for seizure and retention any material which that person has in his or her possession, custody or power and to which the application relates; to give an appropriate officer access to any such material within a specified period; and to state to the best of that person’s knowledge and belief the location of material to which the application relates if it is not in, and it will not come into, his or her possession, custody or power within the period specified; or
(b)
where such material is expected to come into existence within the period of 28 days beginning with the date of the order, to notify a named appropriate officer as soon as is reasonably practicable after any material to which the application relates comes into that person’s possession, custody or power, and then to produce that material to an appropriate officer; to give an appropriate officer access to it; and to state to the best of that person’s knowledge and belief the location of material to which the application relates if it is not in, and it will not come into, his or her possession, custody or power within that period of 28 days.
[F44The applicant for a production, etc. order under Schedule 2 to the National Security Act 2023 must be a constable investigating the commission, or anticipated commission, of a relevant act. Under paragraphs 3 and 4 of Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act a production order may impose on a specified person a requirement to produce confidential material to a constable, or to identify the location of such material, or to notify a named constable of the receipt of such material, comparably with those of a requirement imposed under the 2000 Act, described above.
Under paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act, ‘confidential material’ means—
(a)
material created or acquired for the purposes of journalism which is held in confidence or which the sender of that material to someone else intends the intended recipient to hold in confidence;
(b)
items subject to legal privilege within the meaning of section 10 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; and
(c)
excluded material and special procedure material within the meaning of sections 11 and 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, other than journalistic material.]
Under paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act, ‘legal privilege’, ‘excluded material’ and ‘special procedure material’ mean the same as under sections 10, 11 and 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
The period within which an order takes effect must be specified in the order and, unless the court otherwise directs, must be—
(a)
where the respondent already has the material, 7 days from the date of the order; or

[Note. Under paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the Terrorism Act 2000, where the conditions listed in that paragraph are fulfilled a constable may apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant authorising a search for material, other than excluded material or special procedure material, on specified premises or on any premises of a specified person. Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 to the National Security Act 2023, where the conditions listed in that paragraph are fulfilled a constable may apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant authorising a search for material, other than confidential material. Under paragraphs 11 and 12 of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act a constable may apply to a Circuit judge for such a warrant in respect of excluded or special procedure material. Under paragraph 9 of Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act, a constable may apply to a Crown Court judge for a warrant in respect of confidential material. No such warrant authorises the seizure of items subject to legal privilege.
Under paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act, ‘legal privilege’, ‘excluded material’ and ‘special procedure material’ mean the same as under sections 10, 11 and 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
Under paragraph 15 of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act, ‘confidential journalistic material’ means material which is excluded material by virtue of section 11(1)(c) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (journalistic material which a person holds in confidence and which consists of documents or records other than documents).
Under paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act, ‘confidential material’ means—
(a)
material created or acquired for the purposes of journalism which is held in confidence or which the sender of that material to someone else intends the intended recipient to hold in confidence (‘confidential journalistic material’);
(b)
items subject to legal privilege within the meaning of section 10 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; and
(c)
excluded material and special procedure material within the meaning of sections 11 and 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, other than journalistic material.
Under section 16(3) of the 1984 Act, entry and search under a warrant must be within 3 months from the date of its issue.

(a)
the person who granted the authorisation was entitled to do so;

[F110SECTION 9]: ORDERS FOR THE EXTENSION OF A MORATORIUM PERIOD UNDER THE PROCEEDS OF CRIME ACT 2002
Textual Amendments
F110
Original Pt. 47 Section 9 (rules 47.59- 47.61 and the notes to those rules) omitted and Pt. 47 Section 10 and rules 47.62-47.65 renumbered as Pt. 47 Section 9 and rules 47.59-47.62 respectively (8.2.2021) by The Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2021 (S.I. 2021/40), rules 2, 27(k)(l) (with rule 3)
When this Section applies
[F11147.59.]—(1) This Section applies where the Crown Court can extend a moratorium period under section 336A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002(122).
(2) In this Section, ‘respondent’ means, as well as a person within the meaning of rule 47.2(c), an ‘interested person’ within the meaning of section 336D of the 2002 Act(123).
[Note. Under section 336A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the Crown Court may extend a moratorium period under section 335 or section 336 of the Act(124) by up to 31 days beginning with the day after the day on which the period otherwise would end.
Under sections 335 and 336 of the 2002 Act, a moratorium period is the period of 31 days starting with the day on which consent to the doing of an act is refused by a constable, a customs officer or the Director General of the National Crime Agency. The act to which those sections refer is one that would be an offence under section 327, 328 or 329 of the 2002 Act (money laundering offences) but for the making of a disclosure within the meaning of section 338 to such an officer in relation to that act. On the expiry of the moratorium period the person who made the disclosure will be treated as having the relevant officer’s consent to the doing of the act and so will commit no offence by doing it.
The Crown Court may extend a moratorium period more than once, but the total period of extension may not exceed 186 days beginning with the day after the day on which the first 31 day period ended.
Under section 336D(3) of the 2002 Act, ‘interested person’ means the person who made the disclosure and any other person who appears to the person making an application under rule [F11247.61] to have an interest in the property that is the subject of that disclosure.]

When this Section applies
[F12047.63.]—(1) This Section applies where the Crown Court can make an overseas production order under section 1 of the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019(125).
(2) In this Section, a reference to a person affected by such an order includes a person by whom or on whose behalf there is stored any journalistic data specified or described in the application for that order.
[Note. Under section 1 of the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019, on an application by an appropriate officer (defined by section 2 of the Act) a Crown Court judge may order a person (in these rules, ‘the respondent’) to produce or give access to electronic data (by section 3, ‘data stored electronically’), other than excepted such data, where, among other criteria listed in sections 1 and 4 of the Act, the judge is satisfied that—
(a)
there are reasonable grounds for believing that—
(i)
an indictable offence has been committed and proceedings in respect of the offence have been instituted or the offence is being investigated, or
(ii)
the order is sought for the purposes of a terrorist investigation within the meaning of the Terrorism Act 2000; and
(b)
there are reasonable grounds for believing that the respondent operates in, or is based in, a country or territory outside the United Kingdom which is a party to, or which participates in, a designated international co-operation arrangement.
Section 3 of the 2019 Act defines ‘excepted electronic data’ as data stored electronically that is (a) an item subject to legal privilege, or (b) a personal record within the meaning of section 3(7) (medical, etc. records) which (i) was created in circumstances giving rise to a continuing obligation of confidence to an individual who can be identified from that record, or (ii) is held subject to a restriction on disclosure, or an obligation of secrecy, contained in an enactment. Where the respondent against whom an overseas production order is sought is a telecommunications operator, within the meaning of the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, ‘excepted electronic data’ also includes communications data within the meaning of the 2016 Act [F121unless that communications data is comprised in, included as part of, attached to or logically associated with the electronic data sought]. Where the investigation in aid of which an overseas production order is sought is a terrorist investigation other than a terrorist financing investigation within the meaning of the Terrorism Act 2000, ‘excepted electronic data’ does not include a confidential personal record.
Section 12 of the Act defines ‘journalistic data’ as electronic data that (a) was created or acquired for the purposes of journalism and (b) is stored by or on behalf of a person who created or acquired it for those purposes.]

for any other reason the application is so complex or serious as to require the court to hear the applicant.
(3) The court must not determine such an application in the absence of any respondent or other person affected unless—

(ii)
it would prejudice the investigation if the absentee were present,

(v)
the absentee has waived the opportunity to attend.
(4) The court must not determine such an application in the absence of any respondent who, if the order sought by the applicant were made, would be required to produce or give access to journalistic data, unless that respondent has waived the opportunity to attend.

(c)
postpone that enquiry (if a magistrates’ court, only until later the same day).
[Note. The conduct to which this rule applies is sometimes described as ‘criminal’ contempt of court.
By reason of sections 15 and 45 of the Senior Courts Act 1981, the Court of Appeal and the Crown Court each has an inherent power to imprison (for a maximum of 2 years), or fine (to an unlimited amount), or both, a respondent for contempt of court for the conduct listed in paragraph (1)(a), (b), (d) or (e).

By reason of sections 15 and 45 of the Senior Courts Act 1981, the Court of Appeal and the Crown Court each has an inherent power temporarily to detain a respondent, for example to restore order, when dealing with obstructive, disruptive, insulting or intimidating conduct. Under section 12(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981(15), a magistrates’ court can temporarily detain a respondent until later the same day on a contravention of that section.

make such a restraint order, or

(2) The Director must—

(c)
serve the application on the defendant and on any other person affected by the order, unless the court is satisfied that—
(i)
the application is urgent, or
(ii)
there are reasonable grounds for believing that to give notice of the application would cause the dissipation of the property which is the subject of the application.
(3) The application must—
(a)
identify the property the subject of the application;
(b)
identify the person who is or who may become the subject of such a forfeiture order;
(c)
explain how the requirements of the 2005 Order are satisfied, as the case may be—
(i)
for making a restraint order, or
(ii)
for giving effect to a forfeiture order;

specify the person or persons who are prohibited from dealing with that property,
(iii)
specify any exception to that prohibition, and
(iv)
include any ancillary order that the court believes is appropriate to ensure that the restraint order is effective; and

(ii)
give directions for notice of the order to be given to any person affected by it, and
(iii)
appoint the applicant Director as the enforcement authority.

(a)
apply in writing as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the grounds for doing so;
(b)
serve the application on the court officer and, as applicable—
(i)
the other party, and
(ii)
any other person who will or may be affected;
(c)
explain why it is appropriate, as the case may be—
(i)
for the restraint order to be varied or discharged, or
(ii)
for the registration of the forfeiture order to be cancelled;
(d)
propose the terms of any variation; and
(e)
ask for a hearing, if one is wanted, and explain why it is needed.
(7) The court may—
(a)
consider an application
(i)
at a hearing, which must be in private unless the court otherwise directs, or
(ii)
without a hearing; and
(b)
allow an application to be made orally.
[Note. Under article 19 of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas Forfeiture Orders) Order 2005, on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Director of the Serious Fraud Office the Crown Court may give effect to an order made by a court in a country outside the United Kingdom for the forfeiture and destruction, or other disposal, of any property in respect of which an offence has been committed in that country, or which was used or intended for use in connection with the commission of such an offence (described in the Order as an ‘external forfeiture order’).
Under article 5 of the 2005 Order, on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Director of the Serious Fraud Office the Crown Court may make a restraint order prohibiting any specified person from dealing with property, for the purpose of facilitating the enforcement of such a forfeiture order which has yet to be made.]

(4) The court may exercise its power to adjourn—
(a)
if either party asks, or on its own initiative; and

(ii)
in a case in which the terms of that request need to be prepared in accordance with directions by the court, giving such directions accordingly; and

as soon as practicable, serve notice of the court’s decision to extradite or discharge—

(iii)
on the Secretary of State, where Part 2 of the Act applies; and
(b)
give the court such assistance as it requires.
[Note. Part 3 contains rules about case management which apply at an extradition hearing and during preparation for that hearing. This rule must be read in conjunction with those rules.
Under section 21B of the Extradition Act 2003 (Request for temporary transfer etc.), where Part 1 of the Act applies, and in the circumstances described in that section, the parties may agree to the defendant’s temporary transfer to the requesting territory, or may agree that the defendant will speak to representatives of an investigating, prosecuting or judicial authority in that territory. On the making by a party of a request to such effect the court must if necessary adjourn the proceedings for 7 days while the other party considers it. If the parties then agree to proceed with the proposed transfer or discussion the court must adjourn the proceedings for however long seems necessary.]

SECTION 3: APPEAL TO THE HIGH COURT
[Note. Under Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003—
(a)
a defendant may appeal to the High Court against an order for extradition made by the magistrates’ court; and
(b)
the authority requesting the defendant’s extradition may appeal to the High Court against an order for the defendant’s discharge,
(see sections 26 and 28 of the Act(25)).

(see sections 103, 105, 108 and 110 of the Act(26)).
In each case the appellant needs the High Court’s permission to appeal (in the 2003 Act, described as ‘leave to appeal’).]
Exercise of the High Court’s powers
50.17.—(1) The general rule is that the High Court must exercise its powers at a hearing in public, but—

reject a notice or application and, if applicable, dismiss an application for permission to appeal, where rule 50.31 (Payment of High Court fees) applies and the party who served the notice or application fails to comply with that rule, or
(iii)
make a determination to which the parties have agreed in writing.
(2) If the High Court so directs, a party may attend a hearing by live link.
(3) The general rule is that where the High Court exercises its powers at a hearing it may do so only if the defendant attends, in person or by live link, but, despite the general rule, the court may exercise its powers in the defendant’s absence if—

the defendant waives the right to attend;
(b)
subject to any appeal to the Supreme Court, the result of the court’s order would be the discharge of the defendant; or
(c)
the defendant is represented and—
(i)
the defendant is in custody, or
(ii)
the defendant’s presence is impracticable by reason of his or her ill health or disorderly conduct.
(4) If the High Court gives permission to appeal to the High Court—
(a)
unless the court otherwise directs, the decision indicates that the appellant has permission to appeal on every ground identified by the appeal notice;
(b)
unless the court otherwise directs, the decision indicates that the court finds reasonably arguable each ground on which the appellant has permission to appeal; and
(c)
the court must give such directions as are required for the preparation and conduct of the appeal, including a direction as to whether the appeal must be heard by a single judge of the High Court or by a divisional court.
(5) If the High Court decides without a hearing an application for permission to appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court, the High Court must announce its decision at a hearing in public.
(6) The High Court may—
(a)
shorten a time limit or extend it (even after it has expired), unless that is inconsistent with other legislation;
(b)
allow or require a party to vary or supplement a notice that that party has served;
(c)
direct that a notice or application be served on any person; and
(d)
allow a notice or application to be in a different form to one [F22issued under] the Practice Direction, or to be presented orally.
(7) A party who wants an extension of time within which to serve a notice or make an application must—
(a)
apply for that extension of time when serving that notice or making that application; and
(b)
give the reasons for the application for an extension of time.

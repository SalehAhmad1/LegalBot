(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 1 of the Superannuation Act 1972 (“the Act”) permits the Minister for the Civil Service to make schemes which make provision for pension and other benefits in respect of civil servants and persons serving in an office or employment listed in Schedule 1 to the Act. The Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme, the Civil Service Additional Voluntary Contribution Scheme, the Civil Service Compensation Scheme and the Civil Service Injury Benefit Scheme are some of the schemes that have been made under section 1 of the Act.
The addition of an employment or office to Schedule 1 to the Act makes a person serving in that employment or holding that office eligible to be a member of schemes made under section 1 of the Act, subject to the rules of those schemes.
Article 2 of this Order provides that, from the specified dates, section 1 of the Act applies to employment by the Office of the Small Business Commissioner, employment by the Money and Pensions Service, and employment by the Student Loans Company Limited.
Article 3 of this Order provides that, from the specified date, section 1 of the Act applies to the office of the Small Business Commissioner and the office of the Deputy Small Business Commissioner.
Article 4 of this Order provides that, from the specified dates, section 1 of the Act applies to certain employments and offices remunerated out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund. These employments and offices are employment by the Independent Living Fund Scotland and the office of Commissioner of the Scottish Law Commission (excluding any Commissioner who holds high judicial office).
Article 5 of this Order provides that, from the specified date, section 1 of the Act applies to employment by the National Academy for Educational Leadership, which is remunerated out of the Welsh Consolidated Fund. The addition of employments and offices remunerated out of the Welsh Consolidated Fund is authorised by section 1(7) of the Act.
Article 6 of this Order removes employment by the Pensions Advisory Service Limited from Schedule 1 to the Act, as the Pensions Advisory Service Limited has been superseded by the Money and Pensions Service, which has been added to Schedule 1 by Article 2 of this Order. The offices of the Ministerial Adviser on Gender-based Violence, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence and the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales are moved from the list of “Other Bodies” to the list of “Offices” in Schedule 1 to the Act to correct an error in S.I. 2017/1261.
A number of changes to Schedule 1 to the Act made by this Order have effect from dates before the date this Order is made. This is authorised by section 1(8)(a) of the Act.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact upon the costs of business or the voluntary sector is foreseen.

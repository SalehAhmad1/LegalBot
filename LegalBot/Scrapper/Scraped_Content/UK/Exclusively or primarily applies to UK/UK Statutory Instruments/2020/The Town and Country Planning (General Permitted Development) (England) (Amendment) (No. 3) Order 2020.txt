20th July 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/596).
Article 4(2) inserts into Part 20 of Schedule 2 to the 2015 Order a new permitted development right. Class ZA allows for the demolition of a single detached building in existence on 12 March 2020 that was used for office, research and development or industrial processes, or a free-standing purpose-built block of flats, and its replacement by an individual detached block of flats or a single detached dwellinghouse within the footprint of the old building. The old building should have a footprint no larger than 1,000 square metres and be no higher than 18 metres. The old building must have been built before 1990 and have been vacant for at least six months before the date of the application for prior approval. The right provides permission for works for the construction of a new building that can be up to two storeys higher than the old building with a maximum overall height of 18 metres. In particular there is an essential prior approval process.
Otherwise the Order covers incidental and consequential matters.
An assessment of impact is being published alongside this instrument at www.legislation.gov.uk . An Explanatory Memorandum is also published alongside this instrument at that address. A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is being produced by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and will also be published at www.legislation.gov.uk and copies may be inspected at the Planning Directorate, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, 2 Marsham Street London, SW1P 4DF.

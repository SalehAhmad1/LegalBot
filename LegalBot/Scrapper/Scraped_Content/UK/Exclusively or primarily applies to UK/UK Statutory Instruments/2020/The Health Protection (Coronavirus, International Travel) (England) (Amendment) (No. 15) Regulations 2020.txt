(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) (“the principal Regulations”) to—
(a)
remove Curaçao, Denmark, Iceland and Slovakia from the list of exempt countries and territories, in Schedule A1 to the principal Regulations, from which passengers arriving in England are not required to self-isolate;
(b)
amend Schedule 2 to the principal Regulations to:
(i)
create a new exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for people undertaking activities necessary for the participation of the organisation they represent in the 4th National Lottery Licence Competition,
(ii)
create a new exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for elite sportspersons travelling to the United Kingdom for medical examinations and people accompanying them in order to provide necessary care and support,
(iii)
expand the exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for people engaged in film and high end TV production so that it also applies to certain advertising production professionals, and
(iv)
amend the exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for elite sportspersons so that it applies to domestic elite sportspersons who have been to non-exempt countries or territories for the purposes of training and multinational ancillary sportspersons;
(c)
amend the list of specified competitions in Schedule 3 to the principal Regulations, which is relevant to the exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for elite sportspersons.

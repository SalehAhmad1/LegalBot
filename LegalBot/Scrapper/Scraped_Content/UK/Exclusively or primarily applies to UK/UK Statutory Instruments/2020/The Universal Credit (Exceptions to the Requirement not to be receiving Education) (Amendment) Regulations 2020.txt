3rd August 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376) (“the UC Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends regulation 14 of the UC Regulations, which sets out the exceptions to the requirement to meet the basic condition not to be receiving education. Regulation 14(1)(b) is amended to clarify that a person entitled to attendance allowance, disability living allowance or personal independence payment will only be entitled to universal credit if they have been determined to have limited capability for work and that determination was made on or before the date of claim to universal credit, where the person is already receiving education on the date the claim is made, or before the date that the person starts receiving education, where the person starts receiving education after the date of claim to universal credit.
Provision is also made to read the reference to “date of claim” in regulation 14(1)(b) of the UC Regulations as a reference to “date of award” where a couple separates and an award is made without a claim to each of them as a single person and one of those persons is receiving education. The same applies where one member of a couple dies and the surviving member is receiving education.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

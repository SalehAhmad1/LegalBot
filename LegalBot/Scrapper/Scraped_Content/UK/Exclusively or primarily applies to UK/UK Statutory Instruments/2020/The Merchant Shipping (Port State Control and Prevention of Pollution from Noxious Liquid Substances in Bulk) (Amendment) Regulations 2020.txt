At 11.26 a.m. on 11th May 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Merchant Shipping (Port State Control) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/2601) (“the 2011 Regulations”) to the effect that the powers in the 2011 Regulations may be exercised in relation to ships to which the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (“SOLAS”) applies.
These Regulations also amend the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution from Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/68) (“the 2018 Regulations”) to the effect that the 2018 Regulations apply to ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk in “controlled waters” (waters within which the jurisdiction and rights of the United Kingdom are exercisable in accordance with Part XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and the discharge by ships of noxious liquid substances in bulk causing pollution in those waters.
Regulation 2(1) of the 2011 Regulations includes in the definition of “Conventions” the international instruments in respect of which the 2011 Regulations apply. Regulation 3 of the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/940) amended regulation 2(1) of the 2011 Regulations but this was defective because the amendment had the effect of removing SOLAS from the scope of the 2011 Regulations. These Regulations therefore amend the 2011 Regulations to bring SOLAS back within their scope.
Regulation 5 of the 2018 Regulations makes provision about their territorial application. Regulation 5 provided, amongst other things, that regulation 24 (control of discharges of noxious liquid substances from ships) applies to discharges of noxious liquid substances in bulk from ships causing pollution in United Kingdom waters and regulation 26 (prohibition on the carriage and discharge of unassessed liquid substances) applies to ships, carrying unassessed liquid substances in breach of this regulation, causing pollution in United Kingdom waters.
Regulation 5 was defective because it does not reflect the position agreed in international law and extend the territorial application of regulations 24 and 26 to occurrences causing pollution in controlled waters. These Regulations therefore amend the 2018 Regulations to extend their application to ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk in “controlled waters” and to the discharge by ships of noxious liquid substances in bulk causing pollution in those waters.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

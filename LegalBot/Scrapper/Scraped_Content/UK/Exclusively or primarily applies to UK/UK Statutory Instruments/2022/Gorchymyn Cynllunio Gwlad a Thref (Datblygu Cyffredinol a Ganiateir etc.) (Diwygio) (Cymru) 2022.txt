(2) The local planning authority need not serve notice on an owner or occupier in accordance with sub-paragraph (1)(c), if they consider that—
(a)
individual service on that owner or occupier is impracticable because it is difficult to identify or locate that person, or

the number of owners or occupiers within the area to which the direction relates makes individual service impracticable, but this is subject to sub-paragraph (3).
(3) Sub-paragraph (2) does not apply where the owner or occupier is a statutory undertaker or the Crown.

(a)

specify the date on which it is proposed that the direction will take effect, which must be at least 28 days but no longer than 2 years after the date specified under paragraph (e).
(5) Where a notice given by site display is, without any fault or intention of the local planning authority, removed, obscured, or defaced before the end of the period specified under sub-paragraph (4)(e), the authority is treated as having complied with that sub-paragraph if they have taken reasonable steps for the protection of the notice, including, if need be, its replacement.
(6) The local planning authority must send a copy of the direction and the notice under sub-paragraph (1), and a copy of a map defining the area or site to which it relates, to the Welsh Ministers on the same day that notice of the direction is first published or displayed in accordance with sub-paragraph (1).

26 Medi 2022NODYN ESBONIADOL
(Nid yw’r nodyn hwn yn rhan o’r Gorchymyn)
Mae’r Gorchymyn hwn yn diwygio Gorchymyn Cynllunio Gwlad a Thref (Datblygu Cyffredinol a Ganiateir) 1995 (O.S. 1995/418) (“Gorchymyn 1995”). Mae erthygl 3 o Orchymyn 1995, ac Atodlen 2 iddo, yn rhoi hawliau datblygu a ganiateir mewn cysylltiad â datblygu penodol. Pan roddir hawliau o’r fath, nid yw’n ofynnol gwneud cais am ganiatâd cynllunio.
Mae erthygl 4 o Orchymyn 1995 yn caniatáu i awdurdodau cynllunio lleol a Gweinidogion Cymru gyfarwyddo na fydd unrhyw ddatblygu a ganiateir, na datblygu penodol a ganiateir, o dan erthygl 3 o Orchymyn 1995 yn gymwys mewn perthynas ag ardal a bennir. Mae erthygl 2(2) o’r Gorchymyn hwn yn diwygio erthygl 4 o Orchymyn 1995.
Mae erthyglau 2(2)(b) a (d) yn hepgor erthyglau 4(2) a (5).
Mae erthygl 2(2)(e) yn mewnosod paragraff (5A) sy’n cyflwyno Atodlen newydd 2A. Mae Atodlen 2A yn amlinellu gweithdrefnau newydd y mae rhaid eu dilyn wrth wneud, amrywio neu dynnu’n ôl unrhyw gyfarwyddyd a wneir o dan erthygl 4(1). Mae Atodlen 2A hefyd yn cyflwyno dau fath o gyfarwyddyd: cyfarwyddyd a gaiff effaith ar unwaith a chyfarwyddyd na chaiff effaith ar unwaith.
Mae erthygl 2(3) yn hepgor erthyglau 5 a 6 o Orchymyn 1995.
Mae erthygl 2(5) yn diwygio Rhan 3 (newid defnydd) o Atodlen 2 i Orchymyn 1995 drwy fewnosod dau ddosbarth newydd, sef Dosbarth I a Dosbarth J.
Mae Dosbarth I yn cyflwyno nifer o hawliau datblygu a ganiateir newydd ar gyfer achosion diderfyn o newid defnydd, gan gynnwys defnydd cymysg, rhwng Dosbarth Defnydd C3 (Tai Annedd, a ddefnyddir fel unig breswylfeydd neu brif breswylfeydd); Dosbarth Defnydd C5 (Tai Annedd, a ddefnyddir heblaw am fel unig breswylfeydd neu brif breswylfeydd) a Dosbarth Defnydd C6 (Llety byrdymor). Mae’r datblygu a ganiateir yn ddarostyngedig i gyfyngiadau.
Mae Dosbarth J yn cyflwyno nifer o hawliau datblygu a ganiateir newydd o ddefnydd fel swyddfa fetio i ddefnydd o fewn Dosbarth A1 (siopau); neu Ddosbarth A2 (gwasanaethau ariannol a phroffesiynol); neu ddefnydd cymysg fel naill ai Ddosbarth A1 neu Ddosbarth A2, yn ogystal â fflat unigol. Mae Dosbarth J hefyd yn caniatáu newid defnydd o ddefnydd cymysg fel swyddfa fetio a fflat unigol i ddefnydd o fewn Dosbarth A1 neu Ddosbarth A2, neu ddefnydd cymysg fel naill ai Ddosbarth A1 neu Ddosbarth A2, yn ogystal â fflat unigol, ac i ddefnydd fel swyddfa fetio. Mae’r datblygu a ganiateir yn ddarostyngedig i gyfyngiadau.
Mae erthygl 3(2) yn diwygio Rheoliadau Cynllunio Gwlad a Thref (Digolledu) (Cymru) (Rhif 2) 2014 (O.S. 2014/2693 (Cy. 268)) (“Rheoliadau 2014”) drwy ychwanegu dosbarth datblygu newydd at y rhestr o hawliau datblygu a ganiateir y mae digolledu yn sgil tynnu’r hawl yn ôl yn gyfyngedig ar ei gyfer mewn ffyrdd amrywiol yn Rheoliadau 2014. Mae’r hawliau newydd yn Nosbarth I yn caniatáu newid defnydd amrywiol, fel y’i mewnosodwyd yn Rhan 3 o Atodlen 2 i Orchymyn 1995 gan erthygl 2(5) o’r Gorchymyn hwn.
Effaith ymarferol Rheoliadau 2014 yw, pan gaiff hawliau datblygu a ganiateir a nodir yn rheoliad 2 eu tynnu’n ôl drwy ddyroddi cyfarwyddyd o dan erthygl 4 o Orchymyn 1995, nad yw digolledu yn daladwy ond mewn perthynas â cheisiadau a wnaed o fewn 12 mis yn dechrau ar y dyddiad y cafodd y cyfarwyddyd effaith.
Mae’r materion a ragnodir yn rheoliadau 3 a 4 o Reoliadau 2014 yn ymwneud â chaniatâd cynllunio a roddir gan orchymyn datblygu ac yn darparu mecanwaith i’r hawliau datblygu a ganiateir a nodir yn rheoliad 2 gael eu tynnu’n ôl heb fod digolledu yn daladwy, cyhyd â bod y gweithdrefnau rhagnodedig yn cael eu dilyn o ran y dull tynnu’n ôl, y dull o gyhoeddi’r tynnu’n ôl a’r cyfnod hiraf o hysbysiad y caniateir ei roi mewn perthynas â’r tynnu’n ôl. Mae rheoliad 5 yn gwneud darpariaeth debyg o ran tynnu’n ôl hawliau datblygu a ganiateir a roddir gan orchymyn datblygu lleol.
Mae erthyglau 3(3) a (4) yn gwneud mân ddiwygiadau canlyniadol i Reoliadau 2014.
Ystyriwyd Cod Ymarfer Gweinidogion Cymru ar gynnal Asesiadau Effaith Rheoleiddiol mewn perthynas â’r Gorchymyn hwn. O ganlyniad, lluniwyd asesiad effaith rheoleiddiol mewn perthynas â’r Gorchymyn hwn.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Glasgow and Birkhall, Royal 
Deeside, by reason of an intended helicopter flight. These Regulations apply except insofar as 
flying is already prohibited by the Air Navigation (Restriction of Flying) (Birkhall) (Restricted 
Zone EG R705) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1320). 
The Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that it is in the public 
interest to restrict flying in the vicinity of the relevant areas to avoid the risk that transient aircraft 
may disrupt the helicopter flight. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Sumer Time (BST). 
Full details of this statutory instrument will be promulgated by Briefing Sheet and Notice to 
Aviation (NOTAM).

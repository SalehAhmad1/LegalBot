20th April 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Emissions Performance Standard Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”) (S.I. 2015/933) to update certain definitions that apply in respect of the monitoring and enforcement of the emissions performance standard in England.
Certain terms defined in the 2015 Regulations require amending to refer to the relevant legislation that is currently in force. These terms are only used in Part 3 of the 2015 Regulations.
Regulation 2 of this instrument therefore provides for the amendment of regulation 2 of the 2015 Regulations. This inserts a new definition of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020, and amends the definitions of “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Permit”, “Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report”, “the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation”, “the Verification Regulation” and “verified”.

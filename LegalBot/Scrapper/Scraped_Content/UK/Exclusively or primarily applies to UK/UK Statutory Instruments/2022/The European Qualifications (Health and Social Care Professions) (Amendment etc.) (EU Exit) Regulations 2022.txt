26th January 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in part in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (c), (d) and (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations are made in order to correct errors in the European Qualifications (Health and Social Care Professions) (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/593) (“the Healthcare Qualifications Regulations 2019”) and to amend the National Health Service (Performers List) (England) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/335) (the ‘Performers List Regulations’).
Regulation 2 makes amendments to the General Medical Council (Form and Content of the Registers) Regulations 2015 to remove defunct references to European medical practitioners which were not removed due to an error in the Healthcare Qualifications Regulations 2019.
Regulations 3 removes provisions relating to UK alerts that were held on the European Union’s Internal Market Information System database from the Healthcare Qualifications Regulations 2019 as the UK no longer has access to the database as of IP Completion day and all UK alerts have been removed from the database.
Regulation 4 amends the Performers List Regulations to exempt applicants holding EU qualifications from undertaking the foundation training required as part of registration on the Dental Performers List.

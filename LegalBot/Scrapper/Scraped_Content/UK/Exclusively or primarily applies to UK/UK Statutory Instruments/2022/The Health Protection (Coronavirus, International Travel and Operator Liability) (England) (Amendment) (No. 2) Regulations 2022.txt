At 10.18 a.m. on 10th February 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend, primarily, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/582) (“the International Travel Regulations”).
In particular, regulations 3 to 35:
amend regulation 3 and Schedule 6 of the International Travel Regulations to extend the period during which arrivals can provide passenger information on the Passenger Locator Form to up to three days before they are required to provide the information, and to update the information they need to provide;
amend regulation 3A of the International Travel Regulations to add and remove entries from the lists dealing with the countries and territories from whom we accept vaccine certificates, including those certificates that are equivalent to the European Union Digital COVID Certificate;
omit regulations 3I, 3J and 3K of the International Travel Regulations to remove testing and self-isolation obligations on eligible travellers;
amend regulations 5, 6 and 7 and Schedule 8 of the International Travel Regulations to secure that:
arrivals from places other than category 3 countries or territories need only take a day 2 test, and
those subject to workforce testing other than recurring work travellers or an arrival from a category 3 countries or territories need only take a day 2 workforce test;
omit regulation 8 of the International Travel Regulations to remove the specific testing regime for offshore installation workers;
amend regulation 9 of the International Travel Regulations to secure that arrivals from places other than category 3 countries or territories do not need to self-isolate on arrival in England;
amend regulations 13 and 14 of the International Travel Regulations to provide that an operator of a relevant service need only provide specified information to passengers pre-departure and on-board the relevant service. Schedule 12 is amended to update the information that must be provided to passengers;
insert regulation 15A into the International Travel Regulations to impose a new duty on operators to implement and maintain adequate systems and processes to ensure that passengers that arrive in England on a relevant service they operate possess certain information or evidence. This “systems duty” replaces the range of specific obligations on operators under regulations 16 to 18, which are omitted;
amend regulation 20 of the International Travel Regulations to secure that a new fixed penalty notice can be issued in respect of an ongoing breach of the systems duty where a previous fixed penalty notice issued in respect of the breach has been paid;
substitute Schedule 4 to the International Travel Regulations to update the categories of arrival who enjoy exemption from certain obligations under the International Travel Regulations – extensive consequential amendment to the International Travel Regulations is made in light of this substitution;
make further minor and consequential amendment to the International Travel Regulations, including to correct errors.
Regulation 36 amends the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/659) (“the Notification Regulations”) in consequence of the amendments to the International Travel Regulations.

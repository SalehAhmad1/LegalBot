25th January 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) and amend the Afghanistan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/948) (“the 2020 Regulations”).
This amendment facilitates humanitarian assistance and other activities that support basic human needs in Afghanistan, by creating a further exception to prohibitions in the 2020 Regulations which implement the asset-freeze imposed on persons designated by the UN as associated with the Taliban in constituting a threat to the peace, stability and security of Afghanistan. It reflects the modifications to the United Kingdom’s obligations under United Nations Security Council resolution 2255 (2015), adopted on 21 December 2015, which are made by Security Council resolution 2615 (2021), adopted on 22 December 2021.
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An impact assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and can be found at: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653271/Sanctions_and_Anti-Money_Laundering_Bill_Impact_Assessment_18102017.pdf.

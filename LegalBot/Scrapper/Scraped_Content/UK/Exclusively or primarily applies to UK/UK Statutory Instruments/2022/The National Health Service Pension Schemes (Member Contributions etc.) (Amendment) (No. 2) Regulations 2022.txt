(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service Pension Schemes (Member Contributions etc.) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/273) (“the Member Contributions Regulations”) and the National Health Service Pension Scheme (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/95) (“the Transitional Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the Member Contributions Regulations to update the pensionable earnings bands that determine a member’s contribution rate for the 2022/23 scheme year.
Regulation 3 amends paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to the Transitional Regulations, which sets out the circumstances when pensioner members of the scheme set out in the National Health Service Pension Scheme Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/653) (“the 2008 Section”) become eligible to join the scheme set out in the National Health Service Pension Scheme Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/94). The amendment corrects an omission in the National Health Service Pension Schemes (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/327) by adding a further group of 2008 Section pensioner members who return to NHS employment following retirement from the 2008 Section on ill-health grounds. Regulation 3 has retrospective effect from 1st April 2022, which is the date on which S.I. 2022/327 came into force. Section 3(3)(b) of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25) provides that scheme regulations may make retrospective provision.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

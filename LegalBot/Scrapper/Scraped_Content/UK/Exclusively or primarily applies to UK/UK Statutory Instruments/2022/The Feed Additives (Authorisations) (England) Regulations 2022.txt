(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations authorise the placing on the market of eleven feed additives in England.
Regulation 3 and Schedules 1 to 11 contain the following authorisations: —
Schedule 1 authorises a new feed additive Manganese chelate of lysine and glutamic acid (identification number 3b509);
Schedule 2 authorises a new feed additive Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 29026) (identification number 1k20759);
Schedule 3 authorises a new feed additive Serine protease (EC 3.4.21.-) produced by Bacillus licheniformis (DSM 19670) (identification number 4a13);
Schedule 4 renews the authorisation of Pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) (identification number 3a831);
Schedule 5 renews the authorisation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CNCM I-4407) (identification number 4b1702);
Schedule 6 renews the authorisation (with modification) of Bacillus velezensis (ATCC PTA-6737) (identification number 4b1823) and authorises it for a new use to be used in feed for all minor poultry (except for laying) and ornamental, sporting and game birds;
Schedule 7 authorises a new feed additive Bacillus licheniformis (DSM 28710) (identification number 4b1828);
Schedule 8 renews the authorisation of Clostridium butyricum (FERM BP-2789) (identification number 4b1830), authorises it for a new use to be used in feed, suckling piglets and minor porcine species (suckling) and as a new feed additive for chickens for fattening;
Schedule 9; authorises a new feed additive 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Komagataella phaffii DSM 32854 (identification number 4a32);
Schedule 10 authorises a new formulation of Deccox® (identification number E756) as Decoquinate (Deccox®) (identification number 51756i) following a re-evaluation requested by the holder;
Schedule 11 authorises a modification of Deccox® (identification number E756) as Decoquinate (Avi-Deccox® 60G) (identification number 51756ii) This feed additive differs from Decoquinate (Deccox®) in its physical form and in the carrier used being calcium sulphate dihydrate.
Authorisations granted by these Regulations are valid for a period of ten years in accordance with Article 9(7) of Regulation (EC) 1831/2003. This is subject to Article 14(4) of that Regulation, which provides for an extension of the authorisation period in certain circumstances where an application for renewal has been submitted.
Regulations 4 to 7 amend four retained EU Regulations that authorise the feed additive Bacillus subtilis ATCC PTA-6737 for differing poultry and pig sub-groups. The bacterial strain name is amended from “Bacillus subtilis” to “Bacillus velezensis”.
Regulation 8 is a transitional provision which allows products labelled using the name “Bacillus subtilis” in Regulations 4 to 7 to continue to be marketed and used under the relevant authorisations despite the name change. It also enables the continued production and labelling of products, for limited periods under the previous authorisation that is now authorised by Schedule 6.
Regulations 9 and 10 contain transitional provisions that enable the continued production and labelling of products, for limited periods, under the conditions of previous authorisations where authorisations are renewed under Schedules 5 and 10 respectively.
Regulation 11 and Schedule 12 revoke, in relation to England, retained EU Regulations that contain previous authorisations for the feed additives now authorised by Schedules 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 11.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

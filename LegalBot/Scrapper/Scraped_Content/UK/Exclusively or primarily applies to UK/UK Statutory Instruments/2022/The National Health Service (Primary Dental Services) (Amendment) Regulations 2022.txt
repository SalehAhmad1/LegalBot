(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the National Health Service (General Dental Services Contracts) Regulations 2005 (S.I 2005/3361) (“the GDS Contracts Regulations”) and the National Health Service (Personal Dental Services Agreements) Regulations 2005 (S.I 2005/3373) (“the PDS Agreements Regulations”).
Each course of treatment provided under General Dental Services Contracts and Personal Dental Services Agreements is attributed a set number of units of dental activity under those Contracts or Agreements. Regulations 2 and 4 amend the GDS Contracts Regulations and PDS Agreements Regulations, respectively, to sub-divide the units of dental activity under a band 2 course of treatment into 3 sub-categories, each with a different amount of units of dental activity attributed to it.
Regulations 3 and 5 insert provision into the GDS Contracts Regulations and the PDS Agreements Regulations requiring dental contractors to provide comprehensive and accurate dental profiles to NHS England for publication on the NHS.uk website, and to review and update those profiles.

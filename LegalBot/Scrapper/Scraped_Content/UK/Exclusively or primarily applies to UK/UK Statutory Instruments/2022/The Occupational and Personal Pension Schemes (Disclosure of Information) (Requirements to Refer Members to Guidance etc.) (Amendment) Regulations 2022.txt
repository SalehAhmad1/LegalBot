12th January 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/2734) (“the 2013 Regulations”) and in so doing consequentially modifies the effect of related provisions of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (c. 48) (“the Act”) as follows.
Paragraph (2) corrects, by updating, the definition of “pensions guidance” in the 2013 Regulations.
Paragraph (6) inserts new regulations 18C to 18E into the 2013 Regulations.
New regulation 18C sets out the procedures which the trustees or managers of an occupational pension scheme must follow to ensure that a “relevant beneficiary” (“B”) has received “appropriate pensions guidance” (both terms as defined in paragraph (10) of that new regulation) and the conditions that must be satisfied after they receive an application, or a communication made in relation to an application, from B on or after 1st June 2022 to transfer rights to flexible benefits accrued under the scheme or to start receiving flexible benefits provided by the scheme. New regulation 18C(3) sets out the circumstances in which these requirements do not apply to applications for a transfer of rights to flexible benefits (as defined in regulation 2 of the 2013 Regulations). New regulation 18C also sets out the circumstances in which B may opt out of receiving appropriate pensions guidance.
New regulation 18D makes consequential modifications to the effect of sections 99 and 101J respectively of the Act. These modifications modify the effect of the requirements imposed on trustees or managers of occupational pension schemes that provide money purchase benefits to carry out a qualifying member or their survivor’s request to transfer their pension benefits within six months of the date of their application or giving of a transfer notice. The effect of these modifications is to disapply those requirements where the trustees or managers are unable to proceed with an application under section 95(1), or a transfer notice under section 101G4, of the Act within that six-month period because the requirements set out in regulations made under section 113B of the Act relating to the receipt of appropriate pensions guidance, or the opting out of receiving such guidance, have not been satisfied (see further above in relation to regulation 18C made under section 113B of the Act).
New regulation 18E sets out the related record-keeping requirements of the trustees or managers.
Paragraphs (3) to (5) make consequential amendments to the 2013 Regulations. Paragraph (3) amends regulation 4(7) so that the requirement in that regulation (for trustees or managers to provide a postal and electronic address for any request for further information or other enquiry from a member) does not apply where information is given verbally by trustees or managers in accordance with new regulation 18C(4) or (7). Paragraphs (4) and (5) consequentially amend regulations 18A and 18B, respectively, to disapply the requirements in those regulations to provide information on pensions guidance where new regulation 18C applies.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector has been undertaken. A copy is annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum which is available alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk. Copies have been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament and may also be obtained from the Better Regulation Unit of the Department for Work and Pensions, Caxton House, Tothill Street, London SW1H 9NA.

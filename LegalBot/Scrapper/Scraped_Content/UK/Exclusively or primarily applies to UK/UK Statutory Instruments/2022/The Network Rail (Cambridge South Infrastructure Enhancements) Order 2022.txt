(4) In any action against Network Rail in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a highway under this article, it is a defence (without affecting any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that Network Rail had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the highway to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(5) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (4), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the highway and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a highway of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the highway;

whether Network Rail knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the highway to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the highway; and
(e)
where Network Rail could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the highway before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that Network Rail had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the highway to which the action relates unless it is also proved that Network Rail had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the highway and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.Access to works

form and lay out means of access, or improve existing means of access, in the locations specified in columns (1) and (2) of Schedule 9 (access to works); and

make provision for the street authority to carry out any function under this Order which relates to the street in question; and
(b)
contain such terms as to payment and otherwise as the parties consider appropriate.Discharge of water
16.—(1) Network Rail may use any watercourse or any public sewer or drain for the drainage of water in connection with the construction or maintenance of the authorised works and for that purpose may lay down, take up and alter pipes and may, on any land within the Order limits, make openings into, and connections with, the watercourse, public sewer or drain.
(2) Any dispute arising from the exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph (1) to connect to or use a public sewer or drain is to be determined as if it were a dispute under section 106 (right to communicate with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991(1).

17.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this article, Network Rail may at its own expense carry out such protective works to any building lying within the Order limits as Network Rail considers to be necessary or expedient.
(2) Protective works may be carried out—
(a)
at any time before or during the construction in the vicinity of a building of any part of the authorised works; or
(b)
after the completion of the construction of that part of the authorised works in the vicinity of a building at any time up to the end of the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which that part of the authorised works is first opened for use.
(3) For the purpose of determining how the functions under this article are to be exercised Network Rail may (subject to paragraph (5)) enter and survey any building falling within paragraph (1) and any land within its curtilage.
(4) For the purpose of carrying out protective works under this article to a building Network Rail may (subject to paragraphs (5) and (6))—
(a)
enter the building and any land within its curtilage; and
(b)
where the works cannot be carried out reasonably conveniently without entering land which is adjacent to a building but outside its curtilage, enter the adjacent land (but not any building erected on it).
(5) Before exercising—
(a)
a right under paragraph (1) to carry out protective works to a building;
(b)
a right under paragraph (3) to enter a building and land within its curtilage;
(c)
a right under paragraph (4)(a) to enter a building and land within its curtilage; or
(d)
a right under paragraph (4)(b) to enter land,
Network Rail must, except in the case of emergency, serve on the owners and occupiers of the building or land not less than 14 days’ notice of its intention to exercise that right and, in a case falling within sub-paragraph (a) or (c), specifying the protective works proposed to be carried out.
(6) Where a notice is served under paragraph (5)(a), (5)(c) or (5)(d), the owner or occupier of the building or land concerned may, by serving a counter-notice within the period of 10 days beginning with the day on which the notice was served, require the question whether it is necessary or expedient to carry out the protective works or to enter the building to be referred to arbitration under article 44 (arbitration).
(7) Network Rail must compensate the owners and occupiers of any building or land in relation to which the powers conferred by this article have been exercised for any loss or damage arising to them by reason of the exercise of those powers.

(a)
protective works are carried out under this article to a building; and
(b)
within the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which the part of the authorised works constructed in the vicinity of the building is first opened for use it appears that the protective works are inadequate to protect the building against damage caused by the construction or operation of that part of the authorised works,
Network Rail must compensate the owners and occupiers of the building for any loss or damage sustained by them.
(9) Without affecting article 43 (no double recovery) nothing in this article relieves Network Rail from any liability to pay compensation under section 10(2)(1) (further provision as to compensation for injurious affection) of the 1965 Act.
(10) Any compensation payable under paragraph (7) or (8) is to be determined, in case of dispute, as if it were a dispute under Part 1 of the 1961 Act.

(a)
underpinning, strengthening and any other works the purpose of which is to prevent damage which may be caused to the building by the construction, maintenance or operation of the authorised works;
(b)
any works the purpose of which is to remedy any damage which has been caused to the building by the construction, maintenance or operation of the authorised works; and
(c)
any works the purpose of which is to secure the safe operation of the authorised works or to prevent or minimise the risk of such operation being disrupted.

SCHEDULE 10
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply with the necessary modifications as respects compensation in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph (1), the 1961 Act has effect subject to the following modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 10 to the Network Rail (Cambridge South Infrastructure Enhancements) Order 2022 (“the 2022 Order”);
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 10 to the 2022 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken” substitute “a right over land is purchased”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 20 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 19 (power to acquire land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of rights under article 22(1) or 22(2) (power to acquire new rights)—
(a)
with the modification specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in the case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land)—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 20(1)), it has power, exercisable in the equivalent circumstances and subject to the equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 20(7)) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over the whole or part of a house, building or factory.
(2) But see article 23 (power to acquire subsoil or airspace only) of the Network Rail (Cambridge South Infrastructure Enhancements) Order 2022, which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of its decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the proposed use of the right to be acquired, and
(c)
if the right is proposed to be acquired for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

for the area of the authorised works, and in relation to any apparatus, means the undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained.
Acquisition of apparatus
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the deposited plans, Network Rail must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Alternative apparatus
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, Network Rail acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of an undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in question.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Network Rail requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the undertaker in question and Network Rail within 21 days of the service of a notice under sub-paragraph (2), or in default of such agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 44 (arbitration).
(4) In any case where alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed under sub-paragraph (2), or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus, Network Rail must, subject to sub-paragraph (5), afford to the undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of Network Rail and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(5) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of Network Rail, or Network Rail is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (4), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Network Rail, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(6) The undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 44, and after the grant to the undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (4) or (5), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by Network Rail to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(7) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (6), if Network Rail gives notice in writing to the undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of Network Rail, that work, instead of being executed by the undertaker, must be executed by Network Rail without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker.
(8) Nothing in sub-paragraph (7) authorises Network Rail to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail affords to an undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of Network Rail of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Network Rail and the undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 44 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of Network Rail, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Network Rail in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Network Rail to that undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Existing apparatus: protection and access
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2), Network Rail must submit to the undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and an officer of the undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by an undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If an undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by Network Rail, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to Network Rail of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Network Rail from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) Network Rail is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must repay to an undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any of the authorised works.
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule (other than apparatus that is re-used as alternative apparatus) is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions except where this has been solely due to using the nearest currently available type; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 44 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an undertaker in respect of works under sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

44.—(1) This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between Network Rail and Cadent are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act, except for—
(a)
paragraphs 45, 50, 50(10) and 52; and
(b)
where sub-paragraph (2) applies, paragraphs 48 and 49.
(2) This sub-paragraph applies where any apparatus is diverted from an alignment within the existing adopted public highway but not wholly replaced within the existing public highway, notwithstanding that any diversion may be carried out under the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
45.  Notwithstanding the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under the powers of article 11 (temporary stopping up of streets), Cadent will be at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as it would have been entitled to do immediately before such temporary stopping up or diversion in respect of any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that highway.
46.  Network Rail must exercise the powers conferred by article 17 (protective works to buildings) so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of Cadent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
47.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, Network Rail may not appropriate or acquire any interest in land or appropriate, acquire, extinguish or override any easement or other interest in land of Cadent otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out or maintenance of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between Cadent and Network Rail) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of Cadent or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Cadent and Network Rail in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by Network Rail, Network Rail must as Cadent reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Cadent and Network Rail acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent unless otherwise agreed by Cadent, and it will be the responsibility of Network Rail to procure or secure the consent to and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works or maintenance thereof.
(3) Network Rail and Cadent agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus, including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by Cadent and other enactments relied upon by Cadent as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Part of this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by Cadent under paragraph 50 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) As a condition of an agreement under sub-paragraph (1) that involves de-commissioned apparatus being left in situ Network Rail must accept a surrender of any existing easement or other interest of Cadent in such decommissioned apparatus and release Cadent from all liabilities in respect of such de-commissioned apparatus from the date of such surrender.
(6) Where Network Rail acquires land which is subject to any Cadent right or interest (including, without limitation, easements and agreements relating to rights or other interests) and the provisions of paragraph 48 do not apply, Network Rail must, unless Cadent agrees otherwise—
(a)
retain any notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering Network Rail’s title to such acquired land; and
(b)
(where no such notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register) include (with its application to register title to Network Rail’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry) a notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land.
48.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, including pursuant to any agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 47, Network Rail acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of Cadent to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and the facilities and rights referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the satisfaction of Cadent and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Network Rail requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Cadent advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Cadent reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) Network Rail must afford to Cadent to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 49(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If Network Rail is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph 49(2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent may, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Network Rail, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist Network Rail in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for Cadent to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and Network Rail.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by Network Rail to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
49.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the construction, maintenance and access to of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Network Rail and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Network Rail and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 56 of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Network Rail to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
50.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works (or such lesser period as is agreed by Cadent in writing) Network Rail must submit to Cadent a plan and, if reasonably required by Cadent, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc.;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) Network Rail must not commence any specified works until Cadent has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of Cadent given under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (5); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and Cadent must meaningfully engage with the undertaker within 56 days of the date of submission of the plan under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plan as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Specified works must only be executed in accordance with—
(a)
the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between Network Rail and Cadent; and
(b)
all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and Cadent will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by Network Rail (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If Cadent, in consequence of the works proposed by Network Rail, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs (1) to (3) and (6) to (8) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 48(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Network Rail from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order the undertaker must comply with the Cadent’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “Specification for safe working in the vicinity of Cadent High pressure Gas pipelines and associated installation requirements for third parties SPGD/SP /SSW22” and HSE’s “HS(~G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
(11) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised works (including such an event attributable to its maintenance)—
(a)
Network Rail must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme; and
(b)
Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 50(10).
(12) Network Rail is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and sub-paragraph (10) at all times.
(13) In this paragraph, “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to, or to prevent the occurrence of, circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works believes on reasonable grounds to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.
51.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must pay to Cadent on demand, all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or reasonably incurred by Cadent in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by Cadent in connection with the necessary acquisition of rights or the necessary exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including professional fees) incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 48(3) if it elects to do so; or
(ii)
exercising any necessary compulsory purchase powers under this Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any necessary diversion work or the provision of any necessary alternative apparatus;
(c)
the necessary cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of necessary protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule;
(g)
any watching brief pursuant to sub-paragraph 50(6).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 56 to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible or appropriate in the circumstances (or it would be unlawful due to a statutory or regulatory change) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by Network Rail.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
52.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works (including works carried out under article 17 (protective works to buildings)) by or on behalf of Network Rail or in consequence of any act or default of Network Rail (or any person employed or authorised by Network Rail) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal or decommissioning for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, Network Rail will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from Cadent, the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Cadent becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of Network Rail or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse Network Rail from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on Network Rail in respect of any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) Cadent must give Network Rail reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting Network Rail and considering their representations.
(5) If Network Rail has transferred the benefit of the Order to another undertaking pursuant to Article 31 of the Order no person or body who is not a licensed operator under the Railway Act 1993 must commence construction (or permit the commencement of such construction) of the authorised works on any land owned by Cadent or in respect of which Cadent has an easement or wayleave for its apparatus or any other interest or to carry out any works within 15 metres in any direction of Cadent’s apparatus unless and until Cadent is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to Cadent that it shall maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and Cadent has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker.
53.  Except where this Part of this Schedule provides otherwise, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and Cadent in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Network Rail on the date on which this Order is made.
54.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised works, Network Rail or Cadent requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 48(2) or Cadent makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 50, Network Rail must use its reasonable endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised works and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Cadent’s undertaking and Cadent must use its best endeavours to co-operate with Network Rail for that purpose.
(2) Whenever Cadent’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by Cadent or the taking of action by Cadent, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
55.  If in consequence of any agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 47(1) or the powers conferred by this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, Network Rail must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable Cadent to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
56.  Save for differences or disputes arising under sub-paragraphs 48(2), 48(4), 49(1), 52(5) and paragraph 50 any difference or dispute arising between Network Rail and Cadent under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between Network Rail and Cadent, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 44 (Arbitration).
57.  Notwithstanding article 41 (Service of Notices) any plans submitted to Cadent by Network Rail pursuant to paragraph 50(1) must be sent via email to plantprotection@cadentgas.com copied by e-mail to vicky.cashman@cadentgas.com and sent to the General Counsel Department at Cadent’s registered office or such other address as Cadent may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to Network Rail in writing.

Acquisition of apparatus
79.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the deposited plans, Network Rail must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Alternative apparatus
80.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, Network Rail acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of SSW to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of SSW.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Network Rail requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to SSW written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed
(3) The proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed is subject to approval by SSW (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event that SSW (acting reasonably) considers the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be unsuitable, SSW shall (acting reasonably) propose an alternative position for the alternative apparatus and must give Network Rail written notice of such alternative position for the alternative apparatus within 28 days of the service of a notice under sub-paragraph (2). Any dispute regarding the alternative apparatus (including but not limited to the proposed position and/or the alternative proposed position) which cannot be agreed between the parties is to be determined in accordance with article 44 (arbitration).
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between SSW and Network Rail such agreement to be within 28 days of the service of a notice under sub-paragraph (2) (or within 28 days of service of a notice under sub-paragraph (3) where SSW has proposed an alternative position for the alternative apparatus under sub-paragraph (3) which is acceptable to Network Rail), or in default of such agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 44 (arbitration).
(5) In any case where alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed under sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order SSW reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus, Network Rail must, subject to sub-paragraph (6), afford to SSW the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of Network Rail and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus and SSW shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs incurred in securing such necessary facilities and rights from Network Rail subject to paragraph 83(3) below.
(6) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of Network Rail, or Network Rail is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (5), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, SSW must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Network Rail, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours (having regard to its statutory powers) to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(7) SSW must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 44, and after the grant to SSW of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (6) or (6), proceed without unreasonable delay (having regard to the operational requirements of SSW) to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus.
(8) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (7), if Network Rail gives notice in writing to SSW that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of Network Rail, that work, instead of being executed by SSW, must be executed by Network Rail without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of SSW.
(9) Nothing in sub-paragraph (8) authorises Network Rail to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 3 metres of the apparatus without the written consent of SSW (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or denied).
(10) In relation to any works which will or may be situated on, over or within 3 metres measured in any direction of any apparatus, the plan to be submitted to SSW under sub-paragraph (1) must be detailed, include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which they are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation and positioning of plant;
(d)
the position of all apparatus including existing apparatus and apparatus to be retained;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to such apparatus; and
(f)
any maintenance required.
81.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail affords to SSW facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of Network Rail of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Network Rail and SSW or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 44 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of Network Rail, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed within 3 metres of any existing apparatus of SSW, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of SSW for ensuring the protection of the existing apparatus and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with the existing apparatus; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the existing apparatus for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(4) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Network Rail in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to SSW than the facilities and rights enjoyed by SSW in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Network Rail to SSW as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Existing apparatus: protection and access
82.—(1) Not less than 42 days before starting the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Network Rail under paragraph 80(2), Network Rail must submit to SSW a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by SSW for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and an officer of SSW is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by SSW under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 28 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If SSW in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by Network Rail, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to Network Rail of that requirement, paragraphs 75 to 81 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by Network Rail under paragraph 80(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Network Rail from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 42 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) Network Rail is not required to comply with sub-paragraph 82(1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to SSW notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses
83.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must repay to SSW the reasonable expenses incurred by SSW in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any of the authorised works.
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule (other than apparatus that is re-used by SSW acting reasonably as alternative apparatus) is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions except where this has been solely due to using the nearest currently available type; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 44 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the type, capacity, dimensions, or at the existing depth required to maintain the existing operational requirement, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to SSW by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess (save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances (or it would be unlawful due to a statutory or regulatory change) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth).
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to SSW in respect of works under sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on SSW any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Any dispute as to whether a financial benefit is conferred in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or as to the amount of such financial benefit which cannot be agreed is to be determined in accordance with article 44 (arbitration).
Damage to apparatus: costs, losses, etc.
84.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the authorised works any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of SSW or there is any interruption in any service provided or in the supply of any goods, by SSW Network Rail must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by SSW in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to SSW for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by SSW, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on Network Rail with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of SSW, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) SSW must give Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of Network Rail (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and in the event of any dispute to be settled by arbitration in accordance with article 44 (arbitration).
Enactments and agreements
85.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and SSW in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Network Rail on the date on which this Order is made.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations designate certain schemes and bodies under the Energy Prices Act 2022 (c. 44) (“the Act”).
Regulation 2 designates a domestic electricity price reduction scheme for Great Britain for the purposes of section 2 of the Act. Regulation 3 designates a domestic gas price reduction scheme for Great Britain for the purposes of section 3 of the Act.
Domestic electricity or gas price reduction schemes reduce the amount charged for domestic electricity or gas supply by licensed suppliers, and make payments to those suppliers in respect of those reductions. The effect of designation is to impose obligations on suppliers to apply to join the scheme and, when joined, to remain in and comply with it, and for regulatory enforcement.
Copies of the Scheme Documents designated by regulations 2 and 3 are available from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0ET.
Regulation 4 designates certain district councils for the purposes of section 15 of the Act (role of other bodies in giving support for meeting energy costs etc).
An impact assessment was produced for the Energy Prices Bill and is available from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0ET. A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

This Order also removes the restrictions stated in articles 3 and 4 of the Power to Award Degrees etc. (Blackpool and The Fylde College) Order of Council 2016 so that Blackpool and The Fylde College may now authorise other institutions to grant awards on its behalf and so that Blackpool and The Fylde College may grant awards to persons who were not enrolled at the institution at the time they completed the course of study for which the award is granted. This Order authorises Blackpool and The Fylde College to grant awards up to and including bachelor’s degree awards for a three-year and three-month fixed term expiring 12th December 2025. This Order will come into force on 13th September 2022.

(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 81(1) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (“the Act”) provides that it shall not be lawful for a person to drive a motor vehicle on a restricted road at a speed exceeding 30 miles per hour. Subject to the provisions of sections 82 and 84(3) of the Act, a road is a restricted road for the purposes of section 81 of the Act if, in England and Wales, there is provided on it a system of street lighting furnished by means of lamps placed not more than 200 yards apart. Section 81(2) of the Act enables the national authority (being the Welsh Ministers in relation to Wales pursuant to section 142(1) of the Act) by order to increase or reduce the rate of speed fixed by section 81(1), either as originally enacted or as varied under that subsection. Section 81(3)(aa) of the Act provides that such an order, if made by the Welsh Ministers, is to be made by statutory instrument and approved by a resolution of Senedd Cymru. Before the Welsh Ministers make an order under section 81(2) of the Act, they are required by section 81(5) of the Act to consult with the Secretary of State.
This Order is made by the Welsh Ministers under section 81(2) of the Act. It reduces the general speed limit for restricted roads from 30 miles per hour to 20 miles per hour in relation to Wales.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order.

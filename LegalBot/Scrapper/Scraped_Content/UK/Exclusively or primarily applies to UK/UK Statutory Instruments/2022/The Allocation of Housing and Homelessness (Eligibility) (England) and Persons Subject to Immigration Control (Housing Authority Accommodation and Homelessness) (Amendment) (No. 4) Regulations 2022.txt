(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/1294) (“the 2006 Regulations”) and the Persons subject to Immigration Control (Housing Authority Accommodation and Homelessness) Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/706) (“the 2000 Order”).
Confirmed victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery (“CVHTS”) who meet the criteria are currently granted discretionary leave outside of the Immigration Rules making them eligible for an allocation of housing and homelessness assistance in England under regulations 3(b) and 5(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations. Article 3 of the 2000 Order grants eligibility for housing authority accommodation for CVHTS in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, whilst article 7 provides eligibility to this cohort for homelessness accommodation and assistance in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
From 30 January 2023, CVHTS will be granted limited leave to remain where they meet the criteria set out under Appendix Temporary Permission to Stay for Victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery of the Immigration Rules (“the Appendix”). These Regulations are made to ensure the continued eligibility of CVHTS for an allocation of housing and homelessness assistance and housing authority accommodation.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the 2006 Regulations by adding persons in receipt of limited leave to remain granted under the Appendix as an eligible class for an allocation of housing and homelessness assistance in England.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends Articles 3 and 7 of the 2000 order, by adding persons in receipt of limited leave to remain granted under the Appendix as an eligible class for housing authority accommodation in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland and homelessness accommodation and assistance in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

At 1.40 p.m. on 7th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/214) (“the 2022 Regulations”) contained an error in regulation 1(1) in that they did not include a commencement date. These Regulations substitute a commencement date of 28th March 2022 into those Regulations.
The 2022 Regulations amended the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985 (S.I. 1985/967). In a report (published as Command Paper Cm 8860 on 8th May 2014(1)), the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council recommended that Dupuytren’s contracture, arising from work for ten years or more in aggregate which involves the use of hand-held powered tools, be prescribed as a disease. Regulation 3 of the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Amendment Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1241) introduced the prescription for Dupuytren’s contracture.
The 2022 Regulations amended the prescription for Dupuytren’s contracture and provided further specification on the circumstances in which Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is payable. The reason for amending the prescription was to bring the Regulations into line with the most up to date guidance from the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council.
Hard copies of the report may be obtained from the Department for Work and Pensions, IIDB Policy, Disability and Housing Support Directorate, Caxton House, Tothill Street, London SW1H 9NA.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

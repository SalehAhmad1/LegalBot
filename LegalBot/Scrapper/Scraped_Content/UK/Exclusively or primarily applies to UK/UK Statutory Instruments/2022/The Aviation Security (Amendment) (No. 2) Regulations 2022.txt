(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of aviation security.
Regulation 2 amends Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 (aviation security) (“the Retained Regulation”). In particular, the amendments remove requirements for the screening of passengers, staff and cabin baggage, as well as provisions which cross-refer to these requirements. Paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) of Regulation 2 insert definitions of LAGs, STEB and LEDS into the Retained Regulation in appropriate positions.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Immigration (Passenger Transit Visa) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/2702) which requires certain passengers to hold a transit visa to pass through the United Kingdom without entering whilst transiting to another country.
Schedule 1 to that Order sets out a list of countries or territories whose nationals or citizens need transit visas, and this Order adds El Salvador to that list.
Article 3 contains a transitional provision to disapply the requirement for a transit visa to people who at the time this Order comes into force had already booked travel to the United Kingdom to arrive before 9th June 2022.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

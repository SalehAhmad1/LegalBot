“How to calculate country-specific multiplier
8A.—(1) The country-specific multiplier for a country is the multiplier specified in the table in relation to its band.
(2) The band for a country is the band specified in the table in relation to its price level index value.
Price level index value (x) Band Multiplier
x<0.3 A 0.2
0.3≤ x<0.5 B 0.4
0.5≤ x<0.7 C 0.6
0.7≤ x<0.9 D 0.8
0.9≤ x<1.1 E 1.0
1.1≤ x<1.3 F 1.2
x≥1.3 G 1.4
(3) The price level index value for a country is the quotient of—
(a)
the price level value for the country in the most recent year available, and
(b)
the price level value for the United Kingdom in the same year.
Example
0.736687 is the country’s price level value and 1.058064 is the United Kingdom’s price level value.
0.736687 divided by 1.058064 is 0.696259…‬ (unrounded).
The price level index value for the country is 0.696259…, which is Band C.
The country-specific multiplier for a country in Band C is 0.6.
(4) If the price level value for a country is not published, the Authority may determine the price level value for that country by reference to a comparable country.
(5) In this regulation, “price level value” means the value published by the World Bank in its “Price level ratio of PPP conversion factor (GDP) to market exchange rate” world development indicator(1).
How to calculate repayment threshold variable

(a)
one, and
(b)
the percentage increase, expressed as a decimal, in the retail price index between the two Marches immediately before the commencement of the previous repayment threshold year(2).
Example
2.4% is the percentage increase in the retail price index.
2.4% expressed as a decimal is 0.024.
The sum of 1 and 0.024 is 1.024.
The repayment threshold variable is 1.024.

8C.—(1) An example used in these Regulations—
(a)

Minister for Education and Welsh Language, one of the Welsh MinistersEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Student Loan) (Repayment) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/470) (“the 2009 Regulations”) and revoke spent enactments.
The amendment of the 2009 Regulations:
reorganises student loans within the scope of the 2009 Regulations into five plans, including a new plan 5 loan for certain courses beginning on or after 1st August 2023;
for borrowers who have a plan 2 loan (formerly a “post-2012 student loan”):
maintains the income-based repayment threshold (above which a borrower who has reached the statutory repayment due date in regulation 15 is required to make repayments) at £27,295 until the end of 5th April 2025, and
changes the annual uprating of the repayment threshold thereafter from a calculation based on differences in average earnings to one based on the retail price index;
introduces fixed instalment rates, which:
are used to calculate repayments by overseas borrowers who have not provided required information about their income,
replace the fixed instalments set out in regulation 76 (which is omitted), and
for repayments of a plan 2 loan, a plan 3 loan (formerly a “postgraduate degree loan”) or a plan 5 loan, are recalculated annually based on the median salary for graduates;
consolidates the provisions reducing interest rates on plan 2 and 3 loans applied by S.I. 2021/677, 1005, 1378, 2022/889 and 1151 (which are revoked);
omits spent provisions;
makes incidental, supplemental or technical amendments.
The student loans within the scope of the 2009 Regulations are:
loans under section 22 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 (c. 30),
loans under section 73(f) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 (c. 44) in respect of which the Scottish Ministers have determined that repayments are to be collected by His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, and
loans subject to transfer arrangements under the Sale of Student Loans Act 2008 (c. 10).
Part 1 of the 2009 Regulations (general) is amended as follows:
regulation 3 (interpretation) is amended to revise the definitions of expressions used in the 2009 Regulations;
new regulations 3A to 3E set out the five student loan plans within the scope of the 2009 Regulations;
regulation 4 (application: general) is amended to set out what is required to be repaid in relation to a student loan;

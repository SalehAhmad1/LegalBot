(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Prison and Young Offender Institution (Coronavirus) (Amendment) (No. 2) Rules 2020 (S.I. 2020/508) (“the 2020 Rules”). Rules 2 and 3 amend Schedules 1 and 2 of the 2020 Rules to change the definition of “transition period” from the period of three months to be a period starting at the end of a transmission control period and finishing with 24th March 2022.
Rules 2 and 3 also remove the mechanism for Independent Adjudicators to refer cases back to prison governors where the coronavirus pandemic had prevented cases being heard in person. A new system has now been introduced that allows for adjudications to be heard online by Independent Adjudicators.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to retained EU law and domestic regulations relating to the import of aquatic animals.
The amendments in Part 1 remove the lists of susceptible and vector species from retained EU law and provide powers to publish those lists administratively. The amendments also remove the species and zonal elements from Annex 3 to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 and provide the power to publish those elements administratively.
The amendments in Part 2 remove the susceptible species and vector species lists in domestic regulations and replace these with a power to publish the lists administratively.
A full impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

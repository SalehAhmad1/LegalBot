(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Public Regulated Service (Galileo) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/230) which implemented Decision No 1104/2011/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on the rules for access to the public regulated service provided by the global navigation satellite system established under the Galileo programme (OJ L 287, 4.11.2011, p.1) as it has effect in EU law.
The revocation addresses failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a) and (g) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

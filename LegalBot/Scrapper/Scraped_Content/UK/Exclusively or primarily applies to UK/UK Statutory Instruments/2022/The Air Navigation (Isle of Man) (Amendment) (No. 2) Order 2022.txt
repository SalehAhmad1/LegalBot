Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Air Navigation (Isle of Man) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/870) (“the 2015 Order”) makes provision for the Isle of Man in relation to the registration, marking, airworthiness, equipment, manning, operation, movement and safety of aircraft and the licensing and welfare of flight crew.
The Airports and Civil Aviation Act 1987 (AT 10 of 1987) (an Act of Tynwald), as amended by the Airports and Civil Aviation (Amendment) Act 2018 (AT 12 of 2018) (an Act of Tynwald), provides enabling powers so that the Isle of Man is able to make its own secondary legislation in relation to civil aviation.
The 2015 Order is amended by the Air Navigation (Isle of Man) (Amendment) Order 2022 (S.I. 2022/172) which revokes provision on the registration and marking of aircraft, certain aircraft operations, aircraft classification and aerodromes.
These revocations will have effect from the date when replacement provisions made by the Isle of Man come into force. These can be found in the Civil Aviation (Aircraft Registration and Marking) Order 2022 (SD No 2022/0073), the Civil Aviation (Aerodromes) Order 2022 (SD No 2022/0074) and the Civil Aviation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2022 (SD No 2022/0075).
The present Order makes amendments to S.I. 2022/172 before it comes into effect, to ensure that (a) all necessary consequential amendments are made to the 2015 Order following the revocations already set out in S.I. 2022/172, (b) the interpretation provisions of the 2015 Order are updated and amended where necessary following the introduction of the definition of a “single-seat deregulated aeroplane”, (c) the transitional and savings provision is sufficiently clear, and (d) cross references to the replacement Isle of Man legislation are updated.

”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/829 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and of the Council on protective measures against pests of plants, authorising Member States to provide for temporary derogations in view of official testing, scientific or educational purposes, trials, varietal selections, or breeding.
The Regulations amend the requirements for record keeping, allow multiple introductions into and movements of material within Great Britain to take place under one letter of authority (subject to endorsement by the competent authority of the territory of Great Britain from which the material is to be moved, where appropriate), amend the information required in an application for an authorisation and replace the model Letter of Authority with an updated version (regulation 2).
The Regulations make transitional provision so that regulation 2(3)(a) applies to introductions or movements made after the commencement of the Regulations under letters of authority issued before 1st November 2022.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

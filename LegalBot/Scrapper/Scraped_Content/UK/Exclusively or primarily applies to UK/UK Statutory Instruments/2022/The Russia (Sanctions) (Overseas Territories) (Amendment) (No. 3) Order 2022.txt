(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes amendments to the Russia (Sanctions) (Overseas Territories) Order 2020 (S.I. 2020/1571) (“the Principal Order”).
The Principal Order extends with modifications the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the Russia sanctions regulations”) as amended from time to time to all British overseas territories except Bermuda and Gibraltar (which implement sanctions under their own legislative arrangements). The Russia sanctions regulations established a sanctions regime in relation to Russia for the purpose of encouraging Russia to cease actions destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.
The Russia sanctions regulations have been recently amended by the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 11) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/792), the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 12) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/801), the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 13) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/814) and the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 14) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/850) (“the amending regulations”).
This Order makes the necessary amendments to the Principal Order to give effect in the relevant British overseas territories to the changes made to the Russia sanctions regime by the amending regulations.
An Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this Order: the territorial extent of both this Order and the Principal Order is the British overseas territories listed in the Schedule to this Order and no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sector in the United Kingdom.

11th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1976 (“the 1976 Regulations”) and the Statutory Sick Pay (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1985 (“the 1985 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(2), (3) and (4) amends the 1976 Regulations by removing the requirement for a doctor’s statement to be completed in ink or indelible substance and for it to be signed by the doctor providing the statement. In place of the requirement for a doctor’s statement to be signed by the doctor, regulation 2(4)(c) requires that the name of the doctor, whether in the form of a signature or otherwise, be contained within the statement. Regulation 2(2) and (3) also amend the 1976 Regulations to permit the statement to be in the form provided for in Part 2 or Part 2A. Regulation 2(5) inserts a new Part 2A which contains an additional version of the doctor’s statement.
Regulation 3(2) removes part of the definition of “signature”, which is rendered superfluous by these Regulations. Regulation 3(3), (4) and (5) amends the 1985 Regulations by removing the requirement for a doctor’s statement to be completed in ink or indelible substance and for it to be signed by the doctor providing the statement. In place of the requirement for a doctor’s statement to be signed by the doctor, regulation 3(5)(c) requires that the name of the doctor, whether in the form of a signature or otherwise, be contained within the statement. Regulation 3(3) and (4) also amend the 1985 Regulations to permit the statement to be in the form provided for in Part 2 or Part 2A. Regulation 3(6) inserts a new Part 2A which contains an additional version of the doctor’s statement.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

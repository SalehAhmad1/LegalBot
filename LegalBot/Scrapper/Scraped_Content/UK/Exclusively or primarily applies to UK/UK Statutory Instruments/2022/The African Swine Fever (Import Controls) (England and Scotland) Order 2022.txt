1981 (c. 22) (“the 1981 Act”). Section 10 was amended by S.I. 1990/2371 and 1993/1813. Functions conferred under the 1981 Act on “the Ministers” (as defined in section 86 of that Act) are now exercisable by the Secretary of State in relation to England and the Scottish Ministers in relation to Scotland. In relation to England they were transferred, so far as exercisable by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by S.I. 1999/3141 and were then further transferred to the Secretary of State by S.I. 2002/794. In relation to Scotland, functions were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46). Despite this transfer, the Secretary of State retains power to exercise certain functions under section 10 of the 1981 Act in relation to Scotland by virtue of S.I. 1999/1592.Citation, commencement, extent and application

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Official Controls (Extension of Transitional Periods) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/809), to change the end date of “the transitional staging period” (defined in Annex 6 to Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (EUR 2017/625)) from 30th June 2022 to 31st December 2022 (regulation 4).
Regulation 2 amends Regulation (EU) 2017/625 to enable regulation-making powers in Articles 53 and 54 of that Regulation to be exercised during the transitional staging period. It also makes provision for the “appropriate frequency rate” (defined in Annex 6 to Regulation (EU) 2017/625) for certain plants and plant products to be set by reference to regulations made using those powers.
The Regulations also amend the Meat Preparations (Amendment and Transitory Modification) (England) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1666) to extend the temporary suspension of the requirement for meat preparations to be deep-frozen where they are imported into England from EEA member States, the Faroe Islands, Greenland or Switzerland, bringing it into line with the extended duration of the transitional staging period (regulation 3).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

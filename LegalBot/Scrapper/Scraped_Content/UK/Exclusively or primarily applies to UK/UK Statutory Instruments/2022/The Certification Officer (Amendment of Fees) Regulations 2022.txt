8th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which come into force on 1st April 2022, prescribe the fees payable to the Certification Officer in respect of her functions in relation to trade unions and employers’ associations. The amendments also reflect the revocation of certain fees, including all those previously set out in the Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations (Amalgamations, etc) Regulations 1975, where the related costs incurred by the Certification Officer are intended to be subsumed by the levy payable to the Certification Officer under the Trade Union (Levy Payable to the Certification Officer) Regulations 2022 (“the Levy Regulations”), also coming into force on 1st April 2022. The fees are varied or set as follows—
the fee payable on application for approval of a proposed instrument of amalgamation or transfer (formerly £1850) is revoked as the related costs are intended to be subsumed by the levy payable to the Certification Officer in accordance with the Levy Regulations (regulation 4);
the fee payable on an application for approval of a change of name (formerly £96) is revoked as the related costs are intended to be subsumed by the levy payable to the Certification Officer in accordance with the Levy Regulations (regulation 4);
the fee for an inspection of documents kept by the Certification Officer in respect of amalgamations or transfers of engagements (formerly £19) is revoked as the related costs are intended to be subsumed by the levy payable to the Certification Officer in accordance with the Levy Regulations (regulation 4);
the fee for the entry of the name of an amalgamated organisation in the lists maintained by the Certification Officer where the name of each of the amalgamating organisations is already so entered (formerly £41) is revoked as the related costs are intended to be subsumed by the levy payable to the Certification Officer in accordance with the Levy Regulations (regulation 4);
the fee on application by an organisation of workers to have its name entered in the list of trade unions maintained by the Certification Officer is increased from £150 to £519 (regulation 5);
the fee on application by an organisation of employers to have its name entered in the list of employers’ associations maintained by the Certification Officer is increased from £150 to £519 (regulation 6);
the fee payable on an application by a trade union for a certificate of independence is reduced from £4066 to £997 (regulation 7);
the fee payable by an amalgamated trade union for the issue of a certificate of independence where each amalgamating union had such a certificate (formerly £41) is revoked as the related costs are intended to be subsumed by the levy payable to the Certification Officer in accordance with the Levy Regulations. This is an effect of the revocation of the Certification Officer (Amendment of Fees) Regulations 2005, which provided for the former fee at regulation 8 (regulation 8).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision on regulated food product authorisations in relation to Wales. Part 2 and the Schedules are made pursuant to retained (EU) Regulation 2015/2283 on novel foods. Part 3 is made pursuant to retained Regulation (EC) No. 2065/2003 on smoke flavourings used or intended for use in or on foods.
Part 2 and the Schedules update, in relation to Wales, the list of authorised novel foods in Annex 1 to retained Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 establishing the Union list of novel foods—
Schedule 1 amends the existing entry for 2’-Fucosyllactose/Difucosyllactose (2’FL/DFL) to authorise the placing on the market of that novel food for use in milk-based drinks and similar products intended for young children;
Schedule 2 inserts a new entry, authorising the placing on the market of a specific strain of Schizochytrium sp. Oil (FCC-3204) as a novel food for use in food supplements, and for infant formula and follow-on formula;
Schedule 3 inserts a new entry, authorising the placing on the market of a specific strain of Schizochytrium sp. Oil (WZU477) as a novel food for use in infant formula and follow-on formula;
Schedule 4 inserts a new entry, authorising the placing on the market of 3’-Sialyllactose (3’-SL) sodium salt (microbial source) as a novel food for use in the specified food categories;
Schedule 5 inserts a new entry, authorising the placing on the market of 6’-Sialyllactose (6’-SL) sodium salt (microbial source) as a novel food for use in the specified food categories.
Part 3 contains modifications to the authorisations for five smoke flavouring primary products within the Annex to retained Regulation (EC) No. 1321/2013 establishing the Union list of authorised smoke flavouring primary products for use as such in or on foods. The amendments change the names and the addresses of the authorisation holders of the respective product authorisations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

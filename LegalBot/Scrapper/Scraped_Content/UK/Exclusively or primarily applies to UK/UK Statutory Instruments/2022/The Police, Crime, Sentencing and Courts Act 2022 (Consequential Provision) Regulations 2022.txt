(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision that is consequential on section 185 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (2022 c. 32). Section 185 inserts new section 43C into the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11), which confers a power to stop and search terrorist offenders released on licence. The new power will apply where an offender’s licence includes a search condition and the constable is satisfied that the search is necessary for purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism.
Section 47AA of the 2000 Act imposes a requirement on the Secretary of State to prepare a code of practice containing guidance about the exercise of search powers that are conferred by that Act. The effect of regulation 2 is that the obligation will also apply to the new power.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

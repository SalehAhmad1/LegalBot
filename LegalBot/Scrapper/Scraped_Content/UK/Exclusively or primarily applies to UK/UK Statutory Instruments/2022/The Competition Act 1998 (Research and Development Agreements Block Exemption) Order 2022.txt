The Competition and Markets Authority has recommended that the Secretary of State make an order specifying certain categories of agreements relating to research and development for the purposes of section 6 of the Competition Act 1998(1) (“the Act”).
In accordance with section 8 of the Act(2), before making the recommendation the Competition and Markets Authority published details of the proposed recommendation and considered the representations about it which were made to it(3).
The Secretary of State has decided to give effect to the recommendation without modifications.
The Secretary of State has also decided to vary two retained block exemption regulations under section 10A(1) of the Act(4). Before coming to that decision, the Secretary of State has—
(a)
in accordance with section 10A(2) of the Act, had regard to the conditions specified in section 9(1) for exemption from the prohibition in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the Act, and
(b)
in accordance with section 10A(5) of the Act, informed the Competition and Markets Authority of the proposed variations and taken into account that Authority’s comments.
The Secretary of State therefore makes the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 6(2)(a), (5), (6) and (7), 10A(1) and 71(3) of the Act.

1998 c. 41. Section 6 was amended by paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 (c. 24) to give the function of making recommendations to the Competition and Markets Authority. The Competition and Markets Authority was established by section 25 of that Act. This function was previously the responsibility of the Director General for Fair Trading and then the Office of Fair Trading. Other amendments to section 6 were made by paragraph 38 of Schedule 25 to the Enterprise Act 2002 (c. 40) and S.I. 2004/1261. “Research and development” is defined in article 2(1) of this Order.

Department for Business, Energy and Industrial StrategyEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is a block exemption Order under section 6 of the Competition Act 1998 (c. 41) (“the Act”). It gives effect to the Competition and Markets Authority’s (“CMA”) recommendation that certain R&D agreements (as defined in article 3(2) of the Order) constitute a category of agreements which are likely to be exempt agreements as a result of section 9 of the Act. Agreements which fall within the category specified in article 3 of the Order are exempt from the prohibition in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the Act (“the Chapter I prohibition”).
The block exemption applies to such agreements to the extent that they fall within the scope of section 2 of the Act (agreements etc. preventing, restricting or distorting competition ).
The block exemption applies from 1st January 2023 (see article 1(b)) and will cease to have effect at the end of 31st December 2035 (see article 20).
The block exemption may be cancelled before 31st December 2035 in respect of some R&D agreements if:
there is a breach of the conditions relating to access to the results of the research and development (see article 5), access to pre-existing know-how (see article 6) or joint exploitation (see article 7);
there is a breach of any of the conditions relating to market share and competition in innovation in article 8, although if the condition in article 8(8) relating to market shares following a period of joint exploitation is met initially, and only subsequently breached, the breach has the effect of cancelling the block exemption in respect of the agreement but only with effect from the end of the period of two consecutive calendar years following the year in which the market share threshold concerned was first exceeded (see article 11(2));
a hardcore restriction is included in the agreement (see article 10);
an excluded restriction is included in the agreement, although if the excluded restriction is severable from the agreement the block exemption is cancelled only in respect of the excluded restriction (see articles 12(1) and 13);
the CMA cancels the effect of the exemption:
because of a failure of an undertaking to provide it with information about the agreement (see article 14(2));
because it considers that a particular agreement is not one which is exempt from the Chapter I prohibition as a result of section 9 of the Act (see article 15(1)).
The CMA is given a power to ask for information about agreements to which a person is a party (see article 14(1)).
A transitional provision also ensures that the Chapter I prohibition does not apply for 12 months to pre-existing agreements which satisfied the conditions for exemption provided for in Commission Regulation (EU) 1217/2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of research and development agreements (EUR 2010/1217)but which do not otherwise satisfy the conditions for exemption provided for in this Order. A further transitional provision ensures that new requirements designed to protect competition in innovation apply only in relation to R&D agreements entered into on or after 1st January 2024.
The Order also amends two retained block exemption regulations (as defined in section 10(12) of the Act) to update references in those regulations to other retained block exemption regulations which have expired, or are about to expire, so that they are instead references to block exemption orders under section 6 of the Act (including this Order) intended to replace the expired or expiring retained block exemption regulations.
Guidance on the block exemption is available from the CMA online at http://www.gov.uk/cma or by writing to Competition and Markets Authority, The Cabot, 25 Cabot Square, London E14 4QZ.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared for this Order and is available alongside this instrument on the UK Legislation website www.legislation.gov.uk.

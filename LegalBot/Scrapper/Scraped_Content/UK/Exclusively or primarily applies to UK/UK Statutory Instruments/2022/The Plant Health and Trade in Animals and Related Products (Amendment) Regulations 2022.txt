S.I. 2022/1322.Mark Spencer
Minister of State
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
At 11.40 a.m. on 19th December 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(b), (c), (d), (f) and (g) and (3)(a) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
They do so by correcting an amendment that was made to Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and of the Council on protective measures against pests of plants (EUR 2016/2031) (“the Plant Health Regulation”) by the Plant Health (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1482), which failed fully to remedy the deficiency.
They also correct amendments made to Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1614 authorising Member States to provide for derogations from certain provisions of Council Directive 2000/29/EC in respect of potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, originating in the regions of Akkar and Bekaa of Lebanon (EUDN 2019/1614) (“Decision 2019/1614”) by the Animals, Food, Plant Health, Plant Propagating Material and Seeds (Miscellaneous Amendments etc.) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1090), which did not fully remedy the deficiencies in that Decision.
Additionally, they amend the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Amendment and Legislative Functions) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1322) (“the Trade in Animals etc. Regulations”), replacing references to EU legislation with regulation-making powers.
Regulation 2 amends the Plant Health Regulation to insert references to Annex 2A to Commission Implementing Regulation (EUR) 2019/2072 establishing uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and the Council, as regards protective measures against pests of plants (EUR 2019/2072) (“the Phytosanitary Conditions Regulation”). Annex 2A to that Regulation was inserted by the Plant Health (Phytosanitary Conditions) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1527), but S.I 2020/1482 (which made corresponding amendments to the Plant Health Regulation) failed to make all the amendments to the Plant Health Regulation necessary to reflect the insertion of Annex 2A.
Regulation 2 also makes amendments to Article 18 of the Plant Health Regulation to allow competent authorities in relation to each of the territories of Great Britain to cooperate with one another in demarcating areas affected by plant pests (including diseases). These amendments allow neighbouring authorities to take measures to control the spread of plant pests which are present in, or are likely to spread to, a neighbouring territory.
Regulations 3 to 5 make consequential amendments to EU-derived domestic legislation in relation to, respectively, England, Scotland and Wales to allow the authorities in each of these territories to collaborate in controlling plant pests identified in any territory of Great Britain which have spread, or are liable to spread, to another territory. Regulation 6 makes amendments to the Welsh language version of the Official Controls (Plant Health and Genetically Modified Organisms) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/206 (W. 48) parallel to those made by regulation 5 to the version in English.
Regulation 7 makes amendments to Decision 2019/1614 to restore a requirement that consignments originating in specified areas of Lebanon which are, or may be, contaminated with Clavibacter Michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus should remain under official control and should not be moved. This regulation also provides for labelling of consignments to be in English and replaces references to standards set by EU Directives by references to appropriate international standards.
Regulation 8 amends the Trade in Animals etc. Regulations, which modify functions contained in in EU Directives. The amendments made by this regulation replace references to EU procedures governing the import of equine animals with powers for the appropriate authority to make regulations.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

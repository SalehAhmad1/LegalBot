(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies, in particular under 8(2)(a), (b) and (d), arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. These Regulations revoke EU legislative provisions that have continued to operate as part of domestic law since the end of the implementation period despite the fact that the United Kingdom has left the two EU agencies to which they relate.
Regulation (EC) No 1339/2008 is revoked since the United Kingdom no longer participates in the European Training Foundation. Regulation (EU) No 2019/128 is revoked since the United Kingdom no longer participates in the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, known as “Cedefop”.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

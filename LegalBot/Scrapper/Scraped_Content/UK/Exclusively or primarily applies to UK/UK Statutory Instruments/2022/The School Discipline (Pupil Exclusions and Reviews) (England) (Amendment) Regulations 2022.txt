(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, whilst extending to the legal jurisdiction of England and Wales, apply only in relation to England.
These Regulations amend The School Discipline (Pupil Exclusions and Reviews) (England) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/1033) which apply in relation to maintained schools, pupil referral units, Academy schools or alternative provision Academy schools in England.
These amendments provide for social workers and virtual school heads to be involved in the school exclusions process, by ensuring that they are notified of relevant decisions and given the opportunity to make representations and attend meetings relating to school exclusions. The amendments also require the local authority to be informed without delay of all school exclusions regardless of the length of the exclusion.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

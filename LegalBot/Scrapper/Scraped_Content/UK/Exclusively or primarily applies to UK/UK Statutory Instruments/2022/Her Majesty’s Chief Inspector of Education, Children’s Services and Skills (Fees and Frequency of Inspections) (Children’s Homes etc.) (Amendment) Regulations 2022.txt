(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply to England only, amend Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills (Fees and Frequency of Inspections) (Children’s Homes etc.) Regulations 2015 (“the principal Regulations”).
These Regulations prescribe fees that are payable to Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills (“the Chief Inspector”) in respect of multi-building children’s homes, which are registered by the Chief Inspector and defined in regulation 4 of these Regulations as a children’s home where the care and accommodation is provided in more than one building. Regulations 5 and 6 of these Regulations amend regulations 6 and 14 of the principal Regulations to set out the registration and variation fees payable for multi-building children’s homes (as well as for children’s homes that are not small children’s homes).
Regulation 7 amends regulation 19 of the principal Regulations to lower the approved places threshold (see regulation 2 of the principal Regulations for the definition of “approved places”) in respect of which a residential college must pay a higher annual fee, from between 4 – 11 places to 4 – 10 places.
Regulation 8 amends regulation 23 of the principal Regulations to lower the approved places threshold in respect of which a children’s home must pay a higher annual fee, from between 4 – 29 places to 4 – 26 places. It also prescribes the annual fees to be paid by a multi-building children’s home, depending on the number of approved places.
Regulation 9 amends regulation 27 of the principal Regulations. The effect of the amendment is to extend the time available for the Chief Inspector to inspect premises due an inspection as a result of regulation 27(1)(b) and to restart the three year period for inspections in respect of these.
Regulation 10 and the Schedule also amend the principal Regulations in respect of fees, setting out the increases in certain other fees payable by various settings under Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the principal Regulations.

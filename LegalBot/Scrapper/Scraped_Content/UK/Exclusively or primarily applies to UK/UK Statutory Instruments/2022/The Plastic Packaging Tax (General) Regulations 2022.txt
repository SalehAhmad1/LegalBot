(a)
undertake a determination under paragraph (3); or
(b)
obtain that determination from another person,
and keep a record of it in writing.
(2) The result of that determination must be that the relevant packaging component does not fall within the definition of “plastic packaging component” in section 48(3) of the Act.
(3) A determination must state—
(a)
the weight of plastic contained in a relevant packaging component;
(b)
the weight of each of the single substances listed in regulation 4 contained in the relevant packaging component; and
(c)
whether the relevant packaging component contains more plastic, according to the weight given under sub-paragraph (a), than any other single substance in respect of each of which the weight is given under sub-paragraph (b).
(4) Where relevant packaging components are within a product line, a determination under paragraph (3) may be made by reference to an indicative component rather than to each relevant packaging component within that product line.
(5) Where relevant packaging components are part of a production run, a determination under paragraph (3) may be made by reference to an indicative component of that production run by applying the calculation under paragraph (6), rather than to each relevant packaging component of that production run.
(6) Where the procedure in paragraph (5) is applied, the calculation of the weight of plastic and the weight of each of the single substances listed in regulation 4 contained in an indicative component must be calculated in accordance with the formula—
Where
W is the weight of plastic or the weight of each of the single substances listed in regulation 4 contained in the indicative component.
T is the weight of plastic or the weight of each of the single substances listed in regulation 4 used in the production run.
N is the number of relevant packaging components in the production run.
(7) Where relevant packaging components are within a product line, a determination under paragraph (3) may be made by reference to the design specifications of a relevant packaging component rather than to each relevant packaging component within that product line provided that the following conditions are met—
(a)
the design specifications include—
(i)
the weight of the relevant packaging component;
(ii)
the weight of plastic to be used in the relevant packaging component;

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Regulations make provision for plastic packaging tax, introduced by Part 2 of the Finance Act 2021 (c. 26) (“the Act”).
Regulation 1 provides for citation and commencement, regulation 2 gives definitions used in the Regulations and regulation 3 defines the term “prescribed”.
Regulations 4 and 5 set out how to determine whether a packaging component containing plastic is a plastic packaging component, including listing the substances other than plastic that must be measured to determine whether a packaging component that contains plastic is or is not a plastic packaging component.
Regulations 6 and 7 set out the method for calculating the recycled plastic content of a plastic packaging component and require a person to have “sufficient evidence” that plastic is recycled plastic and for the Commissioners to prescribe what sufficient evidence constitutes.
Regulation 8 defines the term “substantial modification” for the purposes of determining when a plastic packaging component is finished (see section 47 of the Act).
Regulations 9 to 11 make provision for when the direct export condition (see section 51 of the Act) ceases to be met, require “sufficient evidence” to be kept if the direct export condition ceases to be met and require the Commissioners to prescribe what “sufficient evidence” means. They also specify the further conditions that apply for the direct export condition to be met.
Regulations 12 to 19 make provision requiring the Commissioners to prescribe what “sufficient evidence” means, setting out the cases in which a liable person is entitled to a tax credit, the procedure for claiming a tax credit and the payment by the Commissioners of tax credits, the repayment of tax credits to the Commissioners, records that must be kept in relation to a tax credit claim, for entitlements to tax credits where a person becomes a member of a group or ceases to carry on a business or is no longer liable to pay the tax.
Regulations 20 to 22 make provision requiring the Commissioners to prescribe the form and manner of a notification of liability to be registered, sets out the information that must be included in such a notification, require a record of evidence to be kept in relation to it and provides the circumstances when a person must notify the Commissioners of any corrections to the register and for the register to be corrected by the Commissioners as they see fit.
Regulations 23 to 26 make provision in relation to the measurement of weight for plastic packaging tax, specifying the time by reference to which weight should be measured, permitting the Commissioners to agree a method for measuring weight and requiring the Commissioners to prescribe specified rules for measuring weight where an agreed method is not used, not complied with, or that method does not apply. Regulation 27 sets out a requirement to re-weigh in certain circumstances. Regulation 28 sets out the records to be kept in relation to weighing.
Regulation 29 allows the Commissioners to determine the weight of any thing to the best of their judgement in certain circumstances and substitute their determination for any measurement or calculation of weight made by any person.
Regulations 30 to 38 make provision applying the regulations on accounting and returns to persons liable to be registered for plastic packaging tax, setting out the accounting periods which apply to the tax, when payment of the tax must be made and for the Commissioners to prescribe the method by which payment must be made. These regulations require persons liable to be registered for the tax to make a return for each accounting period (and set out the timing for doing so), set out the form and manner of the return and what it must include and for errors in a return to be corrected as prescribed by the Commissioners (and the timing for doing so). These provisions also require persons liable to be registered to keep accounts for each accounting period, set out what the accounts must include and the period for preserving those accounts. These regulations also provide for records to be kept as prescribed by the Commissioners, as well as providing for a further record-keeping requirement in relation to waste or surplus material attached to a plastic packaging component at the time of the chargeable event and the period for which records required to be kept by or under the Act must be preserved.

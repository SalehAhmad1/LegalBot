26th October 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Digital Government (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/912) (“the 2018 Regulations”). The 2018 Regulations provide for the disclosure of information for the purpose of certain specified public service delivery objectives, in accordance with Chapter 1 of Part 5 of the Digital Economy Act 2017 (c. 30) (“the 2017 Act”).
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends paragraph 1 of the Schedule to the 2018 Regulations to include a new objective, the Scottish early learning and childcare objective, and to specify persons from the list of specified persons set out in Schedule 4 to the 2017 Act who may share and receive information for the purpose of that objective. Regulation 2 also inserts a new paragraph 6 in the Schedule to the 2018 Regulations setting out the new objective, which is to identify and contact households in Scotland with two-year-olds eligible for the mandatory amount of funded early learning and childcare (as provided for in sections 47 and 48 of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014), in order that it can be made available to them.
These Regulations thus permit the disclosure of information between His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Scottish Ministers and Scottish councils, with a view to increasing uptake of funded early learning and childcare among eligible two-year-olds in Scotland.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

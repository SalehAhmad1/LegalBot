INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING
The Portishead Branch Line (MetroWest Phase 1) Order 2022
Made
14th November 2022
Coming into force
5th December 2022
An application has been made to the Secretary of State under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008(1) (“the 2008 Act”) in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009(2) for an order granting development consent.
The application was examined in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010(3) by a Panel of two members (“the Panel”) appointed by the Secretary of State in accordance with Chapter 2 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act.
The Panel, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn and the application with the accompanying documents, has, in accordance with section 74(2) of the 2008 Act, made a report and recommendation to the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn and the report of the Panel, has decided to make an Order granting development consent for the development described in the application with modifications which in the opinion of the Secretary of State do not make any substantial change to the proposals comprised in the application.
In accordance with section 131(5) of the 2008 Act the Secretary of State is satisfied that where this Order authorises the compulsory acquisition of land forming part of an open space being the cycle track special category land (as defined in article 54 of this Order) that land is less than 200 square metres in extent and the giving in exchange of other land is unnecessary, whether in the interests of the persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other rights or in the interests of the public.
In accordance with section 132(3) of the 2008 Act the Secretary of State is satisfied that where this Order authorises the compulsory acquisition of a right over other land forming part of an open space that land, when burdened with the order right, will be no less advantageous than it was before to the persons in whom it is vested, other persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other rights in the land, and the public.
The Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 114, 115, 117, 120 and 122 of, and paragraphs 1 to 3, 10 to 17, 20, 23, 24, 26, 33, 34, 36 and 37 of Part 1 of Schedule 5 to, the 2008 Act, makes the following Order—

PART 2
Procedure for discharge of requirements
Applications made under requirements
38.—(1) Where a valid application has been made to the relevant planning authority for any consent, agreement or approval required or contemplated by a requirement (including agreement or approval in respect of part of a requirement) included in this Order, the relevant planning authority must give notice to the undertaker of the decision on the application within a period of 8 weeks beginning with—
(a)
the day immediately following that on which the relevant planning authority acknowledge the application;
(b)
the day immediately following that on which further information has been supplied by the undertaker under paragraph 39 (further information); or
(c)
such longer period as may be agreed between the undertaker and the relevant planning authority.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), in the event that the relevant planning authority does not determine an application within the period set out in sub-paragraph (1), the relevant planning authority is taken to have granted all parts of the application (without any condition or qualification) at the end of that period.
(3) Where—
(a)
an application has been made to the relevant planning authority for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order;
(b)
the relevant planning authority does not determine such application within the period set out in sub-paragraph (1); and
(c)
the application is accompanied by a report that considers it likely that the subject matter of the application is to give rise to any materially new or materially different environmental effects from those reported in the environmental statement,
then the application is taken to have been refused by the relevant planning authority at the end of that period.
(4) Sub-paragraph (2) will only apply to an application made under requirements if—
(a)
at least 6 weeks have elapsed since the application was received by the relevant planning authority;
(b)
the undertaker has served on the relevant planning authority written notice that sub-paragraph (2) will apply from a date specified in the notice (such date not being less than 8 weeks from the date the application was received by the relevant planning authority); and

Further information
39.—(1) In relation to any part of an application made under this Schedule, the relevant planning authority has the right to request such further information from the undertaker as is necessary to enable the relevant planning authority to consider the application.
(2) In the event that the relevant planning authority considers such further information to be necessary, the relevant planning authority must, within 20 business days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing specifying the further information required and (if applicable) to which part of the application it relates. In the event that the relevant planning authority does not give such notification within this 20 day period the relevant planning authority is deemed to have sufficient information to consider the application and is not subsequently entitled to request further information without the prior agreement of the undertaker.
(3) Where further information is requested under this paragraph in relation to part only of an application, that part is treated as separate from the remainder of the application for the purposes of calculating the time periods referred to in paragraph 38 (applications made under requirements) and in this paragraph.
Appeals
40.—(1) The undertaker may appeal in the event that—
(a)
the relevant planning authority refuses an application for any consent, agreement or approval required or contemplated by any of the provisions of this Order or grants it subject to conditions;
(b)
the relevant planning authority does not give notice of its decision to the undertaker within the decision period specified in paragraph 38(1) (applications made under requirements);
(c)
on receipt of a request for further information under paragraph 39 (further information) the undertaker considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the relevant planning authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or
(d)
on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant planning authority notifies the undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the application.
(2) The appeal process is as follows—
(a)
any appeal by the undertaker must be made within 42 days of the date of the notice of the decision or determination, or (where no determination has been made) expiry of the decision period as determined under paragraph 38;
(b)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning authority and the requirement consultees;
(c)
as soon as is practicable after receiving the appeal documentation, the Secretary of State must appoint a person to determine the appeal (“the appointed person”)(1) and must notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for that person’s attention should be sent;
(d)
the relevant planning authority and the requirement consultees must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within 20 business days of the date on which the appeal parties are notified of the appointment of a person under paragraph (c) and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(e)
the appeal parties must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within 20 business days of receipt of written representations under paragraph (d).
(3) The appointed person must make a decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable.
(4) The appointment of the appointed person may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(5) If the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable consideration of the appeal the appointed person must, as soon as practicable, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required, the appeal party from whom the information is sought, and the date by which the information is to be submitted.
(6) Any further information required under sub-paragraph (5) is to be provided by the party from whom the information is sought to the appointed person and to other appeal parties by the date specified by the appointed person. Any written representations concerning matters contained in the further information must be submitted to the appointed person, and made available to all appeal parties within 10 business days of that date.
(7) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal; or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant planning authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not),
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to the appointed person in the first instance.
(8) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the prescribed time limits, or set by the appointed person under this paragraph.
(9) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have been made within the prescribed time limits, if it appears to the appointed person that there is sufficient material to enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case.
(10) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the appeal parties, and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(11) If an approval is given by the appointed person under this Schedule, it is deemed to be an approval for the purpose of any consent, agreement or approval required under this Order or for the purpose of this Schedule as if it had been given by the discharging authority. The discharging authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.
(12) Except where a direction is given under sub-paragraph (13) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person are to be met by the undertaker(2).
(13) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to the Planning Practice Guidance on Appeals published by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 3 March 2014 or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

SCHEDULE 11
Modification of compensation and compulsory purchase enactments for creation of new rights and imposition of restrictive covenants
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation for the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A)(1) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 11 to the Portishead Branch Line (MetroWest Phase 1) Order 2022 (“the 2022 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 11 to the 2022 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land where it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(2) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 25 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 24 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 27(1) (compulsory acquisition of rights or imposition of covenants)—
(a)
with the modification specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restrictive covenant is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 24), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 25(4) (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A

Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 (execution of declaration) of the 1981 Act as applied by article 30 (application of the 1981 Act) of the Portishead Branch Line (MetroWest Phase 1) Order 2022 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 31(3) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the Portishead Branch Line (MetroWest Phase 1) Order 2022 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or restrictive covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or restrictive covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

(3) If by the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which written notice was served upon the engineer under sub-paragraph (2), Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct any part of a specified work which in the opinion of the engineer will or may affect the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker desires such part of the specified work to be constructed, Network Rail must construct it with all reasonable dispatch on behalf of and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to be approved or settled under this paragraph, and under the supervision (where appropriate and if given) of the undertaker.
(4) When signifying approval of the plans the engineer may specify any protective works (whether temporary or permanent) which in his opinion should be carried out before the commencement of the construction of a specified work to ensure the safety or stability of railway property or the continuation of safe and efficient operation of the railways of Network Rail or the services of operators using the same (including any relocation, de-commissioning and removal of works, apparatus and equipment necessitated by a specified work and the comfort and safety of passengers who may be affected by the specified works), and such protective works as may be reasonably necessary for those purposes must be constructed by Network Rail or by the undertaker, if Network Rail so desires, and such protective works must be carried out at the expense of the undertaker in either case with all reasonable dispatch and the undertaker must not commence the construction of the specified works until the engineer has notified the undertaker that the protective works have been completed to the engineer’s reasonable satisfaction.
6.—(1) Any specified work and any protective works to be constructed by virtue of paragraph 5(4) must, when commenced, be constructed—
(a)
with all reasonable dispatch in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to have been approved or settled under paragraph 5;
(b)
under the supervision (where appropriate and if given) and to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer;
(c)
in such manner as to cause as little damage as is possible to railway property; and
(d)
so far as is reasonably practicable, so as not to interfere with or obstruct the free, uninterrupted and safe use of any railway of Network Rail or the traffic thereon and the use by passengers of railway property.
(2) If any damage to railway property or any such interference or obstruction is caused by the carrying out of, or in consequence of the construction of a specified work, the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval, make good such damage and must pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may sustain by reason of any such damage, interference or obstruction.
(3) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of Network Rail or its servants, contractors or agents or any liability on Network Rail with respect of any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of the undertaker or its servants, contractors or agents.
7.  The undertaker must—
(a)
at all times afford reasonable facilities to the engineer for access to a specified work during its construction; and
(b)
supply the engineer with all such information as the engineer may reasonably require with regard to a specified work or the method of constructing it.
8.  Network Rail must at all times afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker and its agents for access to any works carried out by Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule during their construction and must supply the undertaker with such information as it may reasonably require with regard to such works or the method of constructing them.
9.—(1) If any permanent or temporary alterations or additions to railway property, are reasonably necessary in consequence of the construction of a specified work, or during a period of 24 months after the completion of that work in order to ensure the safety of railway property or the continued safe operation of the railway of Network Rail, such alterations and additions may be carried out by Network Rail and if Network Rail gives to the undertaker reasonable notice of its intention to carry out such alterations or additions (which must be specified in the notice), the undertaker must pay to Network Rail the reasonable cost of those alterations or additions including, in respect of any such alterations and additions as are to be permanent, a capitalised sum representing the increase of the costs which may be expected to be reasonably incurred by Network Rail in maintaining, working and, when necessary, renewing any such alterations or additions.
(2) If during the construction of a specified work by the undertaker, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct that part of the specified work which in the opinion of the engineer is endangering the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker decides that part of the specified work is to be constructed, Network Rail must assume construction of that part of the specified work and the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval of a specified work under paragraph 5(3), pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may suffer by reason of the execution by Network Rail of that specified work.
(3) The engineer must, in respect of the capitalised sums referred to in this paragraph and paragraph 10(a) provide such details of the formula by which those sums have been calculated as the undertaker may reasonably require.
(4) If the cost of maintaining, working or renewing railway property is reduced in consequence of any such alterations or additions a capitalised sum representing such saving must be set off against any sum payable by the undertaker to Network Rail under this paragraph.

(a)
in constructing any part of a specified work on behalf of the undertaker as provided by paragraph 5(3) or in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 5(4) including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signalmen, watchmen and other persons whom it is reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer, require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or from the substitution of diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work.
11.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
“Network Rail’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised development) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 5(1) for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 5(1)) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 5(1) has effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) If at any time prior to the commencement of regular revenue-earning operations on the authorised railway comprised in the authorised development and notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing or commissioning of the authorised development causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI; and
(c)

(8) Where Network Rail approves modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus pursuant to sub-paragraphs (5) or (6)—
(a)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
(b)
any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus approved pursuant to those sub-paragraphs must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 6.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 15(1) applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses suffered by Network Rail through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Network Rail’s apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which sub-paragraph (6) applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 10(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph are deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
(11) In relation to any dispute arising under this paragraph the reference in article 56 (arbitration) to the Institution of Civil Engineers shall be read as a reference to the Institution of Electrical Engineers.
12.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.
13.  The undertaker must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Network Rail unless it has first consulted Network Rail and it must comply with Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.
14.  Any additional expenses which Network Rail may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the undertaker, be repaid by the undertaker to Network Rail.
15.—(1) The undertaker must pay to Network Rail all reasonable costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part of this Schedule which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Network Rail by reason of—
(a)
the construction or maintenance of a specified work or the failure thereof; or
(b)
any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged upon a specified work,
and the undertaker must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or any such failure, act or omission: and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision does not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Network Rail must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand is to be made without the prior consent of the undertaker.
(3) The sums payable by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) are to include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs.
(4) Subject to the terms of any agreement between Network Rail and a train operator regarding the timing or method of payment of the relevant costs in respect of that train operator, Network Rail must promptly pay to each train operator the amount of any sums which Network Rail receives under sub-paragraph (3) which relates to the relevant costs of that train operator.
(5) The obligation under sub-paragraph (3) to pay Network Rail the relevant costs is, in the event of default, enforceable directly by any train operator concerned to the extent that such sums would be payable to that operator pursuant to sub‑paragraph (4).
(6) In this paragraph—
“the relevant costs” means the costs, direct losses and expenses (including loss of revenue) reasonably incurred by each train operator as a consequence of any restriction of the use of Network Rail’s railway network as a result of the construction, maintenance or failure of a specified work or any such act or omission as mentioned in subparagraph (1); and
“train operator” means any person who is authorised to act as the operator of a train by a licence under section 8 (licences) of the Railways Act 1993.

17.  In the assessment of any sums payable to Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule there must not be taken into account any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken by or any agreement entered into by Network Rail if that action or agreement was not reasonably necessary and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or increasing the sums so payable.
18.  The undertaker and Network Rail may, subject in the case of Network Rail to compliance with the terms of its network licence, enter into, and carry into effect, agreements for the transfer to the undertaker of—
(a)
any railway property shown on the lands plans and described in the book of reference;
(b)
any lands, works or other property held in connection with any such railway property; and
(c)
any rights and obligations (whether or not statutory) of Network Rail relating to any railway property or any lands, works or other property referred to in this paragraph.
19.  Nothing in this Order, or in any enactment incorporated with or applied by this Order, prejudices or affects the operation of Part 1 of the Railways Act 1993.
20.  The undertaker must give written notice to Network Rail if any application is proposed to be made by the undertaker for the Secretary of State’s consent, under article 10 (consent to transfer benefit of order) of this Order and any such notice must be given no later than 28 days before any such application is made and must describe or give (as appropriate)—
(a)
the nature of the application to be made;
(b)
the extent of the geographical area to which the application relates; and

On street apparatus
24.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Acquisition of land
25.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
26.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 56, and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
27.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway which forms or is to form part of Network Rail’s network and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the undertaker or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
28.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works of the type referred to in paragraph 26(2) that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 26(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub–paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 23 to 27 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 26(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses and costs
29.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 26(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
30.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraph 26(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
31.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker or Network Rail and a utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker or Network Rail on the date on which this Order is made.

(4) Where under sub-paragraph (2) or (3) BPC’s approval to plans submitted by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) cannot be unreasonably withheld or delayed if by the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which such plans have been supplied to BPC, BPC has not intimated disapproval of those plans and the grounds of disapproval the undertaker may serve upon BPC written notice requiring BPC to intimate approval or disapproval within a further period of 28 days beginning with the date upon which BPC receives written notice from the undertaker. If by expiry of the further period of 28 days BPC has not intimated approval or disapproval, BPC is deemed to have approved the plans as submitted.
(5) When signifying approval of plans submitted under sub-paragraph (1), BPC may specify any protective works (whether temporary or permanent) which in BPC’s opinion should be carried out before the commencement of the construction of a specified work to ensure the safety or stability of BPC’s property or the continuation of safe and efficient operation of the Port (including the Port’s railway) and such protective works as may be reasonably necessary for those purposes are to be constructed by BPC but at the expense of the undertaker, or if BPC so desires such protective works must be carried out by the undertaker at its own expense with all reasonable dispatch, and the undertaker must not commence the construction of the specified work until BPC has notified the undertaker that the protective works have been completed to BPC’s reasonable satisfaction.
(6) When signifying approval of plans submitted under sub-paragraph (1) in relation to Work No. 18, BPC may specify any environmental protection works which in BPC’s reasonable opinion should be implemented before the commencement of, or during, the construction of Work No. 18 and such environmental protection works as may be reasonably necessary for those purposes are to be implemented by BPC but at the expense of the undertaker, or if BPC so desires such environmental protection works must be implemented by the undertaker at its own expense with all reasonable dispatch, and except to the extent BPC may agree the undertaker must not commence the construction of the specified work until BPC has notified the undertaker that any and all relevant environmental protection works have been implemented to BPC’s reasonable satisfaction.
56.—(1) Any specified work and any protective works (and any environmental protection works connected with Work No. 18) to be constructed or implemented by virtue of paragraph 55(5) or 55(6) must, when commenced, be constructed and implemented with all reasonable dispatch in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to have been approved under paragraph 55—
(a)
under BPC’s supervision (where appropriate and if given) and to BPC’s reasonable satisfaction;
(b)
in such manner as to cause as little damage as is possible to BPC’s property; and
(c)
so far as is reasonably practicable, so as not to interfere with or obstruct the free, uninterrupted and safe and efficient operation of the Port (including use of the Port’s railway or the traffic on it).
(2) If any damage to BPC’s property or any such interference or obstruction is caused by the carrying out of, or in consequence of the construction of, a specified work, the undertaker must, regardless of any approval described in paragraph 55(1), make good such damage and pay to BPC all reasonable expenses to which BPC may be put and compensation for any loss which it may sustain by reason of any such damage, interference or obstruction.
(3) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule imposes—
(a)
any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of BPC or its servants, contractors or agents; or
(b)
any liability on BPC with respect to any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of the undertaker or its servants, contractors or agents.
57.  The undertaker must—
(a)
at all times afford reasonable facilities to BPC’s representative (or to a person nominated by BPC’s representative) for access to a specified work during its construction; and
(b)
supply BPC with all such information as BPC’s representative may reasonably require with regard to a specified work or the method of constructing it.
58.  BPC must at all times afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker and its agents for access to any works carried out by BPC under this Part during their construction and must supply the undertaker with such information as it may reasonably require with regard to such works or the method of constructing them.
59.—(1) If any permanent or temporary alterations or additions to BPC’s property, or any protective works under paragraph 55(5), are reasonably necessary during the construction of a specified work, or during a period of 12 months after the opening for public use of any part of the authorised development that includes a specified work, in consequence of the construction of that specified work, such alterations and additions may be carried out by BPC and if BPC gives to the undertaker reasonable notice of its intention to carry out such alterations or additions, the undertaker must pay to BPC all costs reasonably and properly incurred in constructing those alterations or additions including, in respect of any such alterations and additions as are to be permanent, a capitalised sum representing the increase of the costs which may be expected to be reasonably incurred by BPC in maintaining, working and, when necessary, renewing any such alterations or additions.
(2) If the cost of maintaining, working or renewing BPC’s property is reduced in consequence of any such alterations or additions a capitalised sum representing such saving must be set off against any sum payable by the undertaker to BPC under this paragraph.
60.  The undertaker must repay to BPC all fees, costs, charges and expenses reasonably and properly incurred by BPC—
(a)
in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 55(5) and in the implementing of any environmental protection works under the provisions of paragraph 55(6) including, in respect of any permanent protective works or permanent environmental protection works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of BPC’s representative’s approval of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by BPC of the construction of a specified work and otherwise in connection with the implementation of the provisions of this Part;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any persons whom it is reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, watching and lighting BPC’s property (including the Port’s railway) and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work; and
(d)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of BPC’s property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work.
61.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work BPC gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation or use of any of BPC’s property (including the Port’s railway) in connection with carrying on BPC’s statutory undertaking, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as not to adversely affect the operation or use of such property in that connection.
62.  Any additional expenses which BPC may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing, working, or maintaining under any powers existing at the making of this Order any of BPC’s property in connection with carrying on BPC’s statutory undertaking by reason of the existence of a specified work, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction, working or maintenance has been given to the undertaker, are to be repaid by the undertaker to BPC.
63.—(1) The undertaker must pay to BPC all costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part (but subject to article 41 (no double recovery)) which may be occasioned to or reasonably and properly incurred by BPC—
(a)
by reason of the construction, working, maintenance of a specified work or the failure of such a work; or
(b)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged upon a specified work,
and the undertaker must indemnify BPC from and against all costs, claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or any such failure, act or omission; and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by BPC on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by BPC or in accordance with any requirement of BPC’s representative or under BPC’s representative’s supervision will not (if it was done without negligence on the part of BPC or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) BPC must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand made by a third party as soon as reasonably practicable after BPC becomes aware of it and must make no settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand in excess of £10,000 without the prior consent of the undertaker (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
64.  BPC must, on receipt of a request from the undertaker, from time to time provide free of charge with written estimates of the costs, charges, expenses and other liabilities for which the undertaker is or will become liable under this Part and with such information as may reasonably enable the undertaker to assess the reasonableness of any such estimate or claim made or to be made under this Part.
65.  In the assessment of any sums payable to BPC under this Part there must not be taken into account any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken by or any agreement entered into by BPC if that action or agreement was not reasonably necessary and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the undertaker under this Part or increasing the sums so payable.

PART 6
Protection for Exolum Pipeline System Ltd
71.  The provisions of this Part have effect for the protection of the Exolum undertaker referred to in this Part unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the Exolum undertaker.
72.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the Exolum undertaker to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means the pipeline, or any part of it, belonging to or maintained by the Exolum undertaker, which is within the Order limits, and includes any structure in which that apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus;
“Exolum undertaker” means Exolum Pipeline System Ltd (registered company number 09497223) or any successor in title to the Exolum undertaker in respect of the apparatus;
“functions” includes powers and duties; and
“in” in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land.
73.  Despite any provision of this Order or anything shown on the land plan, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
74.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which the apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part and any right of the Exolum undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exolum undertaker.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the Exolum undertaker written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed as a consequence of the removal of apparatus placed in the land referred to in sub-paragraph (2), the Exolum undertaker, must on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in other land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) The Exolum undertaker must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration), and after the grant to the Exolum undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part.
(5) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (4), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the Exolum undertaker that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus, that work, instead of being executed by the Exolum undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exolum undertaker.
(6) Nothing in sub-paragraph (5) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
75.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works of the type referred to in paragraph 74(2) that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under that sub-paragraph, the undertaker must submit to the Exolum undertaker a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the Exolum undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the Exolum undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 15 metres measured in any direction of the apparatus or (wherever situated) will impose any load directly upon the apparatus or involve embankment works within 15 metres of the apparatus, the information to be submitted to the Exolum undertaker under paragraph 75(1) shall be submitted not less than 35 days before the works are started and shall include a method statement describing—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which the works are to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal;
(d)
the position of the apparatus; and
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to the apparatus,
to permit the Exolum undertaker to assess whether any protective works or monitoring of adjoining activities or works are necessary, acting reasonably.
(4) Any requirements made by the Exolum undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 28 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) re-submitted to it.
(5) If the Exolum undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (4) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraph 74 applies as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) of that paragraph.
(6) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(7) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the Exolum undertaker notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of the works referred to in sub-paragraph (1) as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) and sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(8) Where, in the reasonable opinion of the Exolum undertaker or the undertaker, anything done in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order might interfere with the cathodic protection forming part of apparatus or any apparatus might interfere with the proposed or existing cathodic protection forming part of the undertaker’s works, the Exolum undertaker and the undertaker must co-operate in carrying out any tests which they consider reasonably necessary for ascertaining the nature and extent of such interference, and measures reasonably necessary for providing or preserving such cathodic protection.
76.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to the Exolum undertaker the proper and reasonable expenses reasonably incurred by the Exolum undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus including those expenses incurred through stopping and restoring supply to the apparatus.
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
77.—(1) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the Exolum undertaker by virtue of paragraph 76(1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), the extension of the apparatus to a length greater than the length of the existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus.
(3) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the Exolum undertaker in respect of works by virtue of paragraph 76(1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the Exolum undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
78.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker or Network Rail and the Exolum undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker or Network Rail on the date on which this Order is made.

81.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and WPD are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
No acquisition or extinguishment except by agreement
82.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
83.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that WPD’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of WPD to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation and access to it has been provided if necessary to the reasonable satisfaction of WPD in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (11).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to WPD written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order WPD reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (2)(a), (b) and (c), afford to WPD the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land owned or controlled by the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus—
(a)
if, for the purpose of executing any works, the undertaker requires to remove or divert any apparatus placed within the Order land, and alternative apparatus or any part of such alternative apparatus is to be constructed in land other than the Order land as a consequence of the removal or diversion of apparatus, then the undertaker shall use its reasonable endeavours to obtain alternative rights in other land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed;
(b)
should the undertaker not be able to obtain the alternative rights required under paragraph (a) then the undertaker and WPD shall use reasonable endeavours to agree a reasonably practicable and mutually agreeable alternative engineering solution which does not require alternative apparatus to be constructed in land other than Order land and does not require alternative rights;
(c)
if alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker and the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in paragraph (a) and an alternative engineering solution cannot be agreed in accordance with paragraph (b), WPD must on receipt of written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to a requirement on WPD to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless WPD elects to do so.
(3) Any alternative apparatus required pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between WPD and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled in accordance with paragraph 86.
(4) WPD must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled pursuant to paragraph 86, and after the grant to WPD of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(5) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (4), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to WPD that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by WPD, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of WPD.
(6) Nothing in sub-paragraph (5) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 600 millimetres of the apparatus.
(7) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to WPD facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and WPD or in default of agreement settled in accordance with paragraph 86.
(8) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in the land of the undertaker, the expert must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised development and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the undertaker; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in the land for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(9) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the expert less favourable on the whole to WPD than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the expert must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to WPD as appears to the expert to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
(10) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule WPD require that alternative apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions, or at a greater depth is necessary in substitution for existing apparatus which for WPD’s network requirements is over and above what is necessary as a consequence of and for the purpose of the authorised development WPD must deduct the cost of such additional requirements from the amount payable by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 85(1).
(11) For the purposes of sub–paragraph (10)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
84.—(1) Not less than 28 days before the undertaker intends to start the execution of any specified work, the undertaker must submit to WPD a plan, section and description of the works to be executed. Any submission must note the time limits imposed on WPD under sub-paragraph (3).
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) the undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (1) applies until WPD has given written approval of the plan so submitted, and identified any reasonable requirements it has in relation to the carrying out of the works such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(3) If by the expiry of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted WPD has not advised the undertaker in writing of its approval or disapproval of the plans and any reasonable requirements for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, it shall be deemed to have approved the plans, sections or descriptions as submitted.
(4) The works referred to in sub-paragraph (1) must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with any reasonable requirements as may be notified in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) by WPD and WPD is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(5) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order the undertaker must comply with WPD’s Avoidance of Danger from Electricity Overhead Lines and Underground Cables (2014), the Energy Network Association’s A Guide to the Safe Use of Mechanical Plant in the Vicinity of Electricity Overhead Lines (undated), the Health and Safety Executive’s GS6 Avoiding Danger from Overhead Power Lines and the Health and Safety Executive’s HSG47 Avoiding Danger from Underground Services (Third Edition) (2014) as the same may be replaced from time to time.
(6) If WPD, in accordance with sub–paragraph (2) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement subject to sub-paragraph (3), paragraphs 83(1) to (6) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph 83(2).
(7) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(8) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub–paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to WPD notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub–paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses and costs
85.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to WPD the proper and reasonable expenses reasonably incurred by WPD in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any alternative apparatus arising as a result of the powers conferred upon the undertaker pursuant to this Order.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any specified work, any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of WPD the undertaker is to—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by WPD in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
reimburse WPD for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs reasonably and properly incurred by WPD of such damage, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (2) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of WPD, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) WPD must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, is to have the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(5) WPD shall not be liable to the undertaker for any losses or costs incurred by the undertaker resulting from delays to the authorised development as a result of its failure to undertake works to deliver any alternative apparatus.

92.  The provisions of Part 2 of this Schedule do not apply in relation to National Grid or any apparatus of National Grid.
93.—(1) The undertaker and National Grid will co-operate and work together to secure that the works proposed to be carried out by National Grid under the powers of the 2016 Order and the authorised works to be carried out by the undertaker under this Order will so far as reasonably possible be programmed, and arrangements for the carrying out, use and maintenance of those works will be made, so as, so far as reasonably possible, to avoid undue delay or any conflict arising between the carrying out, use and maintenance of those proposed works and carrying out, use and maintenance of the authorised development.
(2) Any consent, agreement or approval by National Grid or the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Apparatus of National Grid in stopped up streets
94.—(1) Without prejudice to the generality of any other protection afforded to National Grid elsewhere in the Order, where any street is stopped up under article 14 (permanent stopping up of streets), if National Grid has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street National Grid will be entitled to the same rights in respect of such apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker will grant to National Grid, or will procure the granting to National Grid of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to it in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up of any such street or highway.

Acquisition of land
95.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker may not acquire or extinguish any land interest or apparatus or override any easement and/or other interest of National Grid, including any rights contained in the 2016 Order, otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker) that are subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement and/or other legal or land interest of National Grid and/or affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Grid and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Grid reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid unless otherwise agreed by National Grid, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure and/or secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works.
(3) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation and/or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation and/or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid and/or other enactments relied upon by National Grid as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Part of this Schedule shall prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 98 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, shall not be taken to constitute agreement under paragraph 95(1).
Removal of existing apparatus
96.—(1) If, in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 95 or in any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that National Grid’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid 56 days’ advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to National Grid to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 97(1)) the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, as soon as is reasonably possible and on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration).
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 56, and subject to the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
97.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Grid facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Grid.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 104 (arbitration) and the arbitrator shall make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
98.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 96(2) or otherwise, the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan of the works to be executed and seek from National Grid details of the underground extent of their electricity tower foundations.
(2) In relation to specified works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 15 metres measured in any direction of any existing apparatus, or involve embankment works within 15 metres of any existing apparatus, the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)

(4) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) apply until National Grid has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(5) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraphs (2) or (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (6) or (8); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) apply, National Grid may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any existing apparatus.
(7) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (5), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) or (8) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where National Grid requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required and National Grid shall give 56 days’ notice of such works from the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any existing apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 89 to 91 and 95 to 97 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 96(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must—
(a)
comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
comply with sub-paragraph (12) at all times.
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order, the undertaker must comply with National Grid’s policies for development near overhead lines EN43-8 and HSE’s guidance note 6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Lines”.
Expenses
99.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 96(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works; and
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
100.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by National Grid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of National Grid.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless National Grid fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
Enactments and agreements
101.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between National Grid and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
102.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or National Grid requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 96(2) or National Grid makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 98, the undertaker shall use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Grid’s undertaking and National Grid shall use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
Access
103.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 95(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
104.  Any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Grid under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration).
Notices
105.

108.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and WWU are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
109.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
110.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of WWU to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of WWU.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works authorised by this Order in, on, over, or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to WWU written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order WWU reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to WWU the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, WWU must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably practicable use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed, or agree with the undertaker an alternative route for the alternative apparatus over land in respect of which it is possible for the undertaker to obtain the relevant facilities and rights. For the avoidance of doubt, WWU shall not be obliged to exercise its compulsory purchase powers pursuant to the Gas Act 1986 in order to obtain any such facilities or rights and WWU shall retain an absolute discretion as to whether it shall choose to exercise those powers.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between WWU and the undertaker, or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration).
(5) WWU must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration as referred to in sub-paragraph (4) in accordance with article 56 (arbitration), and after the grant to WWU of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed as soon as reasonably practicable to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to WWU that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by WWU, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of WWU.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
111.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to WWU facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and WWU or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 56 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of the undertaker, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail and the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway which forms or is to form part of Network Rail’s network and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the undertaker or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to WWU than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to WWU as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
112.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works of the type referred to in paragraph 110(2) that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 110(2), the undertaker must submit to WWU a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by WWU for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and WWU is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by WWU under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If WWU in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 106 to 110 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 110(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency, but in that case it must give to WWU notice as soon as reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable if possible before carrying out those works, or if not, as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) For the avoidance of doubt, whenever the undertaker carries out any works in the vicinity of any apparatus of WWU and whether or not WWU has made any requirements pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) above, the undertaker must comply with—
(a)
all applicable health and safety laws, including the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015;
(b)
the Pipeline Safety Regulations 1996; and
(c)
the safety guidance published from time to time by WWU and the HSE.
113.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to WWU the reasonable expenses incurred by WWU in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including: costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose; and any reasonable legal or other professional costs properly incurred relating to any such works to apparatus, or to the provision of alternative apparatus) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 110(2).
(2) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule WWU require that alternative apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions, or at a greater depth is necessary in substitution for existing apparatus which for WWU’s requirements is over and above what is necessary as a consequence of and for the purpose of the authorised development WWU must deduct the cost of such additional requirements from the amount payable by the undertaker pursuant to sub-paragraph (1).
(3) For the purposes of sub–paragraph (2) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus.
(4) For the avoidance of doubt and subject to paragraph 108, the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) require the undertaker to repay the full costs of any works carried out to WWU’s apparatus, or in order to protect that apparatus, or in consequence of any works carried out in the vicinity of that apparatus by the undertaker.
114.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraph 110(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of WWU, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by WWU, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by WWU in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to WWU for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by WWU,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of WWU, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) WWU must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
115.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker or Network Rail and WWU in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker or Network Rail on the date on which this Order is made.
116.  The provisions of Part 2 of this Schedule do not apply in relation to WWU or any apparatus of WWU.

3EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order authorises North Somerset District Council to construct a new railway on the formation of the disused Portishead Branch Line railway and to carry out works to upgrade the existing freight only Parson Street to Royal Portbury Dock railway to allow it to be used for passenger railway services.
The purpose of this Order is to allow passenger services to run between Portishead and Bristol and to connect into the wider national railway network. The railway will, once open to passenger services, be owned and maintained by Network Rail Infrastructure Limited.
The works also necessitate the diversion of an existing public footpath that crosses the railway at Barons Close, Ashton, Bristol.
The Order permits North Somerset District Council to acquire, compulsorily or by agreement, land and rights in land and to use land for this purpose.
The Order also makes provision in connection with the maintenance of the new section of railway.
A copy of the plans and book of reference referred to in this Order and certified in accordance with article 55 (documents to be certified) of this Order may be inspected free of charge during working hours at the offices of North Somerset District Council at Town Hall, Walliscote Grove Road, Weston–super–Mare BS23 1UJ.

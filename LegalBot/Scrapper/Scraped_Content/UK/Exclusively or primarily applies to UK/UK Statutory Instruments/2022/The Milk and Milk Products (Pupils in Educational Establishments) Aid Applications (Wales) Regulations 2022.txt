10 February 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the power contained in Article 25(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (“the CMO Regulation”), as read with Article 3(5)(c)(i)(bb) of that Regulation. They apply only in Wales.
These Regulations amend Articles 4 and 9 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/39. They amend provisions relating to documentary evidence supporting applications for aid under the scheme established by Articles 22 to 25 of the CMO Regulation. As a result of these amendments, applicants must only hold such documentary evidence available for the relevant authority. Previously, they had to submit supporting documentary evidence with the application for aid.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

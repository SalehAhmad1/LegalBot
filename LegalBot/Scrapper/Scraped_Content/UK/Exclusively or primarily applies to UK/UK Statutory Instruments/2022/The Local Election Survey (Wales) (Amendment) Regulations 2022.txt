”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Local Election Survey (Wales) Regulations 2012 (“the 2012 Regulations”).
Section 1 of the Local Government (Wales) Measure 2011 imposes a duty on a local authority (a county council or county borough council) to conduct, or to arrange for the conduct of, a survey by asking prescribed questions of candidates who are standing for election as councillors to the council of the county or county borough or to a community council in its area. Alternatively, the survey may be conducted entirely after the ordinary election, of both the successful and unsuccessful candidates.
The 2012 Regulations prescribe the questions that must be asked when conducting a survey.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations replaces the survey set out in the Schedule to the 2012 Regulations with a new survey (“the New Survey”), which makes minor amendments to the previous survey, including providing additional optional answers to certain questions and altering the wording of some questions. The New Survey also asks additional questions in relation to awareness of the Contribution towards Costs of Care and Personal Assistance, and the Access to Elected Office Fund Wales.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

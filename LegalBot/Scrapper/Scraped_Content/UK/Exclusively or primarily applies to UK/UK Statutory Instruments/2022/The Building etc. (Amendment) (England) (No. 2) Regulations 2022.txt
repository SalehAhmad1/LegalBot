paragraph RA2 of that Schedule does not apply because the case falls within regulation 44ZC(4), and

“USO-standard public electronic communications network” means a public electronic communications network that provides at least the minimum download speed for the time being specified by virtue of section 65(2B)(a) of the Communications Act 2003(4) in the universal service order (as defined by section 151(1) of that Act).
(6) The developer is to be treated as being able to secure the provision of a connection mentioned in any of paragraphs (2) to (4) for a cost not exceeding the cost cap unless—

a distribution point, or

where the person carrying out the building work (“the developer”) has no right to install gigabit-ready physical infrastructure in land in which it would have to be installed if it were to reach a distribution point, as close as is reasonably practicable to a distribution point, or
(c)
where the developer has no such right and requirement RA2 is excluded or modified by regulation 44ZC, and would be so excluded or modified even if the gigabit-ready physical infrastructure were required to reach as close as is reasonably practicable to a distribution point—
(i)
as close as is reasonably practicable to a location at which a distribution point is likely to be installed within the relevant 2-year period (a “likely future location”), or
(ii)
where there is no likely future location that is closer to the building than the closest distribution point already installed, an access point for gigabit-capable public electronic communications networks, or
(d)
where the developer has no right to install gigabit-ready physical infrastructure in land beyond the building, an access point for gigabit-capable public electronic communications networks.
(2) Where the work concerns a building containing more than one dwelling, the work must be carried out so as to ensure that the building is equipped in addition with a common access point for gigabit-capable public electronic communications networks.
(3) In this paragraph—
“distribution point” means a distribution point for a gigabit-capable public electronic communications network;
“the relevant 2-year period” means the period of 2 years beginning with the earlier of the following—

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations introduces the Schedule. Part 1 of the Schedule amends the Building Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2214), as they apply in England, so as to impose (in the new paragraphs RA1 and RA2 inserted in Schedule 1 to those Regulations by paragraph 8 of the Schedule) new requirements relating to the provision, in relation to newly built dwellings, of “gigabit-ready physical infrastructure” and a connection to a “gigabit-capable public electronic communications network” (those terms being defined in regulation 44C of those Regulations as amended by paragraph 6 of the Schedule).
Paragraph 5 of the Schedule inserts in those Regulations new regulations 44ZB and 44ZC, which modify or exclude the new requirements in certain cases.
Part 2 of the Schedule contains related amendments to the Building (Approved Inspectors etc.) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2215), as they apply in England.
Regulation 3 makes transitional provision under which the new requirements do not apply in certain cases.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector or community bodies is foreseen.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Bournemouth, Dorset during air 
displays and associated rehearsals that are scheduled to take place there from 31st August to 4th 
September 2022, inclusive. Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the 
displays and therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that 
flying should be restricted in the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(2) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(3), the Bournemouth Air Show flying 
display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr S J Maxted, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 383216.

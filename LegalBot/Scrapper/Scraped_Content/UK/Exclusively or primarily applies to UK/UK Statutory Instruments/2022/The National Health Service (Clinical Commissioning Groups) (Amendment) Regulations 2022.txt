16th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision to facilitate clinical commissioning groups (“CCGs”) in continuing to exercise their functions. It is proposed (subject to Parliamentary approval) to abolish CCGs later this year and for them to be superseded by new statutory bodies. These Regulations put in place measures to enable CCGs to continue to function effectively in the event that relevant personnel depart from CCGs prior to the establishment of their anticipated successor bodies.
The Regulations amend the National Health Service (Clinical Commissioning Groups) Regulations 2012 to reduce the minimum number of members of a CCG’s governing body, to remove certain disqualifications from holding governance positions in the context of a potentially smaller governing body, and to introduce a requirement on governing bodies to consult with a person or persons nominated by the Board before making commissioning decisions.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

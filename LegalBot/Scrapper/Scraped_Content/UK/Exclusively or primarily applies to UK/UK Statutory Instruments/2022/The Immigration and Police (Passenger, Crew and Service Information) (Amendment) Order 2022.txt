This Order amends the Immigration and Police (Passenger, Crew and Service Information) Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/5) (“the 2008 Order”).
Article 2(3) removes the sunset provision in article 1(2) of the 2008 Order.
Article 2(4), (5) and (8) amends the point in time by which information sought must be provided to the time when all passengers and crew have boarded, no further passengers or crew can do so and any requirements to seek authority to carry under a scheme made pursuant to section 22(1) of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 have been complied with (and authority to carry has not been refused).
Article 2(9) aligns the form and manner requirements for the provision of passenger and service information to the police for maritime and rail operators with that for aircraft operators.
Article 2(10) to (13) amends the Schedules to the 2008 Order to align the information that can be sought by police and immigration officers and includes the actual departure date and time of a service, where that differs from the scheduled date and time, along with notice of service cancellations, to the list of information that can be sought under Schedule 1. Schedules 2 and 3 are omitted and the headings to the two remaining Schedules are amended to make clear that they apply to both immigration officers and the police.

This Order, which comes into force on 1st July 2022, amends the Football (Offences) (Designation of Football Matches) Order 2004 (S.I. 2004/2410) (“the 2004 Order”) which designates football matches for the purposes of the Football (Offences) Act 1991 (c.19) (“the 1991 Act”). The 1991 Act introduced penalties for certain types of misconduct at designated football matches.
This Order brings within the scope of the 1991 Act association football matches in which one or both participating teams represent a club which is a member of the Football Association Women’s Super League or the Football Association Women’s Championship.
This Order also updates the reference in the 2004 Order to the Scottish Football League, to reflect the merger of the Scottish Football League and the Scottish Premier League to create the Scottish Professional Football League.

At 1.49 p.m. on 8 March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to legislation concerning the membership and procedures of NHS trusts. Paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 to the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 enables the Welsh Ministers to make provision with respect to the membership and procedures of NHS trusts in Wales.
Part 2 of these Regulations amends the National Health Service Trusts (Membership and Procedure) Regulations 1990 (S.I. 1990/2024) (“the 1990 Regulations”), which make provision concerning the membership and procedures of NHS trusts in England and Wales. The amendments make provision for the role of the vice-chair as a director on the board of an NHS trust in Wales, including with respect to tenure of office (including termination), appointment (including disqualification and eligibility for re-appointment) and the powers and role of the vice-chair in proceedings and committees of the trust. These Regulations also amend the 1990 Regulations to modify the maximum number of directors, excluding the chairman and vice-chair, permitted on the board of an NHS trust in Wales.
Part 3 of these Regulations amends the Velindre National Health Service Trust (Establishment) Order 1993 (S.I. 1993/2838) (“the 1993 Order”), which established Velindre National Health Service Trust (“Velindre”). These Regulations amend the 1993 Order to provide for a vice-chair on the board of directors of Velindre and to increase the number of executive directors.
Part 4 of these Regulations amends the Welsh Ambulance Services National Health Service Trust (Establishment) Order 1998 (S.I. 1998/678) (“the 1998 Order”), which established the Welsh Ambulance Service National Health Service Trust (“WAST”). These Regulations amend the 1998 Order to provide for a vice-chair on the board of directors of WAST and to increase the number of executive directors. The amendments also decrease the number of non-executive directors, excluding the chairman and vice-chair, to achieve parity with the 1990 Regulations.
Part 5 of these Regulations amends the Public Health Wales National Health Service Trust (Establishment) Order 2009 (S.I. 2009/2058 (W. 177)) (“the 2009 Order”), which established the Public Health Wales National Health Service Trust (“PHW”). These Regulations amend the 2009 Order to provide for a vice-chair on the board of directors of PHW and to increase the number of executive directors.
Part 6 of these Regulations amends the Public Health Wales National Health Service Trust (Membership and Procedure) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/1385 (W. 141)) (“the 2009 Regulations”), which make specific provision for the membership and procedures of PHW. The amendments make provision for the role of a vice-chair on the trust’s board of directors, including with respect to qualifications for appointment (including procedure for appointment, disqualification and eligibility for reappointment), tenure of office (including termination and suspension) and the powers and role of the vice-chair in proceedings and committees of the trust. These Regulations also amend the 2009 Regulations to modify the maximum number of directors, excluding the chair and vice-chair, permitted on the board of PHW.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Department for Health and Social Services, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

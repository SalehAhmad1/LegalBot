(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Energy Performance of Buildings (England and Wales) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/3118) (“the principal regulations”), which implemented Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings (recast) (OJ No L 153, 18 18.6.2010, p. 13). The principal regulations were made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. That Act was repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 but the principal regulations continue to have effect as retained EU law by virtue of section 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
Regulation 2 amends the fees for entering data onto the register of energy performance certificates, display energy certificates and air conditioning inspection reports kept under regulation 27 (registration of certificates etc) of the principal regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

The Secretary of State makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 64(1), 70(4), 71(6), 123(1)(a) and (d), 137(2)(a) and 175(3) and (4) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992(1), section 36(2) and (4)(a) of, and paragraph 11(2) of Schedule 1 to, the Jobseekers Act 1995(2), section 1(5)(a) of the State Pension Credit Act 2002(3), section 25(2), (3) and (5)(a) of, and paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to, the Welfare Reform Act 2007(4) and sections 4(5)(a), 42(2) and (3)(a), 77(3), 92(1) and 94(2) and (3)(a) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012(5).
In respect of the provisions relating to housing benefit, the Secretary of State has not consulted organisations appearing to be representative of the authorities concerned because it appears to the Secretary of State to be inexpedient to do so by reason of the urgency of the matter(6).
For the same reason, it appears to the Secretary of State to be inexpedient to refer the proposals to make these Regulations to the Social Security Advisory Committee(7).

Reg. 1 in force at 22.3.2022, see reg. 1(1)
(1)
The provisions being amended by Part 2 extend to England and Wales and Scotland. This instrument does not reflect the presumption that amendments will have the same extent and application as the provisions amended because the Secretary of State does not have executive competence to exercise functions, as regards Scotland, in relation to the benefits regulations amended by Part 3. The function of making regulations under sections 64(1), 70(4) and 71(6) of the Contributions and Benefits Act is exercisable by the Secretary of State by virtue of section 175(1) of that Act and the function of making regulations under section 77(3) of the 2012 Act is exercisable by the Secretary of State by virtue of section 94(1) of that Act. The functions of the Secretary of State under those provisions, as regards Scotland, transferred to the Scottish Ministers on 1st April 2020. Legislative competence for disability and carer’s benefits were transferred to the Scottish Parliament by section 22(2) of the Scotland Act 2016 (c. 11). Section 22(2) inserted an exception into reservation F1 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46) and was brought into force on 17th May 2017 by S.I. 2017/455, subject to transitional arrangements set out in S.I. 2017/444 which modified the operation of the Scotland Act 1998. Section 32 of the Scotland Act 2016 provides the meaning of “pre-commencement enactment” in this context. The transitional arrangements in respect of disability and carer’s benefits ended on 31st March 2020 (see regulation 4 of the Scotland Act 2016 (Transitional) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/444)). Accordingly, insofar as the functions under those sections of the Contributions and Benefits Act and section 77(3) of the 2012 Act are exercisable within devolved competence, they are now exercisable by the Scottish Ministers. To ensure that the provisions introduced by these Regulations operate identically across England and Wales and Scotland, the Scottish Ministers are making parallel regulations, (the Social Security (Residence Requirements) (Ukraine) (Scotland) Regulations 2022), to these Regulations, the majority of which are to come into force on 22nd March 2022.Amendment of income-related benefit legislation

Parliamentary Under Secretary of State
Department for Work and PensionsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2 of these Regulations enables certain persons to access income-related benefits upon arrival in Great Britain from Ukraine provided they meet the other relevant entitlement conditions.
That Part amends the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1967), the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/207), the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/1792), the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/213), the Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/214), the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/794) and the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376) (“the income-related benefit regulations”).
The income-related benefit regulations provide that a person is ineligible for benefit where they are a “person from abroad”, “a person not in Great Britain” (for the purposes of the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002) or “a person treated as not being in Great Britain” (for the purposes of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013)”. That is to say where the person is not habitually resident in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man or the Republic of Ireland, subject to a list of exemptions.
Regulations 2(3) and 3(3) insert a new category into the list of persons who are exempted from having to satisfy the habitual residence test. Those persons are those in Great Britain who were residing in Ukraine immediately before 1st January 2022 and left Ukraine in connection with the Russian invasion which took place on 24th February 2022 and have either been granted leave in accordance with immigration rules made under section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77) or who have a right of abode in the United Kingdom within the meaning given in section 2 of that Act.
Regulations 2(4) and 3(4) make amendments so as to provide that any person who has leave outside the immigration rules is to be treated as exempted from having to satisfy the habitual residence test. Regulations 2(2) and 3(2) make amendments which are consequential to those amendments.
Part 3 of these Regulations enables certain persons to access disability and carers benefits upon arrival in England and Wales from Ukraine where they have left Ukraine for the reasons given above, provided they meet the other relevant entitlement conditions.
That Part amends the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 (S.I. 1976/409), the Social Security (Attendance Allowance) Regulations 1991 (S.I. 1991/2740), the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991 (S.I. 1991/2890) and the Social Security (Personal Independence Payment) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/377) respectively, to exempt the same group of people from the past presence test. This is the test which normally has to be fulfilled in order to claim Carer’s Allowance, Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance and Personal Independence Payment respectively. The past presence test normally requires that an individual has been present in Great Britain for a specified period of time to be eligible for those benefits. These amendments also remove the habitual residence requirement for entitlement to disability benefits which would otherwise apply to refugees and those who have humanitarian protection or their dependants.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

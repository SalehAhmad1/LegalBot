(b)
rule 18.13 of Section II;
(c)
rule M.9 of Section III.

(b)
M only meets a payment threshold in this scheme if, in addition to meeting the criteria for that threshold, M would be entitled to payment of an ill-health pension under this scheme (disregarding this paragraph);

terms which are defined for the purpose of paragraph 29 have the same meaning as in that paragraph.”.Heather Wheeler

16th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1964) (“the 2014 Regulations”) which established the new Civil Service pension scheme known as “alpha”.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 121 of the 2014 Regulations in relation to the payment of a lump sum death benefit.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 134 of the 2014 Regulations to provide for the member contribution rates for the scheme year ending on 31st March 2022 to also apply to the 1st April 2022 to 31st March 2023 scheme year, as against the unchanged annualised rate of pensionable earnings bands.
Regulation 5 amends regulation 173 of the 2014 Regulations to bring provisions about the time when information about the payment of the annual allowance charge into line with the provisions of regulation 14A of the Registered Pension Schemes (Provision of Information) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/567).
Regulation 6 amends Schedule 1 to the 2014 Regulations to allow certain transition members to exercise an option to make a lump sum payment for added pension.
Regulation 7 amends Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations for the following purposes—
paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (9) make amendments in consequence of provision made by the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7). The amendments ensure that the existing principal civil service pension scheme established under section 1 of the Superannuation Act 1972 (c. 11) (“the PCSPS”) will be closed to future service accrual on and after 1st April 2022, and that any members currently in pensionable service under the PCSPS will, on that date, begin accruing benefits in alpha. In particular—
the definitions of “closing date” and “transition date” in paragraph 1 are amended to insert dates in respect of those terms that apply to full protection members so that provisions which refer to those terms operate as intended in respect of such members;
paragraph 3(3) is amended so that the tapered protection closing date for certain tapered protection members cannot be determined by the scheme manager to be on or after 1st April 2022;
paragraph 9(2) is amended so that protection ceases for a full protection member on the earlier of the day on which they leave pensionable service under the PCSPS, or 31st March 2022;
new paragraph 29B is inserted to ensure that members of the PCSPS who make an application for ill-health pension on or before 31st March 2022 which is not determined on or before that date receive no less generous ill-health benefits than they would have received had the application been determined on that date;
paragraphs (5) to (8) make (in reliance in particular on section 3(3)(b) of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25) retrospective amendments to paragraphs 16, 17, 25 and 26 of Schedule 2 to bring certain Fair Deal members within the scope of transitional protection.

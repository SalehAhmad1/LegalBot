(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1862) (“the GMS Contracts Regulations”) and the National Health Service (Personal Medical Services Agreements) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1879) (“the PMS Agreements Regulations”), which make provision in respect of services provided under a general medical services contract and a personal medical services agreement made pursuant to Part 4 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41). They apply in relation to England only.
The GMS Contracts Regulations are amended by regulation 2 and schedule 1, and the PMS Agreements Regulations are amended by regulation 3 and schedule 2.
The GMS Contracts Regulations and the PMS Agreements Regulations are both amended to permit the contractor to provide services remotely, outside of practice premises, if certain criteria are met, such as the use of appropriate digital or telecommunications methods. Premises from which remote services are provided will not need to be specified in the contract, meaning that they are not “practice premises”. Certain provisions have been amended to ensure the correct application of the definition of “practice premises”, now that remote services can be provided outside of practice premises, assisted by the new definitions of “remote service” and “remote consultation”.
The GMS Contracts Regulations and the PMS Agreements Regulations are both amended in respect of the disclosure of pay data where annual NHS earnings exceed a certain threshold to extend the requirement to individuals employed or engaged by a contractor or sub-contractor, including company directors and those engaged through agencies. Two corrections are made to regulation 27A of the GMS Contracts Regulations and to regulations 21A and 21B of the PMS Agreements Regulations to amend the point in time from which reasonable endeavours to amend existing sub-contracts can properly apply, and to amend a cross-reference.
The GMS Contracts Regulations and the PMS Agreements Regulations are both amended to insert new definition for “directly bookable appointment”. They are also both amended to replace the current requirement that at least 25% of a contractor’s daily appointments during core hours be available for online booking with a requirement that all of its directly bookable appointments be available for booking online, by telephone or in person.
The GMS Contracts Regulations and the PMS Agreements Regulations are both amended to update how applications to be on a contractor’s list of patients may be made, to include electronic applications.
The GMS Contracts Regulations and the PMS Agreements Regulations are both amended to remove the line “clinical domain” from the table setting out indicators no longer in the Quality and Outcomes Framework. This is because the domains listed now include indicators from the public health domain as well. This table is also amended by removing an indicator because it is being reinstated to the Quality and Outcomes Framework.
The PMS Agreements Regulations are also amended to allow electronic prescription forms to be used in relation to certain drugs.

“PART 3A
CO2 offsetting requirements from international flights and emissions reductions from the use of CORSIA eligible fuels
CHAPTER 1
Offsetting
Applicability of CO2 offsetting requirements
41A.—(1) For the period of 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021, the offsetting requirements of this Part apply to an aeroplane operator with international flights between States as defined in the ICAO document entitled “CORSIA States for Chapter 3 State Pairs”(1).
(2) This Part does not apply to a new entrant aeroplane operator for three years starting in the year when it meets the requirements in articles 21(1), or until its annual CO2 emissions exceed 0.1 per cent of total CO2 emissions from international flights in 2020, whichever occurs earlier.
(3) The Regulator must calculate the aeroplane operator’s annual offsetting requirements based on the data reported in accordance with Part 3, the applicability requirements in this article, and the application of articles 41B and 41C.
CO2 offsetting requirements
41B.—(1) The Regulator must calculate, for each of the aeroplane operators administered by it, the amount of CO2 emissions required to be offset for the period from 1st January 2021 to 31st December 2021 prior to consideration of the CORSIA eligible fuels, as follows—
where—
ORy = Aeroplane operator’s offsetting requirements in the given year y,
OE = Aeroplane operator’s CO2 emissions calculated in accordance with article 41A(3) in the given year y, and
SGFy = Sector’s Growth Factor(2) for the given year y.
(2) The Regulator must, upon calculating the offsetting requirements in a given year (ORy) of each of the aeroplane operators administered by it for the purposes of this Order, inform the aeroplane operator of its offsetting requirements by notice according to the timeline set out in Schedule 1.
Emissions reductions from the use of CORSIA eligible fuels
41C.—(1)  An aeroplane operator that intends to claim for emissions reductions from the use of CORSIA eligible fuels in a given year must compute those emissions reductions as follows—
(3) 
where—
ERy = Emissions reductions from the use of CORSIA eligible fuels in the given year y, in tonnes,
FCF = Fuel conversion factor,
MSf,y = Total mass of a neat CORSIA eligible fuel claimed in the given year y, in tonnes, as described in and required by Field 12(b) in Table 1 of Schedule 5,
LSf = Life cycle emissions value for a CORSIA eligible fuel, in gCO2e/MJ, and
LC = Baseline life cycle emissions values for aviation fuel, equal to 89 gCO2e/MJ for jet fuel and equal to 95 gCO2e/MJ for AvGas.
(2) The fuel conversion factor referred to in paragraph (1) is equal to—
(a)
3.16 (in kg CO2/kg fuel) for Jet-A fuel/Jet A1 fuel,
(b)
3.10 (in kg CO2/kg fuel) for AvGas, or
(c)
3.10 (in kg CO2/kg fuel) for Jet-B fuel.
(3) If a default life cycle emissions value is used, the aeroplane operator must use the ICAO document entitled “CORSIA Default Life Cycle Emissions Values for CORSIA Eligible Fuels”(4) for the calculation in paragraph (1).
(4) If an actual life cycle emissions value is used an approved Sustainability Certification Scheme must ensure that the methodology set out in the ICAO document entitled “CORSIA Methodology for Calculating Actual Life Cycle Emissions Values”(5) has been applied correctly.”.

(2)
The Sector’s Growth Factor applicable for a given year (SGFy) is provided in the ICAO document entitled “CORSIA Annual Sector’s Growth Factor (SGF)” that is available from the ICAO CORSIA website, and is calculated as (SEy-SEB,y)SEy, where SEy = Total sectoral CO2 emissions covered by article 41A in the given year y and SEB,y = Average of total sectoral CO2 emissions during 2019 and 2020 covered by article 41A in the given year y. Sectoral emissions in a given year (SEy) do not include the CO2 emissions from new entrants during their exception period, as defined in article 41A(2) and (3). As the States which form the “CORSIA States for Chapter 3 State Pairs”, as defined by article 41A, change over time, the average of total sectoral CO2 emissions during 2019 and 2020 covered by these State pairs in the given year y (SEB,y) will be recalculated.

Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the offsetting requirements for the 2021 scheme year of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Civil Aviation (CORSIA) in Volume IV of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation adopted by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on 27th June 2018.
This Order extends to the whole of the United Kingdom.
The following amendments are made to incorporate the offsetting requirements into the Air Navigation (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) Order 2021 (“the CORSIA Order”, S.I. 2021/534).
Article 6 amends the definitions in the CORSIA Order.
Articles 10, 19, 33 and 34 amend the references to flights that are subject to offsetting in the CORSIA Order.
Article 13(3) enables a Regulator to amend an Emissions Monitoring Plan, by notifying the aeroplane operator, where the Regulator considers it necessary following a change to the CORSIA Order. Articles 28(2) and 30 provide aeroplane operators with an appeal process.
Article 22 inserts Part 3A to the CORSIA Order to incorporate the CO2 offsetting requirements from international flights and emissions reductions from the use of CORSIA eligible fuels.
Article 31 amends Schedule 1 to the CORSIA Order to incorporate timelines associated with the offsetting requirements.
Article 32 amends Schedule 2 to the CORSIA Order to clarify the rounding requirements specific to the Average Fuel Burn Ratio (AFBR).
Article 33 amends Schedule 4 to the CORSIA Order, which covers the Emissions Monitoring Plan requirements, to amend the references to flights that are and are not subject to offsetting in the CORSIA Order.
Article 34 amends Schedule 5 to the CORSIA Order to incorporate offsetting provisions into the CORSIA reporting requirements.
Article 35 amends Schedule 6 to the CORSIA Order to incorporate offsetting provisions into the CORSIA verification requirements.
Other provisions correct errors in the CORSIA Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this Order as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside this Order on the UK legislation website, www.legislation.gov.uk.

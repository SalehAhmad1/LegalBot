5 January 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the County Borough of Wrexham (Electoral Arrangements) Order 2021 (the “2021 Order”), which implements the recommendations for changes to the electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Wrexham, as contained within the report of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales dated November 2020 (“the Report”), with modifications.
The Table in the Schedule to the 2021 Order (“the Table”) sets out the electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Wrexham. Each electoral ward comprises the areas specified in column 3 of the Table. The Report mistakenly omitted certain information in relation to the electoral ward of Marchwiel, which led to that information not appearing in column 3 of the Table. Article 2 of this Order rectifies that mistake.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

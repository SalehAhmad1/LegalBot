Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office
14th July 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
The Regulations make corrections and amendments to a number of sanctions regulations which have been made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act, namely the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/411), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/433), the South Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/438), the Iran (Sanctions) (Nuclear) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/461), the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida (United Nations Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/466), the Counter-Terrorism (International Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/573), the Counter-Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/577), the Central African Republic (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations (S.I. 2020/616), the Lebanon (Sanctions) (Assassination of Rafiq Hariri and others) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/617), the Somalia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/642), the Iraq (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/707), the Mali (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/705), the Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/753), the Afghanistan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/948), the Yemen (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1278), the Libya (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1665).
The Regulations insert a new information sharing power in each of the sanctions regulations mentioned above to authorise other government departments, agencies and relevant bodies to share information to enable or assist the Treasury to discharge its functions in connection with sanctions.
Sanctions regulations impose various obligations on “relevant firms” to report to the Treasury. The Regulations widen the definition of “relevant firm” to capture cryptoasset exchange providers and custodian wallet providers in each of the sanctions regulations mentioned above.
Regulations 6(2), 10(2), 12(2) and 15(2) make amendments to the ISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida (United Nations Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/466), the Lebanon (Sanctions) (Assassination of Rafiq Hariri and others) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/617), the Iraq (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/707) and the Afghanistan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/948), respectively, to clarify that the definition of ‘designated person’ in the Treasury licence regulation has the same meaning as in Part 3 (Finance) of the relevant Regulations.
Regulation 7(2) makes a correction in the Counter-Terrorism (International Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/573) to a cross-reference in respect of reporting obligations arising due to a transfer of funds to a ring-fenced account. Regulation 7(3) corrects a grammatical error in those regulations.
Regulation 11(2) makes an amendment to the Somalia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/642) to reflect the change in name of the African Union’s mission in Somalia from AMISOM to ATMIS as per UN Security Council Resolution 2628 (2022).
Regulation 17(2) makes a correction to regulation 43 of the Libya (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1665) to provide that, for the purposes of the partial asset-freeze provisions in those regulations, it is not a breach of financial sanctions to credit a frozen account with interest.
Regulation 17(3) makes a correction in the Libya Regulations to specify that the licence grounds available in respect of the LIA and LAIP include the purpose of satisfying prior obligations as set out in Part 2 of Schedule 4.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An impact assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions Act and can be found at:

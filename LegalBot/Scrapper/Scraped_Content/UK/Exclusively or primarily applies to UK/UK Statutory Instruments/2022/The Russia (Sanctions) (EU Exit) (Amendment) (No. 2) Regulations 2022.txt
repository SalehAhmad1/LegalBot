2018 c.5.Elizabeth Truss
Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs
Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office
at 8.10 p.m. on 28th February 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) to amend the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
The Regulations add new financial sanctions to Part 3 (Finance) of the 2019 Regulations. Existing restrictions on dealing with certain financial instruments and providing loans and credit are amended to extend the sanctions prohibitions to a broader range of transferable securities and money market instruments (regulation 16 of the 2019 Regulations); and loans and credit (regulation 17). Further restrictions on correspondent banking relationships and processing of sterling payments are also introduced (in new regulation 17A of the 2019 Regulations). The amendments also introduce a power for the Secretary of State to designate persons for the purposes of that provision.
These Regulations provide for exceptions to, and for licensing powers in relation to, those prohibitions. In particular, there is provision to make clear that a licence may authorise acts which would otherwise be prohibited by any of regulations 11 to 17A for a particular period beginning with the coming into force of the prohibition, or the date of any designation made for the purposes of those provision. This would allow a period for persons affected to arrange their affairs to comply.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector has been published alongside these Regulations and is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sanctions-on-russia, or from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, King Charles Street, London SW1A 2AH.

3rd May 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Special Constables Regulations 1965 (S.I. 1965/536), lowering the age at which an applicant can apply to become a special constable to 17. A successful applicant must still obtain the age of 18 before being appointed as a special constable. This brings the minimum age requirements in line with those applicable to those applying to become a constable under regulation 10 of the Police Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/527) (“the 2003 Regulations”).
These Regulations also make the following amendments further to section 4 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (c. 32). Section 4 enables special constables to become members of the Police Federation of England and Wales (“the Federation”).
Regulation 3 amends the 2003 Regulations to enable special constables’ attendance at some meetings of the Federation to be treated as an occasion of police duty.
Regulation 4 amends the Police Federation (England and Wales) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/1140) to allow constables to join the Federation, and sets out the requirements of the Federation to notify new special constables of their right to join the Federation and to pay a voluntary subscription to receive certain benefits associated with membership.
Regulations 5, 6 and 7 amend the Police (Complaints and Misconduct) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/2), the Police (Performance) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/3) and the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/4) respectively to enable special constables to seek advice from a representative from the Police Federation for England and Wales at proceedings under those regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary of public sectors is foreseen.

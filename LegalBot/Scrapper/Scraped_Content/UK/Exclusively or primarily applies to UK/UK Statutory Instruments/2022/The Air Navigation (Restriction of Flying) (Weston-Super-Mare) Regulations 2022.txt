EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset 
during air displays for the general public that are scheduled to take place there on 25th June 2022 
and 26th June 2022. A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during 
the displays and therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree 
that flying should be restricted in the vicinity of the displays for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2), the Weston Air Festival flying display 
director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr S J Maxted, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 383216.

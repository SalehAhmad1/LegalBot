28 June 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Council Tax (Additional Provisions for Discount Disregards) Regulations 1992 (“the Discount Disregards Regulations”) and the Council Tax (Exempt Dwellings) Order 1992 (“the Exempt Dwellings Order”) to ensure that existing disregards and exemptions are not affected as a result of individuals admitted to the United Kingdom under the UK Government’s Homes for Ukraine Scheme (“Homes for Ukraine Scheme”) residing in a property to which such disregards and exemptions apply.
Section 11 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”) provides that the amount of council tax payable in respect of a chargeable dwelling on any day will be subject to a discount equal to the appropriate percentage of that amount if on that day:
(a)
there is only one resident of a dwelling and the resident does not fall to be disregarded for the purposes of discount or there are two or more residents of the dwelling and each of them except one falls to be disregarded for the purpose of a discount; or
(b)
there is no resident of the dwelling or there are one or more residents of the dwelling and each of them falls to be disregarded for the purposes of a discount.
The appropriate percentages are 25% in relation to (a) above and 50% in relation to (b).
Schedule 1 to the 1992 Act lists the persons that are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining a discount. Regulation 5 of the Discount Disregards Regulations lists additional classes of person who are to be disregarded.
Under section 4(1) of the 1992 Act, council tax is payable in respect of dwellings which are not exempt. The Exempt Dwellings Order, made under section 4(3) of the 1992 Act, prescribes classes of dwellings which are exempt from council tax.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Discount Disregards Regulations to prescribe persons who are present in the United Kingdom under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme as an additional class of persons to be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the discount under section 11 of the 1992 Act.
Regulation 3 amends the Exempt Dwellings Order to provide that exemptions relating to occupied dwellings where individuals admitted to the United Kingdom under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme reside in such dwellings in England, also apply to dwellings in Wales. Regulation 3 also extends such exemptions to other particular dwellings in Wales.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

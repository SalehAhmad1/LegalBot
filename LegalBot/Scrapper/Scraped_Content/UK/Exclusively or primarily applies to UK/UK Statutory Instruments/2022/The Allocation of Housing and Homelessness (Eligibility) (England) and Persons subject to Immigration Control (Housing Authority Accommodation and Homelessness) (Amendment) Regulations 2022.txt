(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/1294). Those amendments ensure that certain persons in the United Kingdom who were residing in Ukraine immediately before 1st January 2022, who left Ukraine in connection with the Russian invasion which took place on 24th February 2022 and who have been granted leave in accordance with immigration rules made under section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77), are eligible for an allocation of housing accommodation and for housing assistance. The amendments also exempt persons leaving Ukraine in those circumstances who are not subject to immigration control, but are usually subject to a habitual residence test, from that test.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends the Persons subject to Immigration Control (Housing Authority Accommodation and Homelessness) Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/706). Those amendments enable housing authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland to provide housing accommodation and housing authorities in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to provide homelessness assistance to those persons referred to above.

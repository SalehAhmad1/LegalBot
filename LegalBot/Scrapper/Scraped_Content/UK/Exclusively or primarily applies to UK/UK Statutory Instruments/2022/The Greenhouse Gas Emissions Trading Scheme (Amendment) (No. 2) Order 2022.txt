26.  After Article 5 insert—
“Article 5a
2022 activity level changes: average activity level based on 2019 and 2021 years
1.  The operator of an installation may apply for a determination by the UK ETS authority that a sub-installation of the installation meets the Covid condition referred to in Article 5b if, on submission of the 2022 activity level report under Article 3, Article 5(1), (2) or (3) requires (apart from this Article) an adjustment to decrease free allocation of allowances in respect of the sub-installation for the 2022 and subsequent scheme years.
2.  But an application may not be made if the regulator made an estimate of the value of a parameter under Article 3(4)(a) because the operator did not submit the 2021 activity level report or the 2022 activity level report on or before the date referred to in Article 3(3).
3.  An application must be made to the regulator on or before 31 January 2023 or such later date as the regulator may specify if, in a case where the operator requests an extension of time on or before 31 January 2023, the regulator considers that the reason for the request is reasonable.
4.  An application must be accompanied by:
(a)
either:
(i)
a report identifying the quantity of emissions attributable to the sub-installation in 2019 and in 2020, determined in accordance with the methodology in the monitoring methodology plan and verified as satisfactory in accordance with the Verification Regulation 2018(1) as if the data in the report formed part of a baseline data report; or
(ii)
where the data referred to in subpoint (i) are included in the 2021 activity level report, a statement by the verifier that the verification of the report included the verification of those data; and
(b)
evidence that the sub-installation meets point (c) of the Covid condition set out in Article 5b(2), including an explanation why, when comparing 2020 to 2019 levels, the emissions attributable to the sub-installation did not fall by at least the same proportion as its activity level.
5.  After receiving an application, the regulator must, as soon as reasonably practicable:
(a)
assess whether or not the sub-installation meets the Covid condition; and
(b)
send the assessment and the reasons for it to the UK ETS authority.
6.  After receiving the assessment, the UK ETS authority must determine whether or not the sub-installation meets the Covid condition.
7.  If the UK ETS authority determines that the sub-installation meets the Covid condition:
(a)
this Regulation applies as if the regulator were required to determine the 2022 average activity level (that is to say, the average activity level of the sub-installation to be determined under Article 4 on submission of the 2022 activity level report) based on the activity levels of the sub-installation in 2019 and 2021 (and not on those in 2020 and 2021); or
(b)
if, before the UK ETS authority determines that the sub-installation meets the Covid condition, the 2022 average activity level based on the activity levels of the sub-installation in 2020 and 2021 is determined by the regulator under Article 4, and an adjustment to free allocation in respect of the sub-installation is approved by the UK ETS authority based on the 2022 average activity level so determined:
(i)
the regulator must re-determine the 2022 average activity level based on the activity levels of the sub-installation in 2019 and 2021; and
(ii)
this Regulation applies on the basis of that re-determination (ignoring the first determination of the 2022 average activity level and subsequent approval).
8.  If the UK ETS authority determines that the sub-installation does not meet the Covid condition:
(a)
the UK ETS authority must inform the regulator; and
(b)
the regulator must inform the operator.
9.  In this Article:
(a)
“2021 activity level report” means the activity level report (on activity levels in 2019 and 2020) due on or before 30 June 2021;
(b)
“2022 activity level report” means the activity level report (on activity levels in 2021) due on or before 31 March 2022.
Article 5b
2022 activity level changes: Covid condition
1.  This Article has effect for the purposes of Article 5a.
2.  A sub-installation of an installation meets the Covid condition if:
(a)
AL 2020 is less than AL 2019;
(b)
(AL 2019-AL 2020)/AL 2019 – (E 2019-E 2020)/E 2019 is greater than or equal to 0.15; and
(c)
the reason for the matters referred to in points (a) and (b) is wholly or mainly due to the effects of the coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic.
3.  In paragraph 2:
(a)
AL 2019 is the activity level of the sub-installation in 2019;
(b)
AL 2020 is the activity level of the sub-installation in 2020;
(c)
E 2019 is the emissions attributable to the sub-installation in 2019;

Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (the “UK ETS”) was established by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 (the “UK ETS Order”). The UK ETS runs for ten “scheme years” beginning with 2021, split into two five-year “allocation periods”. Operators of certain industrial installations and certain aircraft operators are required to monitor, submit verified reports on, and surrender “allowances” equivalent to, their greenhouse gas emissions in each scheme year. Allowances (which are tradable) are held in accounts in the UK ETS registry, and there is a cap on the number of allowances. Allowances are sold at auction, but some operators of installations and aircraft operators receive an allocation of allowances free of charge. Free allocation for installations may change from year to year depending on the installation’s activity level. For installations that meet the eligibility criteria, there are two opt-out schemes, one for “hospital or small emitters”, the other for “ultra-small emitters”.
This Order amends the UK ETS Order, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 (the “Free Allocation Regulation”) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1842 (the “Activity Level Changes Regulation”). Articles 24 and 25 of the UK ETS Order provide that Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 (the “Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018”) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067 (the “Verification Regulation 2018”) have effect for the purposes of the UK ETS, with modifications, and this Order also makes further modifications.
The main changes made by this Order are as follows. Where necessary for free allocation for installations, allowances may be created from the flexible share (40,984,970 allowances) in addition to the annual cap (see amendment to article 20 of the UK ETS Order).
New values for the global warming potentials (in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent) of certain greenhouse gases covered by the UK ETS are adopted for the 2023 and subsequent scheme years (see new paragraph 38B of Schedule 4 to the UK ETS Order).
From 1 July 2024, verifiers of emission reports must be accredited to a new standard. New applicants for accreditation as verifiers must satisfy the new standard immediately, but until 30 June 2024 the verification opinions of verifiers accredited to either the old or the new standard may be accepted (see amendments to paragraphs 4(b) and 5 and substituted paragraphs 37 and 55 of Schedule 5 to the UK ETS Order).
Verifiers of aircraft operators’ emission reports may, with the approval of the regulator, carry out “virtual” site visits whether or not force majeure prevents a physical site visit (see amendments to paragraph 24 of Schedule 5 to the UK ETS Order).
Hospital or small emitters for the 2021-2025 allocation period may voluntarily exit the opt-out scheme and join the main scheme for the 2024 and 2025 scheme years (see new paragraph 23A of Schedule 7, and amendments to paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedule 8A, to the UK ETS Order).
Where a “new entrant” installation to the UK ETS is an “electricity generator”, an application for free allocation in respect of measurable heat produced by means of high-efficiency cogeneration may not be made unless the installation has been operating (and has demonstrated the energy savings required for eligibility) for a full calendar year (see amendment to Article 5 of the Free Allocation Regulation).
The decision about whether free allocation for installations should be adjusted as part of the activity level changes process where questions of energy efficiency arise under Article 6(1) or (2) of the Activity Level Changes Regulation will be made by the UK ETS authority, rather than the regulator (see amendments to Article 6a of the Activity Level Changes Regulation).
For free allocation for the 2022 scheme year, operators of installations whose allocations would otherwise be reduced by the activity level changes process may apply for average activity levels (on which changes to free allocation are based) to be determined by reference to activity levels in 2019 and 2021 instead of those in 2020 and 2021 (see new Articles 5a and 5b of the Activity Level Changes Regulation). Where such an application is made, the regulator may withhold free allocation for the 2023 scheme year until the application is determined (see amendment to article 34W of the UK ETS Order).
Information about accounts held in the UK ETS registry (including details of emissions recorded in accounts and allowances surrendered), transfers of allowances between accounts and emissions of installations in the hospital and small emitters opt-out scheme is required to be published (see new paragraphs 31 to 34 of Schedule 5A, and new paragraph 22A of Schedule 7, to the UK ETS Order). Other scheme information may also be published (see new article 75BA of the UK ETS Order).
In addition, this Order makes other minor amendments to provide further for the process for apportioning free allocation between transferring and new operators in the case of mergers or splits of installations; to clarify, and remove duplicate or unnecessary requirements from, the permitting regime for installations; to modify further the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018 and the Verification Regulation 2018 to make corrections to, or remove unnecessary wording from, the original text; to provide for when an emission factor of zero may be claimed for tallow used at an installation; and to clarify when an emission factor of zero may be claimed for aviation biofuel. This Order also corrects an incorrect cross-reference in paragraph 4(3) of Schedule 8A to the UK ETS Order and amends Article 26 of the Free Allocation Regulation to provide correctly for the scheme year in which free allocation ceases where an installation ceases to operate.
A regulatory impact assessment of the effect that the UK ETS will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Industrial Energy Directorate, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0ET and is available alongside the UK ETS Order on www.legislation.gov.uk.

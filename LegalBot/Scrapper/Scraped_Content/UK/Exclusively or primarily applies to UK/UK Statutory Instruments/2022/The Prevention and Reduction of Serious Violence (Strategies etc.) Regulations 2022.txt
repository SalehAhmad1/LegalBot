(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision relating to the duty on certain public authorities to collaborate to prevent and reduce serious violence, provided for by Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (c. 32) (“the 2022 Act”), and to formulate and implement strategies to prevent and reduce serious violence, provided for by sections 5 to 7 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (c. 37) (“the 1998 Act”), in their local area.
Part 2 of these Regulations provides for the publication and dissemination of a serious violence strategy, under section 8 or 9 of the 2022 Act, including revised strategies. Regulation 3 provides that each strategy must be published as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been prepared, with the first section 8 strategy being published by 31st January 2024. Regulations 4 and 5 provide that each strategy must be placed on the website of a specified authority or a local policing body for the local government area (or each local government area, as the case may be) to which it relates and published in such other form as the specified authorities consider appropriate. The serious violence strategies must be submitted to the Secretary of State within 7 days (starting with the date of publication). For strategies relating to local government areas in Wales (in all or in part) the strategy must be published in both English and Welsh and submitted to Welsh Ministers as well as the Secretary of State.
Part 3 of these Regulations confers functions on local policing bodies for a police area (the Police and Crime Commissioner, Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime and the Common Council of the City of London, as the case may be) to enable them to assist a specified authority in relation to their functions under the 2022 Act in preventing and reducing serious violence. Regulations 7 to 10 enable the local policing body to, for the purpose of assisting the specified authority in the exercise of its functions under section 8 or 9 of the 2022 Act, make grants to specified authorities, convene and chair meetings, require representatives of the specified authorities, relevant authorities (educational, prison or youth custody authorities) or such other persons as they consider appropriate to attend such meetings, and provide administrative and management support to the specified authority.
Part 4 of these Regulations makes amendments to relevant secondary legislation to take into account the requirement, inserted into the 1998 Act by section 20 of the 2022 Act, for responsible authorities (members of a Community Safety Partnership) to formulate and implement a strategy to prevent and reduce serious violence. Regulation 11 amends the Crime and Disorder (Formulation and Implementation of Strategy) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/1830) which apply to England. Regulation 12 amends the Crime and Disorder (Formulation and Implementation of Strategy) (Wales) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/3076) which apply to Wales.

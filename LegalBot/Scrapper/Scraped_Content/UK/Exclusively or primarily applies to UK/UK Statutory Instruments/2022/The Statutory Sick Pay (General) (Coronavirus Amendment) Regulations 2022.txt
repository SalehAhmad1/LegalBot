(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2(2), (3) and (4) of these Regulations revokes the provisions within the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982 which deem people to be incapable of work where they are unable to work either due to isolating themselves in such a manner as to prevent infection or contamination with coronavirus, or due to shielding themselves in such a manner as to prevent infection or contamination with coronavirus.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument due to the need to make and lay the instrument urgently to align with the expiry of the Coronavirus Act.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products with regard to organic production, labelling and control (EUR 2008/889). They specify exemptions to organic production rules.
Regulation 2(2) of this instrument amends Article 42(b) of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 so as to provide that until 31st December 2022, non-organically reared pullets of not more than 18 weeks may be introduced into an organic flock for egg production when organically-reared pullets are not available, subject to conditions.
The table in Section A of Annex 8 of Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 lists food additives which may be used in the processing of organic food, subject to conditions and restrictions. Regulation 2(3) amends the entry relating to E418, gellan gum: from 1st January 2023, only organically-produced gum, in its high-acyl form, may be used in processing organic food.
A regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order designates as restricted areas for the purposes of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973 (“the Act”): the area within 75 metres of one wreck and 50 metres of another wreck in the Needles Channel, Isle of Wight; and the area within 50 metres of a wreck in the Swash Channel on the approach to Poole Harbour, Dorset.
Additionally, this Order newly designates for the purposes of the Act, an area within 150 metres of a wreck in the Hanover Cove on the North Cornish coast. This relocates and decreases the size of the restricted area, thereby better reflecting the extent of the wreck’s surviving physical remains. As a result, this Order revokes the Protection of Wrecks Designation (No. 3 Order) 1997.
Further, this Order amends a prior designation of a wreck in Bracklesham Bay, West Sussex to correct a factual error in the co-ordinates provided in the Protection of Wrecks (Designation) (England) (No. 2) Order 2017. In respect of this wreck, consultation was undertaken prior to designation in 2017, but not prior to this Order as protecting this wreck from unauthorised activity is considered to be a matter of immediate urgency.
These areas are believed to be the wreck sites of: a 17th century armed vessel known as the Shingles Bank Wreck NW68, located off the Isle of Wight; a late 15th or 16th century merchant vessel known as the Shingles Bank Wreck NW96, also located off the Isle of Wight; a 13th century cargo vessel located in Poole Bay, known as the Mortar Wreck; an 18th century English brigantine located in Hanover Cove, Cornwall, known as the Hanover; and a 17th century British third rate ship of the line, located in Bracklesham Bay, West Sussex, known as the Hazardous.
The Secretary of State is satisfied that these sites are, or may prove to be, the sites of vessels wrecked on or in the sea bed, and ought to be protected from unauthorised interference because of the historical and archaeological importance of the vessels, or of the objects contained or formerly contained in the vessels which may be lying on the sea bed in or near the wreck.
Under section 1(3) of the Act, it is a criminal offence for a person to engage in certain activities in a restricted area, except under the authority of a licence issued by the Secretary of State.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sectors.

These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Royal Air Force Cosford, 
Shropshire during air displays that are scheduled to take place there between 10th June 2022 and 
12th June 2022 (inclusive). A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres

The times mentioned in regulation 3(2) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(3)(a), the Cosford Air Show flying display 
director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr S. J. Maxted, Airspace Regulator,

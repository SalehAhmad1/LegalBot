(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”) to remove provisions which were inserted into those Regulations for the purposes of preventing, detecting and controlling the spread of infections, specifically in response to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
Those provisions required a registered person (“A”) in respect of the regulated activity of providing residential accommodation together with nursing or personal care in a care home, to secure that a person (“B”) did not enter any premises used by A unless B met specific requirements relating to vaccination against coronavirus, as well as to have related governance arrangements in place. The provisions were inserted by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) (Amendment) (Coronavirus) Regulations 2021 (“the 2021 Regulations”) and amended by regulation 3 of the Health and Social Care Act (Regulated Activities) (Amendment) (Coronavirus) (No. 2) Regulations 2022 (“the 2022 Regulations”).
Further amendments were to be made to the 2014 Regulations, which were to take effect from 1st April 2022, by regulation 4 of the 2022 Regulations. That provision, together with the remaining provisions of the 2022 Regulations, is revoked by these Regulations.
The 2021 Regulations are also revoked by these Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

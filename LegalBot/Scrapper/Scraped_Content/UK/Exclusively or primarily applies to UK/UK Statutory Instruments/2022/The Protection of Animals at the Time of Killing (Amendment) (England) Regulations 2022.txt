At 2.14 p.m. on 13th January 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 4(2) and 24a(8) of retained Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 on the protection of animals at the time of killing (EUR 2009/1099) (the “PATOK Regulation”). Under Article 4(2), the appropriate authority may amend Annex 1 to the PATOK Regulation to take account of scientific and technical progress. In relation to England, “the appropriate authority” is defined by Article 2a(1)(a) as the Secretary of State.
These Regulations amend, in relation to England, Annex 1 to the PATOK Regulation in order to permit, subject to certain criteria, the use of a non-penetrative captive bolt to kill, for slaughter, depopulation and other situations, piglets of less than 10kg live weight, lambs of less than 6kg live weight and kids of less than 4kg live weight. The use of a non-penetrative captive bolt device as a stunning method which does not result in instantaneous death (referred to as “simple stunning”), continues to be permitted for the categories of animals permitted prior to the coming into force of the Regulations. These Regulations amend Annex 1 to allow this device also to be used for the simple stunning, for depopulation and other situations, of lambs of less than 10kg live weight and kids of less than 10kg live weight. These Regulations also make consequential amendments to related additional requirements in Schedules 1 and 2 to the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1782), breach of which is an offence under regulation 30(1)(c) or (d) of those Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact, or no significant impact, on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

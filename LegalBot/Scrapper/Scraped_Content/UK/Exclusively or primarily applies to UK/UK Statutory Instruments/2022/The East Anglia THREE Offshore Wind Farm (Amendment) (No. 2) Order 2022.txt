(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the East Anglia THREE Offshore Wind Farm Order 2017 (as amended), a development consent order under the Planning Act 2008, following an application made in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Changes to, and Revocation of, Development Consent Orders) Regulations 2011 for a non-material change under paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to the Planning Act 2008. This Order inserts paragraph 38 in Part 3 of Schedule 1 which provides guidance and mitigation on the erection of primary surveillance radar at Cromer following consultation feedback. This amendment was not included in the Order made by the Secretary of State on 30th September 2022. This Order also deletes article 4(d) of the East Anglia THREE Offshore Wind Farm (Amendment) Order 2022 which appeared in error and purported to amend a reference which had already been removed as the result of a previous variation.

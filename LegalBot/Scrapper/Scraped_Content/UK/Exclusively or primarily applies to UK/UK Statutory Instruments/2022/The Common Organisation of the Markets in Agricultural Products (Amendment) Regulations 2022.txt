(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2, Chapter 1 and Part 3, Chapter 1 of these Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 8(1) and 8C(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained direct EU legislation to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular paragraphs (a), (ea) and (g) of section 8(2)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and to deal with matters arising out of, or related to, the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the EU withdrawal agreement.
Part 2, Chapter 2 and Part 3, Chapter 2 of these Regulations make amendments consequential to those made by Part 3 of Schedule 7 to the Agriculture Act 2020 (c. 21). The consequential amendments relate to marketing standards and are made to both retained direct EU legislation and EU derived domestic legislation. These amendments either omit cross references to articles of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 (EUR 2013/1308) (the CMO Regulation) which have been disapplied by Part 3 of Schedule 7 to the Agriculture Act 2020, in some cases together with associated wording, or operate to substitute references to articles of the CMO Regulation with an appropriate reference to retained EU legislation or to the Agriculture Act 2020.
The retained direct minor EU legislation made by the European Commission under Section 1 or Section 3 of Chapter 1 of Title 2 of the CMO Regulation continues to apply to products marketed in England, notwithstanding the amendments made by Part 3 of Schedule 7 to the Agriculture Act 2020.

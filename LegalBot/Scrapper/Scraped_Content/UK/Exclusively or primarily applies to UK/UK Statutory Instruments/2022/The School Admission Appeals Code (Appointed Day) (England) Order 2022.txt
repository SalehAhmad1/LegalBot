21st September 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order appoints 1st October 2022 as the day on which the School Admission Appeals Code (“the Appeals Code”) comes into force.
The Appeals Code replaces the previous School Admission Appeals Code, which came into force on 1st February 2012 (“the School Admission Appeals Code 2012”), subject to the savings in article 3.
The Appeals Code imposes requirements and includes guidelines setting out aims, objectives and other matters in relation to the arrangements for appeals against decisions to refuse admission to a maintained school and for appeals by governing bodies, pursuant to sections 94 and 95 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (c. 31) respectively.
The Appeals Code introduces:
on a permanent basis, the ability to hold appeal hearings remotely (by video conference and in some circumstances by telephone) as well as in person. The flexibility to hold appeal hearings remotely was temporarily introduced in April 2020, via the School Admissions (England) (Coronavirus) (Appeals Arrangements) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/446), as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;
hybrid appeal hearings, where one or more participants attend in person while one or more participants attend remotely.
Article 3 of this Order saves the School Admission Appeals Code 2012 in relation to appeals lodged before the Appeals Code comes into force.

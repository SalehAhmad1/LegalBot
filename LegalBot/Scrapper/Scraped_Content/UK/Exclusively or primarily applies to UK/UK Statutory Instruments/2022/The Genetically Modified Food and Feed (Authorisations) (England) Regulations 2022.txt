(b)
Schedule 2 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MZIR098;
(c)
Schedule 3 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 87427 × MON 89034 × MIR162 × NK603 and its sub-combinations;
(d)
Schedule 4 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 87427 × MON 89034 × MIR162 × MON 87411 and the sub-combinations that are not authorised by Schedule 3;
(e)
Schedule 5 is a new authorisation for genetically modified soybean MON 87751 × MON 87701 × MON 87708 × MON 89788;

Schedule 7 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 87427 × MON 87460 × MON 89034 × MIR162 × NK603 and the sub-combinations that are not authorised by Schedule 3;
(h)
Schedule 8 renews the authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 88017;
(i)
Schedule 9 renews the authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 89034.
Authorisations granted by these Regulations are valid for a period of ten years in accordance with Articles 7(4) and 19(4) of Regulation 1829/2003 and will expire at the end of 19th May 2032. This is subject to Articles 11(4) and 23(4) of that Regulation, which provide for an extension of the authorisation period in certain circumstances where an application for renewal has been submitted.
Paragraphs (a) to (d) of regulation 4 revoke, in relation to England, retained EU Decisions that contain the previous authorisations (which have expired) for the products now authorised by Schedules 1, 6, 8 and 9.
Paragraph (e) of regulation 4 revokes, in relation to England, Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1111 authorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified maize MON 87427 × MON 89034 × NK603 (MON-87427-7 × MON-89Ø34-3 × MON-ØØ6Ø3-6) and genetically modified maize combining two of the events MON 87427, MON 89034 and NK603 and repealing Decision (EU) 2010/420/EU which contained the authorisation for four of the sub-combinations of the product now authorised by Schedule 3.
Information on the authorisation of the products will be entered in the register of genetically modified food and feed referred to in Article 28(1) of Regulation 1829/2003.
The authorisations made by this instrument will be notified through the Biosafety Clearing-House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity (“the Cartagena Protocol”), pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(1)(e) of Regulation (EC) No. 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms.
Further information, including in relation to the monitoring plans, the register, or the information notified pursuant to the Cartagena Protocol, can be obtained from the Food Standards Agency, Floors 6 and 7, Clive House, 70 Petty France, London, SW1H 9EX or by writing to GM.Inquiries@food.gov.uk.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

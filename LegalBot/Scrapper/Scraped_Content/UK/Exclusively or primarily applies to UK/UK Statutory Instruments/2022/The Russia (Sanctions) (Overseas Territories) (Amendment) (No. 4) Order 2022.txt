(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes amendments to the Russia (Sanctions) (Overseas Territories) Order 2020 (S.I. 2020/1571) (“the Principal Order”).
The Principal Order extends with modifications the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the Russia sanctions regulations”) as amended from time to time to all British overseas territories except Bermuda and Gibraltar (which implement sanctions under their own legislative arrangements). The Russia sanctions regulations established a sanctions regime in relation to Russia for the purpose of encouraging Russia to cease actions destabilising Ukraine or undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty or independence of Ukraine.
The Russia sanctions regulations have recently been amended by the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 15) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1110) and the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 16) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1122) (“the amending regulations”) which made a number of changes, including:
creating new trade prohibitions relating to gold jewellery and to certain processed gold, together with related definitions, exceptions and consequential amendments;
making provision concerning the prohibition of imports of liquefied natural gas and the export of Russia’s vulnerable goods (as defined in the amending regulations);
creating new prohibitions concerning the supply and delivery by ship of certain oil and oil products (“the new prohibitions”) and the provision of related ancillary services;
creating exceptions from the new prohibitions and for Treasury licences allowing maritime transportation of oil and oil products to take place notwithstanding the new prohibitions;
allowing for the issue of monetary penalties for breaches of the new prohibitions.
This Order makes the necessary amendments to the Principal Order to give effect in the relevant British overseas territories to the changes made to the Russia sanctions regime by the amending regulations.
An Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this Order: the territorial extent of both this Order and the Principal Order is the British overseas territories listed in the Schedule to this Order and no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sector in the United Kingdom.

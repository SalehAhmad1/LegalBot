2 March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the retained EU law that establishes marketing standards for eggs. They apply in relation to Wales.
They amend retained Commission Regulation (EC) No 589/2008 (EUR 2008/589) on marketing standards for eggs, by permitting marketing standards checks on Class A eggs to take place at locations such as packing centres and wholesalers’ premises, but before sale to the final consumer or to mass caterers, rather than requiring the checks to be carried out before customs clearance.
The Welsh Minister’s Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely cost and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

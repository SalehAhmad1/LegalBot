the standard of maintenance appropriate for a highway of that character and used by such traffic;

(e)
where the Council could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the new highway before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the Council had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the new highway to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the Council had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the new highway and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.

(2) In assessing the compensation payable to any person in respect of the acquisition from that person of any new rights over land (including the subsoil) under article 17 (power to acquire new rights), the tribunal must set off against the value of the rights so acquired—
(a)
any increase in the value of the land over which the new rights are required; and

which will accrue to such person by reason of the construction of any part of the development.

(3) The exercise by the Council or Network Rail or by the Council and Network Rail jointly, of any powers and rights under any enactment or contract pursuant to any such agreement as is authorised by paragraph (1) is subject to all statutory and contractual provisions relating to it as would apply if such powers and rights were exercised by the Council or Network Rail (as the case may be) alone, and accordingly such provisions, with any necessary modifications, apply to the exercise of such powers and rights by the Council or Network Rail or by the Council and Network Rail jointly, as the case may be.
(4) The Council and Network Rail may enter into, and carry into effect, agreements for the transfer to and vesting in Network Rail or the Council, or the Council and Network Rail jointly of—

(b)
that the nuisance is a consequence of the construction, operation or maintenance of the development and that it cannot reasonably be avoided.
(2) Section 61(9) (consent for work on construction site to include statement that it does not of itself constitute a defence to proceedings under section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, does not apply where the consent relates to the use of premises by the Council or Network Rail for the purposes of or in connection with the construction or maintenance of the development.
(3) In proceedings for an offence under section 80(4) (summary proceedings for statutory nuisances) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in respect of a statutory nuisance falling within section 79(1)(g) or 79(1)(ga) of that Act where the offence consists of contravening requirements imposed by virtue of section 80(1)(a) or (b)(4) of that Act, it is a defence to show that the nuisance—

MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modification as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the following modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date)(1) of the 1961 Act, substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enter on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 6 to the Northumberland Line Order 2022 (“the 2022 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 6 to the 2022 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enter on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection 3(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(2) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph 2(2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection)(3), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right over land”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 15 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 14 (power to acquire land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of rights under article 17 (power to acquire new rights)—
(a)
with the modification specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in the case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (refusal to convey, failure to make title, etc.);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (persons without power to sell their interests);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 14 (power to acquire land)), it has power, exercisable in the equivalent circumstances and subject to the equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry)(4), 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date)(5), 12 (unauthorised entry)(6) and 13 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority)(7) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 (tenants at will etc.)(8) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 15(7) (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, the whole or part of a house, building or factory.
(2) But see article 18 (power to acquire subsoil or airspace only) of the Northumberland Line Order 2022, which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of its decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the proposed use of the right to be acquired, and
(c)
if the right is proposed to be acquired for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the Council, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(6) An amount which, apart from this sub-paragraph, would be payable to a statutory utility in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) (and having regard, where relevant, to sub-paragraph (4)) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on the statutory utility any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(7) Sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) do not apply where the development constitutes major transport works or major highway works for the purposes of Part 3 of the 1991 Act, but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of cost of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being have effect under that section; and
(b)
the allowable costs are to be borne by the Council and the statutory utility in such proportions as may be prescribed by any such regulations.
(8) In this paragraph—
“apparatus” has the same meaning as in Part 3 of the 1991 Act;
“relocation works” means work executed, or apparatus provided, under sub-paragraph (2); and
“statutory utility” means a statutory undertaker for the purposes of the 1980 Act or a public communications provider as defined in paragraph 1(6).

and the Council must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or any such failure, act or omission: and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the Council or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision does not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the Council from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Network Rail must give the Council reasonable written notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand will be made without the prior consent of the Council.
(3) The sums payable by the Council under sub-paragraph (1) will if relevant include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs.
(4) Subject to the terms of any agreement between Network Rail and a train operator regarding the timing or method of payment of the relevant costs in respect of that train operator, Network Rail must promptly pay to each train operator the amount of any sums which Network Rail receives under sub-paragraph (3) which relates to the relevant costs of that train operator.
(5) The obligation under sub-paragraph (3) to pay Network Rail the relevant costs will, in the event of default, be enforceable directly by any train operator concerned to the extent that such sums would be payable to that operator pursuant to sub-paragraph (4).

supply the engineer with all such information as the engineer may reasonably require with regard to a specified work or protective work or the method of constructing it.
32.  Nexus must at all reasonable times afford reasonable facilities to the Council and the Council’s agents for access to any works carried out by Nexus under this Part of this Schedule during their construction and must supply the Council with such information as the Council may reasonably require with regard to such works or the method of constructing them.
33.—(1) If any permanent or temporary alterations or additions to railway property, are reasonably necessary in consequence of the construction of a specified work or a protective work, or during a period of 24 months after the completion of that work in order to ensure the safety of railway property or the continued safe operation of the railway of Nexus, such alterations and additions may be carried out by Nexus and if Nexus gives to the Council reasonable notice of its intention to carry out such alterations or additions (which must be specified in the notice), the Council must pay to Nexus the reasonable cost of those alterations or additions including, in respect of any such alterations and additions as are to be permanent, a capitalised sum representing the increase of the costs which may be expected to be reasonably incurred by Nexus in maintaining, working and, when necessary, renewing any such alterations or additions.
(2) If during the construction of a specified work or a protective work by the Council, Nexus gives notice to the Council that Nexus desires itself to construct that part of the specified work or protective work which in the opinion of the engineer is endangering the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Nexus then, if the Council decides that part of the specified work or protective work is to be constructed, Nexus must assume construction of that part of the specified work or protective work and the Council must, regardless of any such approval of a specified work or protective work under paragraph 29(3), pay to Nexus all reasonable expenses to which Nexus may be put and compensation for any loss which it may suffer by reason of the execution by Nexus of that specified work or protective work.
(3) If the cost of maintaining, working or renewing railway property is reduced in consequence of any such alterations or additions a capitalised sum representing such saving is to be set off against any sum payable by the Council to Nexus under this paragraph.
(4) The engineer must, in respect of the capitalised sums referred to in this paragraph and paragraph 34(a) provide such details of the formula by which those sums have been calculated as the Council may reasonably require.
34.  The Council must repay to Nexus all reasonable fees, costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred by Nexus—
(a)
in constructing any part of a specified work on behalf of the Council as provided by paragraph 29(3) or in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 29(4) including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the Council and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work or a protective work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signallers, watchkeepers and other persons whom it is reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer, require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work or from the substitution of diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work.
35.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Nexus apparatus generated by the operation of the development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Nexus’s apparatus; and
“Nexus’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the development) which are owned or used by Nexus for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Nexus’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 29(1) for the relevant part of the development giving rise to EMI (unless the Council has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the Council must in the design and construction of the development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Nexus (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the Council’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the Council must consult with Nexus as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Nexus’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and must continue to consult with Nexus (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 29(1)) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Nexus must make available to the Council all information in the possession of Nexus reasonably requested by the Council in respect of Nexus’s apparatus identified under sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Nexus must allow the Council reasonable facilities for the inspection of Nexus’s apparatus identified under sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Nexus’s apparatus, Nexus must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Nexus’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution may be selected at the reasonable discretion of Nexus, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 29(1) has effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) If at any time prior to the completion of the development and regardless of any measures adopted under sub-paragraph (3), the testing or commissioning of the development causes EMI then the Council must immediately upon receipt of notification by Nexus of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the Council’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Nexus’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the Council must afford reasonable facilities to Nexus for access to the Council’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Nexus must afford reasonable facilities to the Council for access to Nexus’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI; and
(c)
Nexus must make available to the Council any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the Council in respect of Nexus’s apparatus or such EMI.
(8) Where Nexus approves modifications to Nexus’s apparatus under sub-paragraphs (5) or (6)—
(a)
Nexus must allow the Council reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Nexus’s apparatus; and
(b)
any modifications to Nexus’s apparatus approved under those sub-paragraphs must be carried out and completed by the Council in accordance with paragraph 30.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 39(1) applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses suffered by Nexus through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Nexus’s apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which sub-paragraph (6) applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 34(a) any modifications to Nexus’s apparatus under this paragraph are deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
(11) In relation to any dispute arising under this paragraph the reference in article 366 (arbitration) to a single arbitrator to be agreed between the parties is to be read as a reference to an arbitrator being a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology to be agreed.
36.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work or a protective work, not being a work vested in Nexus, Nexus gives notice to the Council informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work or protective work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the Council must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work or protective work in such state of maintenance as to not adversely affect railway property.
37.  The Council must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work or a protective work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Nexus unless the Council has first consulted Nexus and the Council must comply with Nexus’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.
38.  Any additional expenses which Nexus may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work or a protective work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the Council, be repaid by the Council to Nexus.
39.—(1) The Council must pay to Nexus all reasonable costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part of this Schedule which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Nexus—
(a)
by reason of the construction or maintenance of a specified work or a protective work or the failure of it; or
(b)
by reason of any act or omission of the Council or of any person in the Council’s employ or of the Council’s contractors or others whilst engaged upon a specified work or a protective work,
and the Council must indemnify and keep indemnified Nexus from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or a protective work or any such failure, act or omission; and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Nexus on behalf of the Council or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision will not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Nexus or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the Council from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Nexus must give the Council reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand is to be made without the prior written consent of the Council.
(3) The sums payable by the Council under sub-paragraph (1) may include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs.
40.  Nexus must, on receipt of a request from the Council, at a frequency to be agreed between the Council and Nexus, provide the Council free of charge with written estimates of the costs, charges, expenses, future cost forecasts and other liabilities for which the Council is or will become liable under this Part of this Schedule (including the amount of the relevant costs mentioned in paragraph 39) and with such information as may reasonably enable the Council to assess the reasonableness of any such estimate or claim made or to be made under this Part of this Schedule (including any claim relating to those relevant costs).
41.  In the assessment of any sums payable to Nexus under this Part of this Schedule there must not be taken into account any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken by or any agreement entered into by Nexus if that action or agreement was not reasonably necessary and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the Council under this Part of this Schedule or increasing the sums so payable.
42.  The Council and Nexus may enter into, and carry into effect, agreements for the transfer to the Council of—
(a)
any railway property shown on the works plans or land plans and described in the book of reference;
(b)
any lands, works or other property held in connection with any such railway property; and
(c)
any rights and obligations (whether or not statutory) of Nexus relating to any railway property or any lands, works or other property referred to in this paragraph.
43.  Nothing in this Order, or in any enactment incorporated with or applied by this Order, prejudices or affects the operation of Part 1 of the Railways Act 1993.
44.  The Council must give written notice to Nexus where any application is required and is proposed to be made for the Secretary of State’s consent under article 27 (power to transfer benefit of the Order) and any such notice must be given no later than 28 days before any such application is made and must describe or give (as appropriate)—
(a)
the nature of the application to be made;
(b)
the extent of the geographical area to which the application relates; and
(c)
the name and address of the person acting for the decision-maker to whom the application is to be made.

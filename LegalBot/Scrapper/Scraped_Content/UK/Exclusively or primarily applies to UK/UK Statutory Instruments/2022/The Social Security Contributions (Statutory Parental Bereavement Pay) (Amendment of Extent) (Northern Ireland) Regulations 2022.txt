(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 2 of the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 5) inserted a new Part 12ZD into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 7). This introduced the right to statutory parental bereavement pay in Northern Ireland.
These Regulations provide that the amendments made in the Social Security Contributions (Decisions and Appeals) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 and the Social Security (Contributions) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 extend to Northern Ireland to bring Northern Ireland in line with Great Britain.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared for these Regulations as they are part of a package of legislative measures and the relevant impact assessments are “Parental Bereavement Leave and Pay Regulatory Impact Assessment” and “Rural Needs Impact Assessment” which were published in June 2020. A copy of both impact assessments are available at: https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/consultations/parental-bereavement-leave-and-pay.

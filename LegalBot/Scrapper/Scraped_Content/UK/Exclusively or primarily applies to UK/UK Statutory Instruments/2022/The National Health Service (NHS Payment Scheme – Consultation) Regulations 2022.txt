These Regulations make provision concerning the consultation that NHS England must conduct prior to publishing the NHS payment scheme.
Regulation 2 prescribes the descriptions of persons who are to be considered “relevant providers” for the purpose of section 114C(8)(b) of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, and who must therefore be consulted by NHS England on the proposed NHS payment scheme under the process set out in sections 114C to 114F of that Act.

These Regulations amend the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 (“the 2014 Act”) and the Homelessness (Intentionality) (Specified Categories) (Wales) Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the 2014 Act to specify a further description of a person as having a priority need for accommodation for the purposes of Chapter 2 of Part 2 of that Act. That Chapter places duties on local housing authorities to help people who are homeless or threatened with homelessness.
Regulation 3 makes a corresponding change to the Homelessness (Intentionality) (Specified Categories) (Wales) Regulations 2015.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations.

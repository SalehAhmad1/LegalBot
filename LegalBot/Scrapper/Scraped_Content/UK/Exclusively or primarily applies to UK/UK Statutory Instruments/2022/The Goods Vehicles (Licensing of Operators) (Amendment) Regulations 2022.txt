16th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations amend laws of England and Wales and Scotland and of Northern Ireland that regulate the use of a goods vehicle on a road for the carriage of goods.
The amendments are necessary to meet obligations of the United Kingdom under Title I of Heading Three of Part Two of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the one part and the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the other part (Treaty Series No. 8 (2021); “the TCA”).
Overview
The TCA obliges the United Kingdom, from 21st May 2022, to license a person who carries goods to the European Union for hire or reward using a goods vehicle exceeding 2.5 tonnes in mass when laden. Presently, under both the laws of England and Wales and Scotland and of Northern Ireland, a person is required to hold a licence for such a carriage only if the goods vehicle exceeds 3.5 tonnes in mass when laden.
Under the current laws, there are three types of “operator’s licence” that may be issued: restricted, standard-national and standard-international.
Table 1: Operator’s licences that may be issued before amendments
Name Operator’s licence
Type Restricted
Standard-national
Standard-international
The principal effect of these Regulations is to allow for the same three types of operator’s licence to be issued, but in one of two categories. If an operator’s licence (of any type) authorises the use of one or more heavy goods vehicles, then it is a heavy goods vehicle licence (whether or not it also authorises the use of one or more light goods vehicles). If an operator’s licence authorises the use of one or more light goods vehicles, but no heavy goods vehicle, then it is a light goods vehicle licence.
The amendments define a “heavy goods vehicle” as a goods vehicle exceeding 3.5 tonnes when laden and a “light goods vehicle” as a goods vehicle not exceeding 3.5 tonnes when laden.
Table 2: Operator’s licences that may be issued after amendments
Name Operator’s licence
Category Heavy goods vehicle licence Light goods vehicle licence
Type Restricted Restricted
Standard-national Standard-national
Standard-international Standard-international
After the commencement of the Regulations, a pre-existing operator’s licence becomes a heavy goods vehicle licence and may be varied (on application) to authorise one or more light goods vehicles, for example, if it does not already authorise a sufficient number of goods vehicles.
A light goods vehicle licence is available to any person who uses only light goods vehicles for the carriage of goods. A standard-international light goods vehicle licence is sufficient for a person who is obligated after 11 p.m. on 20th May 2022 to hold an operator’s licence to use a light goods vehicle for the carriage of goods for hire or reward outside the United Kingdom. No person is obligated to hold a light goods vehicle licence (of any type) for any other reason.
These Regulations amend the laws referred to below also to implement further licensing obligations under the TCA, to consolidate laws, and to omit redundant provisions.
Part 2: Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009
Part 2 amends Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator and repealing Council Directive 96/26/EC (EUR 2009/1071; “EUR 2009/1071”).
The amendments are consequential on the amendments made to the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 (c. 23) by Part 6, the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act (Northern Ireland) 2010 (c. 2 (N.I.)) by Part 10 and the Goods Vehicles (Qualifications of Operators) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2012 (S.I. 2012/257 (N.I.)) by Part 12.
Part 3: Amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009
Part 3 amends Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 on common rules for access to the international road haulage market (EUR 2009/1072; “EUR 2009/1072”).
The amendment to Article 1 of EUR 2009/1072, which comes into force at 11 p.m. on 20th May 2022, implements Article 463(1) to (3) of the TCA.
Article 463(1) to (3) obligates the United Kingdom to require a driver of a vehicle exceeding 2.5 tonnes when laden that is being used in the United Kingdom for hire or reward as part of an international carriage of goods to carry a UK Licence for the Community or a Community licence.
The amendment to Article 8 clarifies that a driver who works for a holder of a Community licence, but who is not a national of the United Kingdom or a member State, must hold an EU driver attestation.
The terms “vehicle”, “driver”, “international carriage”, “UK Licence for the Community”, “Community licence” and “EU driver attestation” are defined in Article 2 of EUR 2009/1072.

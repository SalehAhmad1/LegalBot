(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument amends the Immigration and Asylum (Provision of Services or Facilities) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/3627) in the following ways.
Regulation 2(2) extends the eligibility period for applying for a one-off supply of vouchers for pregnant women and new mothers so that it begins eleven weeks before the expected date of birth and ends six months after the date of birth. It also amends the definition of “maternity payment” to remove reference to a specific financial value.
Regulation 2(3) increases the value of the one-off supply of vouchers for pregnant women and new mothers from £250 to £300.
Regulation 2(4) increases the additional weekly support for pregnant women and young children from £3.00 to £5.25 and for babies under 1 year old from £5.00 to £9.50. It also extends the eligibility for additional weekly payments for young children to children aged 3 years old.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

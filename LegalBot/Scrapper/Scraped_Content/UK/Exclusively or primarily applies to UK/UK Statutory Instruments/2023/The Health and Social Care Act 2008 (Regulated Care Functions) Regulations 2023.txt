Section 46A of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 imposes a duty on the Care Quality Commission (‘the Commission’) to conduct reviews of the exercise by English local authorities of regulated care functions. Following each review, the Commission must also assess the performance of those authorities and publish a report of its assessment. “Regulated care functions” are such functions relating to adult social care under Part 1 of the Care Act 2014 as may be prescribed in regulations. Regulation 2 of these Regulations prescribes those regulated care functions.

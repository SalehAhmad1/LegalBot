(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Gas Safety (Management) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/284) (“the 2023 Regulations”).
Regulation 1(2) of the 2023 Regulations provided for regulation 0 of those Regulations to come into force on 6th April 2025. However, regulation 1(2) should have referred to regulation 14(2)(a)(v) of the 2023 Regulations. These Regulations correct that error.
Regulation 14(2)(a)(v) of the 2023 Regulations revises the range within which the Wobbe Number of gas being conveyed in a network must fall for the purposes of the Gas Safety (Management) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/551).
A full impact assessment of the effect that the 2023 Regulations will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is published alongside the instrument on legislation.gov.uk. Copies of the impact assessment are also available from the Energy Policy Team, HSE, Engagement and Policy Division, 2.2 Redgrave Court, Bootle, L20 7HS.

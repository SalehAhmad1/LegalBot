(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health and Safety and Nuclear (Fees) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1378) (“the 2022 Regulations”) to make various changes to the fees fixed or determined by those Regulations.
In particular, these Regulations:
(a)
allow the Office for Nuclear Regulation (from 1st April 2023) and the Health and Safety Executive (from 1st October 2023) to recover their costs associated with applications under regulation 7(2) of the Ionising Radiations Regulations 2017;
(b)
enable the licensing authority to recover the costs of work relating to licences under the Explosives Regulations 2014, the Acetylene Safety (England and Wales and Scotland) Regulations 2014 and the Dangerous Goods in Harbour Areas Regulations 2016, where this work is carried out otherwise than following an application from the holder of the licence;
(c)
change the way in which certain fees in respect of work relating to such licences are determined.
These Regulations also introduce fee increases for some of the fees that were fixed or determined by the 2022 Regulations. The fees are raised by 2% from the level set out in the 2022 Regulations.
These Regulations also correct a number of errors in the 2022 Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

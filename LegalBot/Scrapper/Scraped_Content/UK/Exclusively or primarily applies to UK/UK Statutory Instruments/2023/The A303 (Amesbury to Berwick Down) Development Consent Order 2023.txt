Coming into force

An application has been made to the Secretary of State, under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008(1) (“the 2008 Act”) in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009(2) for an Order granting development consent.
The application concerns development which traverses the Stonehenge part of the Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites World Heritage Site, inscribed on the list of World Heritage in 1986 (reference number 373) by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Committee, pursuant to the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage 1972 and its setting.
The application was examined by a Panel of five members (“the Panel”) pursuant to Chapter 2 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act and carried out in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act, and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010(3).
The Panel, having examined the application with the documents that accompanied the application, and the representations made and not withdrawn, has, in accordance with section 74(2) of the 2008 Act, made a report and recommendation to the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn, and the report of the Panel, has decided to make an Order granting development consent for the development described in the application with modifications which in the opinion of the Secretary of State do not make any substantial changes to the proposals comprised in the application.
The Secretary of State is satisfied that replacement land has been or will be given in exchange for the special category land (as defined in article 34 of this Order), and the replacement land (as defined in that article) has been or will be vested in the prospective seller and subject to the same rights, trusts and incidents as attach to the special category land, and that, accordingly, section 131(4) of the 2008 Act applies. In accordance with section 132(3) of the 2008 Act, the Secretary of State is satisfied, having considered the report and recommendation of the Panel, that the parcels of land comprised in the special category (rights) land (as defined in article 34 of this Order) when burdened with a new right created under this Order, will be no less advantageous than they were before the making of this Order to the following person: (a) the persons in whom they are vested; (b) other persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other rights; and (c) the public.

8.—(1) Works constructed or maintained under this Order in relation to a highway which consists of or includes a carriageway are to be treated for the purposes of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act as major highway works if—
(a)
they are of a description mentioned in any of paragraphs (a), (c) to (e), (g) and (h) of section 86(3) (highway authorities, highways and related works) of that Act; or

(4) The provisions of the 1991 Act mentioned in paragraph (5) (which, together with other provisions of that Act, apply in relation to the execution of street works) and any regulations made, or code of practice issued or approved under, those provisions apply (with the necessary modifications) in relation to any stopping up, alteration or diversion of a street of a temporary nature by the undertaker under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary stopping up and restriction of use of streets) whether or not the stopping up, alteration or diversion constitutes street works within the meaning of that Act.
(5) The provisions of the 1991 Act(12) referred to in paragraph (4) are—
section 54(13) (advance notice of certain works), subject to paragraph (6);

(a)
affects the operation of section 87 (prospectively maintainable highways) of the 1991 Act, and the undertaker is not by reason of any duty under that article to maintain a street or to be taken to be the street authority in relation to that street for the purposes of Part 3 of that Act; or
(b)
has effect in relation to street works to which the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act apply.

(2) Subject to paragraphs (3), (6), (7) and (8), where a highway (other than a trunk road or special road) is altered or diverted under this Order, the altered or diverted part of the highway must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, that part of the highway, including any culverts or other structures laid under it, must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(3) Subject to paragraphs (6), (7) and (8), where a footpath or bridleway is altered or diverted under this Order along a vehicular private means of access, the altered or diverted part of the highway must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway authority and unless otherwise agreed in writing, be maintained (including any culverts or other structures laid under that part of the highway) by and at the expense of the person or persons with the benefit of the vehicular private means of access.
(4) Where a street which is not, and is not intended to be, a public highway is constructed, altered or diverted under this Order, the street (or part of the street as the case may be) must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority, unless otherwise agreed in writing, be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from its completion and at the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the street authority.
(5) Subject to paragraphs (6), (7) and (8), where a highway is de-trunked under this Order—
(a)
section 265(1) (transfer of property and liabilities upon a highway becoming or ceasing to be a trunk road) of the 1980 Act applies in respect of that highway; and
(b)
any alterations to that highway undertaken under powers conferred by this Order prior to and in connection with that de-trunking must, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from the date of de-trunking.

(7) In the case of any bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a trunk road or special road) over another highway which is not a trunk road or a special road, both the highway surface and structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from their completion.
(8) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a private right of way (whether or not it also carries a footpath or bridleway), the surface of the street and the structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker.
(9) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by the undertaker to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without affecting any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(10) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (9), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.

(4) The undertaker must not temporarily stop up, alter, divert or restrict the use of any street for which it is not the street authority without the consent of the street authority, which may attach reasonable conditions to any consent, but its consent must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) Any person who suffers loss by the suspension of any private right of way under this article is entitled to compensation to be determined, in case of dispute, as if it were a dispute under Part 1 (determination of questions of disputed compensation) of the 1961 Act.Access to works
12.  The undertaker may, for the purposes of the authorised development, form and lay out means of access, or improve existing means of access at such locations within the Order limits as the undertaker reasonably requires for the purposes of the authorised development.Discharge of water
13.—(1) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), the undertaker may use any watercourse, public sewer or drain for the drainage of water in connection with the construction or maintenance of the authorised development and for that purpose may lay down, take up and alter pipes and may, on any land within the Order limits, make openings into, and connections with, the watercourse, public sewer or drain.
(2) Any dispute arising from the making of connections to or the use of a public sewer or drain by the undertaker under paragraph (1) is to be determined as if it were a dispute under section 106 (right to communicate with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991(1).

(a)
in accordance with plans approved by the person to whom the sewer or drain belongs; and

(2) Protective works may be carried out—
(a)
at any time before or during the carrying out in the vicinity of the building of any part of the authorised development; or
(b)
after the completion of that part of the authorised development in the vicinity of the building at any time up to the end of the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which that part of the authorised development is first opened for use.
(3) Subject to paragraph (5), for the purpose of determining how the functions under this article are to be exercised the undertaker may enter and survey any building falling within paragraph (1) and any land within its curtilage.

(a)
enter the building and any land within its curtilage; and
(b)
where the works cannot be carried out reasonably conveniently without entering land which is adjacent to the building but outside its curtilage, enter the adjacent land (whether or not such adjacent land is inside or outside the Order limits) but not any building erected on it,
and if it is reasonably required, the undertaker may take possession, or exclusive possession, of the building and any land or part thereof for the purpose of carrying out the protective works.
(5) Before exercising—
(a)
a right under paragraph (1) to carry out protective works to a building;
(b)
a right under paragraph (3) to enter a building and land within its curtilage;

protective works are carried out under this article to a building; and
(b)
within the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which the part of the authorised development carried out in the vicinity of the building is first opened for use it appears that the protective works are inadequate to protect the building against damage caused by the carrying out or use of that part of the authorised development,
the undertaker must compensate the owners and occupiers of the building for any loss or damage sustained by them.
(9) Subject to article 37 (no double recovery) nothing in this article relieves the undertaker from any liability to pay compensation under section 152(1) (compensation in case where no right to claim in nuisance) of the 2008 Act.
(10) Section 13(2) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act applies to the entry onto land under this article to the same extent as it applies to the compulsory acquisition of land under this Order by virtue of section 125(3) (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act.
(11) Any compensation payable under paragraph (7) or (8) is to be determined, in case of dispute, as if it were a dispute under Part 1 (determination of questions of disputed compensation) of the 1961 Act.

(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in such position as described in sub-paragraph (a).

(b)
the day immediately following that on which further information has been supplied by the undertaker under paragraph 15; or
(c)
such longer period as may be agreed between the parties.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), in the event that the Secretary of State does not determine an application within the period set out in sub-paragraph (1), the Secretary of State is taken to have granted all parts of the application (without any condition or qualification) at the end of that period.
(3) Where—

an application has been made to the Secretary of State for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order;
(b)
the Secretary of State does not determine such application within the period set out in sub-paragraph (1); and

(2) In the event that the Secretary of State considers such further information to be necessary the Secretary of State must, within 21 business days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing specifying the further information required and (if applicable) to which part of the application it relates. In the event that the Secretary of State does not give such notification within that 21 business day period the Secretary of State is deemed to have sufficient information to consider the application and is not subsequently entitled to request further information without the prior agreement of the undertaker.
(3) Where further information is requested under this paragraph in relation to part only of an application, that part is treated as separate from the remainder of the application for the purposes of calculating the time periods referred to in paragraph 13 (applications made under requirements) and in this paragraph.

SCHEDULE 5
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR THE CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“5A.  If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 5 to the A303 (Amesbury to Berwick Down) Development Consent Order 2023 (“the 2023 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A (counter-notice requiring purchase of land not in notice to treat) to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 5 to the 2023 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land where it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 25 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 19 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 22(1) (compulsory acquisition of rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate context, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restricted covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 19), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 25(4) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND NOT IN NOTICE TO TREAT
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 26 (application of the 1981 Act) of the A303 (Amesbury to Berwick Down) Development Consent Order 2023 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 27(4) (acquisition of subsoil, etc., only) of the A303 (Amesbury to Berwick Down) Development Consent Order 2023 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or restrictive covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or restrictive covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

2.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the utility undertaker in question to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means—
(a)
in the case of a utility undertaker within paragraph (a) of the definition of that term, electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(1)), belonging to or maintained by the utility undertaker for the purposes of electricity supply;
(b)
in the case of a utility undertaker within paragraph (b) of the definition of that term, any mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by the utility undertaker for the purposes of gas supply;
(c)
in the case of a utility undertaker within paragraph (c) of the definition of that term—
(i)
mains, pipes or other water apparatus belonging to or maintained by the utility undertaker for the purposes of water supply; and
(ii)
mains, pipes or other water apparatus that is the subject of an agreement to adopt made under section 51A (agreements to adopt water main or service pipe at future date) of the Water Industry Act 1991(2); and
(d)
in the case of a sewerage undertaker—
(i)
any drain or works vested in the sewerage undertaker under the Water Industry Act 1991; and
(ii)

and includes a sludge main, disposal main (within the meaning of section 219 (general interpretation) of that Act) or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming part of any such sewer, drain or works, and in each case includes any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in” in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land;
“plan” includes all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably necessary to describe the works to be executed; and
“utility undertaker” means—
(a)
any licence holder within the meaning of Part 1 (electricity supply) of the Electricity Act 1989;
(b)
a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 (gas supply) of the Gas Act 1986(5);
(c)
a water undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991; and
(d)
a sewerage undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991,
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained.
3.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
4.—(1) Regardless of the temporary stopping up, alteration or diversion of streets under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary stopping up and restriction of use of streets), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to carry out and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the temporary stopping up, alteration or diversion was in that street.
(2) Where any street is stopped up under article 10 (permanent stopping up of streets and private means of access), any utility undertaker whose apparatus is in the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to the utility undertaker legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the utility undertaker in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of the utility undertaker to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 6 or to carry out works under paragraph 8.
5.  Despite any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than in accordance with this Part of this Schedule or by agreement.
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (6).
(2) If, for the purpose of carrying out any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably practicable use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to carry out any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being carried out by the utility undertaker, may be carried out by the undertaker, without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
8.—(1) Not less than 21 days before starting the carrying out of any works authorised by this Order that will or may affect any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be carried out.
(2) Those works must be carried out only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the carrying out of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 14 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 4 applies as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the carrying out of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency, but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) entitles the undertaker to carry out works to any apparatus, but upon receipt of notice from the undertaker, the utility undertaker must proceed to carry out such works as may be required without unnecessary delay.
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to the utility undertaker in question the proper and reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under this Part of this Schedule is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker in question any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction, maintenance or failure of any of the works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damage, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.

Acquisition of apparatus
30.—(1) Despite any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or if the Order covers any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which existing rights are enjoyed by Esso, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus or acquire, suspend, extinguish or affect any of the existing rights, otherwise than in accordance with this Part of this Schedule or by agreement with Esso.
(2) Where the undertaker acquires land which is subject to any existing rights and the provisions of paragraph 31 do not apply, the undertaker must retain any notice of the existing rights on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land.
Removal of apparatus and rights for alternative apparatus
31.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that any apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed by the undertaker and any right of Esso to maintain and use that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of Esso.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give Esso 56 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Esso reasonably needs to remove any apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Esso the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently grant alternative rights for the maintenance of that apparatus in accordance with paragraph (6).
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker must afford to and, if necessary, acquire for the benefit of Esso the necessary facilities and rights for the construction, maintenance and use of the alternative apparatus and access to it.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Esso and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration).
(5) Esso must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled in accordance with article 57 (arbitration), and after the grant to Esso of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2), proceed as soon as reasonably practicable using reasonable endeavours to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove (or if agreed between the parties allow the undertaker to remove) any redundant apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Schedule.
(6) Irrespective of sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to Esso that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction, removal or decommissioning of apparatus in the land of the undertaker or the construction of alternative apparatus, that work, instead of being executed by Esso, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if required, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Esso.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 3000 millimetres of the apparatus without Esso’s consent unless that apparatus is redundant and disconnected from Esso’s remaining system and is more than 3000 millimetres from any live apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
32.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to Esso facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Esso in accordance with this paragraph or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration).
(2) Alternative rights must be granted before any alternative apparatus is brought into use or any existing rights extinguished.
(3) The undertaker must grant Esso alternative rights by way of a deed of grant of easement, substantially in the form of Esso’s precedent from time to time. If any third party is required to be involved for the grant of alternative rights, the undertaker must secure their agreement at its own cost.
(4) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule or contained in the alternative rights requires Esso to divert or remove any alternative apparatus installed in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and any other agreement between Esso and the undertaker.
(5) In settling those terms and conditions for the alternative rights in respect of alternative apparatus the arbitrator must give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker and Esso for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised development and the apparatus respectively.
(6) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Esso than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Esso as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection
33.—(1) Unless a shorter period is otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Esso, not less than 35 days before commencing any specified work in relation to apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph 31(2) the undertaker must submit to Esso a plan of the works to be executed.

(4) Any reasonable requirements made by Esso under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days (unless a shorter period is otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Esso) beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(5) If Esso in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, this paragraph applies as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 31(2) but the undertaker is not required to serve Esso with a new notice under paragraph 31.
(6) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time but (unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Esso) in no case less than 28 days before commencing any specified work, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(7) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to Esso notice of the works it intends to carry out to remedy the emergency together with a plan as soon as is reasonably practicable and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(8) In relation to any works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 15 metres measured in any direction of apparatus, or (wherever situated) impose any load directly upon the apparatus or involve embankment works within 15 metres of the apparatus, the plan to be submitted to Esso under sub-paragraph (1) must include a material statement describing—
(a)
the exact position of the work;
(b)
the level at which the work is to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of its construction or renewal;
(d)
the position of the apparatus; and

by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to the apparatus.
Cathodic protection testing
34.  Where in the reasonable opinion of the undertaker—
(a)
the authorised development might interfere with the existing cathodic protection forming part of any apparatus; or
(b)
any apparatus might interfere with the proposed or existing cathodic protection forming part of the authorised development,
Esso and the undertaker must co-operate in undertaking the tests which the undertaker considers reasonably necessary for ascertaining the nature and extent of such interference and measures for providing or preserving cathodic protection.
Expenses
35.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Esso the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Esso in, or in connection with—

which may reasonably be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are required under this Part of this Schedule or are authorised by the Order.
(2) The scrap value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) Upon the submission of proper and reasonable estimates of costs and expenses to be incurred by Esso, the undertaker must pay Esso sufficiently in advance to enable Esso to undertake its obligations under this Part of this Schedule in a manner that is neutral to its cashflow provided that in the event that the costs incurred by Esso are less than the amount paid by the undertaker pursuant to this sub-paragraph (3) then Esso must promptly repay any overpayment to the undertaker.
(4) Where reasonably required by either party, in view of the complexity of any proposed works, timescales, phasing or costs, the parties must with due diligence and good faith negotiate a works agreement.
(5) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Esso by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of operations, capacity, dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs must be borne by the undertaker.
(6) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (5)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus;
(b)
the placing of apparatus that is to Esso’s current specification and standards for diversions and protective works must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of better type, greater capacity, greater dimensions or greater depth than those of the existing apparatus; and
(c)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
Damage to property and other losses
36.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must make reasonable compensation to Esso—
(a)
for all loss, damage, liability, costs and expenses reasonably suffered or incurred by Esso for which Esso is legally liable as a result of legally sustainable claims brought against Esso by any third party solely arising out of the carrying out of any relevant works;
(b)
for the cost reasonably incurred by Esso in making good any damage to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal or abandonment) arising from or caused by the carrying out of any relevant works and the authorised development; and
(c)
for the cost reasonably incurred by Esso in stopping, suspending and restoring the supply through its pipe-line and make reasonable compensation to Esso for any other expenses, losses, damages, penalty or costs incurred by Esso by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption provided that the same arises in consequence of the carrying out of any relevant works and the authorised development.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Esso on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Esso or in accordance with any requirement of Esso or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Irrespective of anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
the undertaker and Esso must at all times take reasonable steps to prevent and mitigate any loss, damage, liability, claim, cost or expense recoverable from the other under this Part of this Schedule; and
(b)
neither the undertaker nor Esso are liable for any loss, damage, liability, claim, cost or expense suffered or incurred by the other to the extent that the same are incurred as a result of or in connection with the sole, partial or complete breach of this Part of this Schedule or negligence arising out of an act, omission, default or works of the other, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) Esso must give to the undertaker reasonable notice of any claim or demand to which this paragraph 36 applies. If Esso agrees (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the undertaker may at its own expense conduct all negotiations for the settlement of the same and any litigation that may arise therefrom. Esso must not compromise or settle any claim or demand or make any admission which might be prejudicial to the claim or demand without the undertaker’s consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). Esso must, at the request of the undertaker, afford all reasonable assistance for the purpose of contesting any such claim or action, and is entitled to be repaid all reasonable expenses incurred in so doing.
(5) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule excludes or limits the liability of the undertaker for death or personal injury resulting from the negligence of the undertaker or any of its officers, employees or agents.
(6) In this paragraph “relevant works” means such of the authorised development as—
(a)
does, will or is likely to affect any apparatus; or
(b)
involves a physical connection or attachment to any apparatus.
Co-operation and reasonableness
37.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, the undertaker requires the removal of apparatus under this Part of this Schedule or Esso makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker must use reasonable endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Esso’s undertaking and Esso must use its reasonable endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) The undertaker and Esso must act reasonably in respect of any given term of this Part of this Schedule and, in particular, (without prejudice to generality) where any consent or expression of satisfaction is required by this Part of this Schedule it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Miscellaneous
38.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Esso in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made provided that the terms of the relevant enactment or agreement are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Order, including this Part of this Schedule. In the case of any inconsistency, the provisions of this Order, including this Part of this Schedule, prevail.

(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (4) and paragraph 47, if, within a reasonable period, being not less than 28 days beginning with the date on which a notice in respect of any drainage work is served under sub-paragraph (2) on the undertaker, the undertaker has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the reasonable requirements of the notice and has not subsequently made reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the Agency may do what is reasonably necessary for such compliance and any reasonable expenditure incurred by the Agency in so doing is recoverable from the undertaker.
(4) In the event of any dispute as to the reasonableness of any requirement of a notice served under sub-paragraph (2), the Agency must not, except in the case of an emergency, exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (3) until the dispute has been finally determined in accordance with paragraph 49.

45.  If by reason of construction of the specified work the Agency’s access to flood defences or equipment maintained for flood defence purposes is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access that will allow the Agency to maintain the flood defence or use the equipment no less effectively than was possible before the obstruction within 24 hours of the undertaker becoming aware of such obstruction.

the failure of any such work,
damage to the fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the Agency may serve notice on the undertaker requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage, or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.

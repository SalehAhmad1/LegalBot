These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Southport during air displays 
associated with the Southport Air Show that are due to take place there between 8th September 
2023 and 10th September 2023 (inclusive). 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the

the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(2) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(3), the Flying Display Director of the 
Southport Airshow may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Notice to Aviation (NOTAM).

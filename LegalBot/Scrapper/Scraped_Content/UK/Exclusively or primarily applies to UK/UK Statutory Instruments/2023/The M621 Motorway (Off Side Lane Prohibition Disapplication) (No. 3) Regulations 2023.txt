23rd October 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace the M621 Motorway (off side lane prohibition disapplication) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/802) and the M621 Motorway (Off Side Lane Prohibition Disapplication) (No. 2) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/840) because each of those instruments contained an error in its commencement provisions.
Regulations 2 and 3 disapply regulation 12(2) of the Motorways Traffic (England and Wales) Regulations 1982 (S.I. 1982/1163) in relation to specified lengths of the westbound carriageway of the M621 Motorway in Leeds. Regulation 12(2) of those Regulations prohibits certain vehicles from using the off side lane (right hand lane) of a motorway carriageway with 3 or more lanes, other than in specified circumstances. The lengths of carriageway to which the disapplication under regulation 3 of these Regulations relates includes the length of carriageway covered by a corresponding disapplication under the Motorways Traffic (M621 Motorway) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/1077). Accordingly, those Regulations are revoked when the disapplication under regulation 3 of these Regulations comes into force.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

17 May 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Rent Act 1977 (“the 1977 Act”) in consequence of the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (“the 2016 Act”).
Section 239 of the 2016 Act abolishes assured, secure and other tenancies of dwellings in Wales and the 2016 Act provides for them to convert to occupation contracts, of which there are two types: secure contracts and standard contracts.
Regulation 2(2), (3)(a) and (4) amend sections 2 and 152 of and Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the 1977 Act to insert references to secure contracts, in consequence of the abolition of assured tenancies in Wales. Regulation 2(3)(b) inserts provision into section 152 of the 1977 Act which directs the reader to the relevant abolitions made by section 239 of the 2016 Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this instrument.

An object which belongs to that class will fall within the definition of treasure if it is at least 200 years old when found.
Article 2(5) designates two classes of objects for the purposes of section 1(2) of the Treasure Act 1996, so as to exclude objects belonging to those classes from the definition of treasure.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into force on 13th February 2023 a variation of the Public Lending Right Scheme 1982 (“the Scheme”) made by the Secretary of State.
The Scheme provides for payments to be made to authors based on the number of times their books are lent out by public libraries. This includes remote loans of e-books and audio books. The effect of the variation is to increase the rate per loan set out in article 46(1)(a) of the Scheme from 11.26p to 30.53p. The rate per loan is the sum attributable to each qualifying loan for the purpose of calculating the amount payable in respect of loans of a particular book by public libraries.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

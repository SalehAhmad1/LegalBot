the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 new scheme has, in response to a request from the individual, at any time agreed to pay an amount in respect of the annual allowance charge.
(3) The scheme pays notice is to be treated as not having been given to the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 new scheme but as having instead been given to the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 legacy scheme (so that the latter scheme administrator, and not the former, became jointly and severally liable under section 237B(7) of FA 2004 with the individual for the amount specified in the notice).
(4) The request from the individual is to be treated as not having been given to the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 new scheme but as having instead been given to the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 legacy scheme.
(5) Any payment made by the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 new scheme—
(a)
in satisfaction of the joint and several liability as a result of the notice, or
(b)
under the agreement to pay in response to the request from the individual,
is to be treated as not having been made by that scheme administrator but as having been made instead by the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 legacy scheme.
(6) Where only part of the pension scheme input amount in relation to the scheme for the tax year is determined by reference to the individual’s remediable service rights under the scheme—
(a)
paragraph (3) or (4) applies to the scheme pays notice, or to the request from the individual (as the case may be), only so far as the annual allowance charge for the tax year is referable to those rights;
(b)
paragraph (5) applies to a payment made by the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 new scheme only so far as the annual allowance charge in respect of which it is made is referable to those rights.
(7) For the purposes of paragraph (6) an annual allowance charge is, so far as possible, to be regarded as referable to rights of the individual under the scheme that are not remediable service rights.
(8) In determining the individual’s pension input amounts (for any tax year)—
(a)
any adjustment made under section 237E of FA 2004 to the benefits payable to the individual in consequence of a payment within paragraph (5) is to be ignored;
(b)
any adjustment made to the benefits payable to the individual in consequence of a payment under paragraph (5)(b) is to be ignored.
(9) Where the amount of the annual allowance charge in respect of which the scheme pays notice is given, or the request from the individual is made (as the case may be), reduces as a result of the operation of a relevant rectification provision, the notice or the request is to be treated as specifying—
(a)
the reduced amount, or
(b)
where the notice or the request specified only a proportion of the annual allowance charge, the same proportion of the reduced amount.
(10) Neither the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 new scheme, nor the scheme administrator of the Chapter 1 legacy scheme, is required, in consequence of anything in this regulation, to amend any accounting-for-tax return they have already made.
(11) In this Chapter “remediable service rights”, in relation to an individual and a Chapter 1 scheme, means rights under the scheme in respect of the individual’s remediable service in an office or employment.
(12) When determining, for the purposes of paragraph (11), the rights of an individual that are in respect of the individual’s remediable service in an employment or office, any rights that result from voluntary arrangements entered into by the individual are to be ignored.

2020 c. 14. “FA 2020” is defined as the Finance Act 2020 (c. 14) in section 103 of the Finance Act 2022.Nigel Huddleston

2nd February 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make modifications for the purposes of applying the correct tax treatment to public service pension schemes which are affected by the rectification of discrimination provisions contained in the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7) (“PSPJOA 2022”). Modifications are made to enactments in their application in relation to a relevant person under the authority of section 11(2) and (3) of the Finance Act 2022 (c. 3). Authority for the retrospective effect of certain modifications made by these Regulations is provided for by section 11(4)(a) of the Finance Act 2022.
Under the rectification provisions in that Act, pension scheme members (except members of local government schemes) can choose the benefits they will receive or, for members of judicial schemes, the scheme they will receive benefits from, for the relevant remedy period (1st April 2015 to 31st March 2022 or, for Agency schemes (as defined in section 38 of PSPJOA 2022), 1st April 2016 to 31st March 2022). Members of local government schemes will receive an automatic uplift in their benefits in the remedy period (1st April 2015 to 31st March 2022 or, for local government pension schemes in England and Wales, from 1st April 2014) where the remedy applies.
Part 1 provides for citation, commencement, effect and interpretation.
Part 2 contains modifications to the pension tax enactments relevant to the main areas affected: contributions (Chapter 1), annual allowance (Chapter 2), benefits (Chapter 3), lifetime allowance (Chapters 4, 5 and 6) and transfers (Chapter 7).
In relation to contributions to pension schemes, Chapter 1 provides that tax relief is preserved on contributions to a new scheme that is subject to the roll-back of pensionable service to a legacy scheme under section 2 of PSPJOA 2022 (regulation 3).
For the annual allowance tax charge, Chapter 2 contains provisions to achieve parity of tax treatment in respect of pension rights under legacy and new schemes in relation to calculating the allowance and tax charge (regulations 4, 12, 13, 14), liability to, payment of tax and repayment of overpaid tax (regulations 8, 9, 10) and administrative provisions for the scheme administrators of both legacy and new schemes (regulations 5, 6, 7, 11 and 15).
In respect of benefits paid to members (or to their estate after death), the main provisions in Chapter 3 (regulations 16 to 26, 28 and 29) provide that payments of pension and lump sums affected by the rectification provisions in PSPJOA 2022 are treated (in relation to the remedy period) as authorised member payments for tax purposes, even where they would otherwise not meet the conditions (as to timing of payment, for example) for such treatment.
Chapters 4, 5 and 6 contain provisions to preserve the tax treatment for the lifetime allowance charge for legacy and new schemes affected by the rectification provisions, including reporting and payment of the charge (regulations 32, 33), claims for overpayment (regulation 34), liability and discharge (regulations 35, 36) and individual and fixed protection (regulations 37 to 41). Chapter 7 (regulation 43) provides for certain transfers of sums or assets held in a partnership pension account to a Chapter 1 scheme or a judicial scheme to be treated as recognised transfers for the purposes of the pension provisions in the Finance Act 2004 (c. 12).
Part 3 modifies Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2020 (c. 14) in order to preserve income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax treatment for compensation payments made under or by virtue of Part 1 of PSPJOA 2022.

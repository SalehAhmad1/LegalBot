Article 4 amends article 24A of the Principal Order to increase the amount of the allowance known as “the armed forces independent payment” which is designed to provide financial support to cover extra costs that a recipient of that benefit may incur as a result of a relevant injury. That amount is increased to £172.75 per week.
Article 5 amends article 24D of the Principal Order to increase the amount that may be paid in settlement of liabilities due under an agreement between a claimant and Motability in respect of the hire or hire purchase of a vehicle. That amount is increased to £71.00 per week.
Article 6 amends Schedule 3 to the Principal Order by inserting new descriptors into Tables 2 and 9, to make three temporary awards permanent.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

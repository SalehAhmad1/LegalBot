(a)
a member (“P”) retired or died without retiring before the amendment day; and
(b)
condition A or B is met.
(2) Condition A is that amounts were paid to a person before the amendment day in respect of P’s retirement or death under arrangements made for the purpose of providing benefits before the amendment day corresponding to an anticipated increase in benefits (including an increase from zero) payable under the principal scheme as a consequence of amendments made by these Regulations.
(3) Condition B is that if these Regulations had come into force on the day before the day on which P retired or died, there would have been an increase in the benefits which would have been payable to a person in respect of P’s retirement or death, under the principal scheme, as a consequence of amendments made by these Regulations.
(4) In this Part, expressions defined for the purpose of the 2017 Regulations have the same meaning as in those Regulations.Meaning of “interim amendments payments amount” and “pre-amendment day benefits increase amount”
68.  In this Part—
(a)
the “interim amendments payments amount” means the total amount that was paid to a person under arrangements made for the purpose of providing increased benefits before the amendment day in respect of P’s retirement or death under the principal scheme in anticipation of the amendments to be made by these Regulations;
(b)
the “pre-amendment day benefits increase amount” means the total amount of the increase in benefits under the principal scheme that would have been payable before the amendment day in respect of P’s retirement or death, after deduction of any contributions that would have been payable, as a consequence of amendments made by these Regulations, if those amendments had come into force on the day before the day on which P retired or died without having retired.Additional payment where no or insufficient interim amendments payments made
69.—(1) Paragraph (2) applies where the interim amendments payments amount in relation to a person is less than the pre-amendment day benefits increase amount.
(2) The administrators must pay to the person the amount of the difference between the two amounts mentioned in paragraph (1).Repayment of any excess interim amendments payments
70.—(1) Paragraph (2) applies where the interim amendments payments amount in relation to a person is greater than the pre-amendment day benefits increase amount.
(2) The administrators may recover the difference between the two amounts mentioned in paragraph (1) from the person, including by way of deduction from any benefits to which P is entitled under the principal scheme, including in such instalments from payments of retirement pension as the administrators may determine.Option to take partial retirement: pre-commencement day cessation
71.—(1) For the purposes of regulation 28 of the 2017 Regulations, a member is to be treated as having taken partial retirement in relation to an eligible fee-paid judicial office (“the relevant office”) if—
(a)
the member ceased to hold the relevant office before the commencement day;
(b)
the member would, but for the date of cessation, have satisfied the conditions in regulation 27(1) of the 2017 Regulations;
(c)
before the coming into force of these Regulations, the member was paid amounts in respect of partial retirement in relation to the relevant office (despite not having an entitlement to such payments under regulation 27 of the 2017 Regulations);
(d)
no notice of rescission under paragraph (3) has been given by the member,
and accordingly benefits paid to or in respect of the member under Part 3 or 6 of the 2017 Regulations (whether before or after the coming into force of these Regulations) on the basis of the member’s reckonable service in the relevant office are to be treated as lawfully paid.
(2) A member to whom paragraph (1) applies is deemed to have given a notice under regulation 27(2) of the 2017 Regulations, received by the appropriate Minister on the date when entitlement to pension payments for the relevant office commenced.
(3) Where a member has received benefits in the circumstances described in paragraph (1), that member may rescind the taking of partial retirement by giving notice in writing to the appropriate Minister, in the form determined by the appropriate Minister, before 1st November 2023.
(4) A member is not to be treated as having ceased to hold a judicial office for the purposes of paragraph (1) or (2) if they would not be so treated for the purposes of regulation 27 of the 2017 Regulations (see paragraph (5) of that regulation).
(5) Where benefits have been paid to or in respect of a member under Part 3 or 6 of the 2017 Regulations in the circumstances described in paragraph (1), regulation 17(3) of the 2017 Regulations applies in relation to the member as if “the pension start day” meant the day on which the notice referred to in paragraph (2) has effect.
(6) In regulation 27(1) of the 2017 Regulations, omit “on or after the commencement day”.
(7) In this regulation expressions defined for the purpose of the 2017 Regulations have the same meaning as in those Regulations.Dominic Raab

Determination of PRS value for use in this Part
128B.—(1) In this Part, PRS means the pro-rated salary value determined using the following formula—
where—
RS is determined in accordance with paragraph (2)
JS is determined in accordance with paragraph (3)
WS is determined in accordance with paragraphs (4) to (10).
(2) RS is the amount of reckonable service for which benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions that a FPJABS member had at their retirement date.
(3) JS is the number of years of qualifying judicial service that a FPJABS member had at their retirement date, subject to a maximum of 20 years.
(4) WS is determined under paragraph (5), (7), or (9) (whichever applies).
(5) WS is determined in accordance with paragraph (6) where, at the member’s retirement—
(a)
the FPJABS member has reckonable service in only one eligible fee-paid judicial office; or
(b)
the FPJABS member—
(i)
has reckonable service in more than one eligible fee-paid judicial office; but
(ii)
did not at any time before their retirement hold two or more eligible fee-paid judicial offices simultaneously.
(6) WS is the appropriate annual salary of the judicial office held by the FPJABS member immediately before their retirement.
(7) Except in a case to which paragraph (9) applies, WS is determined in accordance with paragraph (8) where—
(a)
immediately before their retirement, the FPJABS member has reckonable service in more than one eligible fee-paid judicial office; and
(b)
at any time before their retirement, the FPJABS member held two or more eligible fee-paid judicial offices simultaneously.
(8) WS is the value determined in Step 5, determined by taking the following steps—
Step 1
Determine a weighting value for each eligible fee-paid judicial office for which benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions and which was held simultaneously with another eligible fee-paid judicial office by dividing the member’s reckonable service in that office by RS.
Step 2
Determine a WS component value for each of the offices in Step 1 by multiplying the weighting value for that office by the appropriate annual salary for that office as if—
(i)
that office were the only office in which the FPJABS member had reckonable service immediately before their retirement, and
(ii)
the FPJABs member held that office (and held no other judicial office) immediately before their retirement.
Step 3
Determine a weighting value for each eligible fee-paid judicial office for which benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions and which was not held simultaneously with another eligible fee-paid judicial office by dividing the member’s reckonable service in that office by RS.
Step 4
Determine a WS component value for each of the offices in Step 3 by multiplying the weighting value for that office by the appropriate annual salary for that office which for this purpose is—
(i)
where the FPJABS member held a single judicial office immediately before their retirement the appropriate annual salary of that judicial office,
(ii)
where the FPJABS member held more than one judicial office immediately before their retirement, the highest appropriate annual salary of those offices.
Step 5
Add together the WS component values determined under Steps 2 and 4.
(9) WS is determined in accordance with paragraph (10) where—
(a)
during one or more parts of the period for which the FPJABS member held an eligible fee-paid judicial office for which benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions (“office A”), the FPJABS member held one or more other eligible fee-paid judicial offices simultaneously; and
(b)
during one or more parts of that period the FPJABS member held no eligible fee-paid judicial office other than office A.
(10) WS is determined by taking the steps in paragraph (8) but—
(a)
office A is to be treated as two different eligible fee-paid judicial offices—
(i)
the first of which (“the first office”) is held for the period (or the aggregate of the periods) mentioned in paragraph (9)(a), and accordingly, is taken into consideration in Steps 1 and 2 in paragraph (8), and
(ii)
the second of which (“the second office”) is held for the period (or the aggregate of the periods) mentioned in paragraph (9)(b) and, accordingly is taken into consideration in Steps 3 and 4 in paragraph (8);
(b)
the FPJABS member’s reckonable service in office A is to be apportioned between the first and the second offices in the same proportion as that between the period P held the first office and the period P held the second office.
(11) This regulation is subject to the modification of the calculation of the values of RS, WS and JS as specified in regulation 128K(1) for the purposes of that regulation.
(12) For the purpose of this regulation, the date of death of an unretired member is treated as the date of that member’s retirement.

128C.—(1) Membership of the FPJABS is open to unretired and retired members of the principal scheme (but not to opted out members) for whom benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions in respect of one or more eligible fee-paid judicial offices in which the member has qualifying fee-paid service between 31st March 1995 and 5th April 2006.
(2) A person to whom membership of the FPJABS is open may become an FPJABS member by giving notice in writing (a “membership notice”) to the administrators before 1st April 2024 (or by such later date as the administrators may agree).
(3) Subject to the provisions of this Part, an FPJABS member has the right to purchase added units of benefit in relation to one or more eligible fee-paid judicial offices for which benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions.

(2) The assumed contribution commencement date must be between 31st March 1995 and 5th April 2006.
(3) An unretired FPJABS member must nominate an age between the member’s earliest normal pension age under the pre-1995 provisions and the age at which the member would be required by any enactment to vacate all judicial offices held, at which that member intends to retire (the “assumed retirement age”).
Notice to purchase added units of benefit
128E.—(1) A membership notice given by a retired FPJABS member must specify—
(a)
the assumed contribution commencement date;
(b)
the date the member retired; and
(c)
the number of added units of benefit the member would like to purchase.
(2) A membership notice given by an unretired FPJABS member must specify—
(a)
the assumed contribution commencement date;
(b)
the assumed retirement age;
(c)
the number of qualifying fee-paid days which the member proposes to work, in eligible fee-paid offices for which benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions, each year to the period ending with the date on which the member reaches the assumed retirement age; and
(d)
the number of added units of benefit the member would like to purchase.
Limits on maximum purchases

(2) The aggregated retirement benefit must not exceed the figure equal to the lesser of—
(a)
the amount referred to in paragraph (3)(a), (b) or (c) as appropriate; or

2/3rds of the amount determined in accordance with the following formula—
where—
RB is the member’s retained benefits, and
(ii)
1/60th of the value of PRS for each year of qualifying judicial service, subject to a maximum of 40 years of qualifying judicial service.
(3) The amount referred to in paragraph (2)(a) is—
(a)
where the member retires at or after the member’s earliest normal pension age under the pre-1995 provisions, the amount calculated by applying the appropriate fraction (determined in accordance with the table below, into which a fraction of a year is to be interpolated in accordance with paragraph (4)) to the value of PRS—
Complete years of qualifying judicial service Appropriate fraction
1 1/60
2 2/60
3 3/60

(c)
where the member retires before the member’s earliest normal pension age under the pre-1995 provisions on any other ground, an amount determined by adding together the amount for each of the member’s offices for which benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions, determined in accordance with the following formula—
where—
N is the reckonable service which the member accrued in the office before the date on which the member retired, calculated under regulation 5(1) as though regulation 5(2) did not apply
JS is the number of years of qualifying judicial service that the member has, subject to a maximum of—
(i)
15 years for an office specified in Table 1 or 2 in Schedule 1, or

15 years for an office specified in Table 1 or 2 in Schedule 1, or
(ii)
20 years for an office specified in Table 3 in Schedule 1
S is the appropriate annual salary of the judicial office held by the member immediately before their retirement and where the member held more than one judicial office immediately before retirement, reference is to the highest appropriate annual salary of those offices
Z is the period, or the aggregate of the periods, expressed in years and any fraction of a year during which the member held one or more eligible fee-paid judicial offices, disregarding any day in respect of which the conditions in regulation 4(2) (qualifying fee-paid days) are not met

(4) Where the number of years of qualifying judicial service at retirement is less than ten and is not an exact number of years, the interpolation referred to in paragraph (3)(a) is to be effected as follows—
(a)
where the number of complete years of qualifying judicial service is less than five, 1/365 of a sixtieth for each additional day is to be added to the appropriate fraction;
(b)
where the number of complete years of qualifying judicial service is five, 3/365 of a sixtieth for each additional day is to be added to the appropriate fraction;
(c)
where the number of complete years of qualifying judicial service is greater than five, 8/365 of a sixtieth for each additional day is to be added to the appropriate fraction.
(5) The lump sum benefit must not exceed the figure calculated in accordance with sub-paragraphs (a) or (c) as appropriate—
(a)
on retirement before the member’s earliest normal pension age under the pre-1995 provisions other than on the ground of ill health, or at or after the member’s earliest normal pension age under the pre-1995 provisions, the fraction of PRS obtained under subparagraph (b);
(b)
the fraction is determined in accordance with the scale set out in the Occupational Pension Schemes (Maximum Rate Lump Sum) Regulations 1987(4), but for the ‘period of service’ in that scale using the member’s qualifying judicial service;
(c)
on retirement before the member’s earliest normal pension age under the pre-1995 provisions on the ground of ill-health, the fraction of PRS obtained under sub-paragraph (d);
(d)
the fraction is determined in accordance with the scale set out in the Occupational Pension Schemes (Maximum Rate Lump Sum) Regulations 1987, but for the ‘period of service’ in that scale using a value for the member’s qualifying judicial service as if the member had continued in eligible fee-paid judicial office until the date on which they reached their earliest normal pension age under the pre-1995 provisions.
(6) Where the maximum number of added units of benefit would (apart from this paragraph) be negative, it is instead nil.
(7) Any unit of added benefit purchased must not be taken into account for the purposes of determining the amount of the member’s reckonable service, or the length of the member’s qualifying judicial service.

Limits on contributions by unretired FPJABS members
128I.—(1) The aggregate amount of the lump sum payments an unretired FPJABS member may make is the smaller of—

where—
FI is the unretired FJABS member’s annual fee income for the tax year in question which is subject to income tax, or if lower, the permitted maximum for that tax year
C is the sum of any contributions made by the unretired FPJABS member to any other judicial pension scheme in that tax year, excluding any contributions made by the member in accordance with regulation 3 of the Judicial Pensions (Contributions) Regulations 2012; and

X is the difference between the maximum amount which the unretired FPJABS member could have contributed under regulation 128G(3) and the amount the member actually contributed under that provision.
(4) In this regulation, “the periodic contributions start date” has the same meaning as in regulation 128G(4).
Cost of added units of benefit for retired FPJABS members
128J.—(1) For a retired FPJABS member, where on the date the member retired they had a spouse, civil partner or qualifying child, the cost of added units of benefit is to be determined in accordance with the formula—
where—
A is the sum of the personal benefits and family benefits percentage figures set out in the appropriate table in Schedule 3 to the 1995 Regulations on the assumed contribution commencement date, which correspond to the reckonable service specified in the definition of B
B is the amount of reckonable service in eligible fee-paid office for which benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions, which the member accrued in the period beginning with the assumed contribution commencement date and ending with the date on which the member retired, calculated in accordance with regulation 5(1) as though paragraph (2) of that regulation does not apply
C is the total of the fees paid to the member in respect of qualifying fee-paid days in the period referred to in B
D is the number of added units of benefit which the unretired FPJABS member has notified to the administrators that the member would like to purchase.
(2) For a retired FPJABS member, where on the date the member retired they did not have a spouse, civil partner or qualifying child at any point in the period beginning with the assumed contribution commencement date and ending with the date the member retired, the cost of added units of benefit is to be determined in accordance with paragraph (1) as if in the definition of A, instead of referring to the personal benefits and family benefits percentage figures, it referred only to the personal benefits percentage figure.
(3) For a retired FPJABS member who did not have a spouse, civil partner or qualifying child on the date on which they retired, but did at some point in the period beginning with the assumed contribution commencement date and ending with the date they retired, the cost of added units of benefit is to be determined in accordance with the formula—
E + F
where—
E is the cost for the period beginning with the assumed contribution commencement date and ending with the date on which the member last had a spouse, civil partner or qualifying child, determined in accordance with paragraph (1) as if “C” referred to the total of fees paid to the member in respect of qualifying fee-paid days in that period
F is the cost for the period beginning with the day after the date the member last had a spouse, civil partner or qualifying child (“the start date”) and ending with the date the member retired, determined in accordance with paragraph (2) as if “C” referred to the total of fees paid to the member in respect of qualifying fee-paid days in that period.
Cost of added units of benefit for unretired FPJABS members
128K.—(1) The cost of each added unit of benefit is determined in accordance with the following formula—
where—
A is the sum of the personal benefits and family benefits percentage figures set out in the first table in Schedule 3 to the 1995 Regulations on the assumed contribution commencement date, which correspond to the length of time between the assumed contribution commencement date and the assumed retirement date
B is the length of time referred to in the definition of A, in years and fractions of a year, subject to the limit on total contributions allowed in any one year by regulation 128I
For the purposes of this regulation, PRS is to be determined as if—
(i)
the value of WS were determined as if references to the member’s retirement were instead references to the assumed commencement date,
(ii)
the value of RS were determined on the assumption that the member would retire at the assumed retirement date having worked the number of qualifying fee-paid days which they specified in their membership notice that they propose to work each year,
(iii)
the value of JS were determined on the assumption that the member retires at their assumed retirement age, subject to a maximum of 20 years.
(2) For each part unit of added benefit purchased the cost is that determined in paragraph (1) multiplied by the appropriate decimal fraction, to a minimum of £0.01.
Valuation of benefits
128L.—(1) If an FPJABS member retires, the administrators must—
(a)
calculate the number of added units of benefit that the member has purchased by dividing the total contributions made by the member under regulation 128G by the cost of an added unit of benefit as determined under regulation 128K; and
(b)
notify the member of that amount.
(2) Any added unit of benefit that the member has purchased entitles them to—
(a)
an additional pension benefit under the pre-1995 provisions of 1/40th of the value of PRS; and
(b)
an additional lump sum of 2/40ths of the value of PRS.
(3) A surviving adult in relation to an FPJABS member is, in respect of any added unit of benefit purchased by the member, entitled to an additional pension of 1/80th of the value of PRS.
(4) A relevant person in relation to an FPJABS member is, in respect of any added unit of benefit purchased by the member, entitled to an additional children’s pension as follows—
(a)
where there is no surviving adult in relation to the deceased FPJABS member, or where there is but the surviving adult subsequently dies—
(i)
where, and for so long as, an eligible child’s pension is payable under regulation 11V at an annual rate equal to two thirds of the rate of the member’s pension, the eligible child’s pension is increased by 1/60th of PRS,
(ii)
where, and for so long as, an eligible child’s pension is payable under regulation 11V at an annual rate equal to one third of the rate of the member’s pension, the eligible child’s pension is increased by 1/120th of PRS;
(b)
where there is a surviving adult in relation to the deceased FPJABS member—
(i)
where, and for so long as, an eligible child’s pension is payable under regulation 11V at an annual rate equal to one half of the annual rate of the member’s pension, the eligible child’s pension is increased by 1/80th of PRS,
(ii)
where, and for so long as, an eligible child’s pension is payable under regulation 11V at an annual rate equal to one quarter of the rate of the member’s pension, the eligible child’s pension is increased by 1/160th of PRS.
(5) The FPJABS member, surviving adult, or relevant person in respect of an eligible child are entitled to proportionate benefits for any part of an added unit of benefit that has been purchased.
(6) If an unretired FPJABS member retires on the ground of ill health or dies before their earliest normal pension age under the pre-1995 provisions, they are to be credited with the number of added units of benefit for which they are paying contributions.
(7) If an unretired FPJABS member ceases making contributions before their earliest normal pension age under the pre-1995 provisions, for reasons other than death or retirement on the ground of ill-health—
(a)
the administrators must—
(i)
calculate the number of added units of benefit that the member has purchased by the date of cessation, by dividing the total contribution made by the member under regulation 128G by the cost of an added unit of benefit as determined under regulation 128K, and
(ii)
notify the member of that amount;
(b)
at the date of cessation, the member must be credited with added units of benefit equivalent to the number calculated under sub-paragraph (a).
Resumption of contributions
128M.—(1) If an unretired FPJABS member ceases to make periodic contributions, they may apply to the administrators to resume making periodic contributions but any such application—
(a)
must not be accepted if the member has reached the assumed retirement age;
(b)
must not result in the member making contributions at a rate that is higher than the rate at which they were contributing before they ceased to pay periodic contributions; and
(c)
must be accompanied by a declaration signed by the member stating that they have no reason to believe that health may prevent continuation of service until the assumed retirement age.
(2) If a member who has ceased to participate in the FPJABS under regulation 128G(6)(d), subsequently starts to pay contributions again, this regulation and regulations 128G, 128K, 128L, 128N and 128O apply separately to those contributions and the value of benefits purchased with them.
(3) If an application by a member under paragraph (1) to resume making contributions has been accepted and the member subsequently—
(a)
dies or retires on the ground of ill-health within 12 months of the date on which they started to pay periodic contributions again; or
(b)
dies or retires on the ground of ill-health because of an incapacity to which they became subject within 12 months of that date,
regulation 128L(6) does not apply unless the administrators are satisfied that the declaration given under paragraph (1)(c) was made in good faith.
Refund of contributions: family benefits
128N.—(1) If an unretired member of FPJABS who has bought units of added benefit is not married or in a civil partnership and has no qualifying children, at the time they retire, die, or otherwise cease to be a member of the principal scheme, they or their estate is entitled to a refund in accordance with this regulation.
(2) The amount to be refunded to a member of the FPJABS is calculated by applying the percentage figure determined in accordance with the formula below to the member’s annual fee income for each year for any offices in relation to which benefits are calculated under the pre-1995 provisions, during the period from the date they ceased to have a spouse or civil partner, or eligible child, until the date of retirement—
where—
A is the family benefits percentage figure set out in the appropriate table in Schedule 3 to the 1995 Regulations which corresponds to the length of time between the assumed contribution commencement date and the assumed retirement date
B is the length of time referred to in the definition of A, in years and fractions of a year.
(3) Where a refund is payable under this regulation it must be paid together with interest.
Refund of contributions: excess contributions
128O.—(1) If the total contributions paid by an unretired FPJABS member exceed the smaller of—
(a)
the amount necessary to purchase the number of added units of benefit notified to the administrators by the member in the member’s membership notice; and
(b)
the amount necessary to purchase the maximum number of added units of benefit permissible under this Part (calculated on the basis that the assumed retirement age were the age of the member on actual retirement),
the member is entitled to a refund of the excess contributions.
(2) Where a refund is payable under this regulation, it must be paid together with interest.
Reduction of benefits
128P.—(1) This regulation applies where the administrators pay the whole or any part of the lifetime allowance charge arising on a benefit crystallisation event relating to the FPJABS in relation to a FPJABS member.
(2) The pensions or other benefits payable under this Part to or in respect of the FPJABS member may (notwithstanding any other provision of these Regulations) be reduced by such amount as, in accordance with normal actuarial practice, reflects the amount of the payments made.

Conversion of added years into added units of benefit
128R.—(1) Paragraphs (2) to (4) apply if, by virtue of Part 2A, a member who has purchased added years no longer has any offices in which the member has eligible service between 31st March 1995 and 1st April 2006 for which benefits are to be calculated under the post-1995 provisions.
(2) For each office in relation to which the member purchased added years, the number of added years that the member has purchased are converted into added units of benefit using the following formula—
where—
A is the sum of contributions made (whether by lump sum or periodic contributions)
B is the total sum of contributions potentially payable by the member (whether by lump sum or periodic contributions) up to the assumed retirement age
C is the number of added years that the member has contracted to purchase in relation to the office
D is the appropriate service credit figure determined by reference to the age of the member at the member’s last birthday at the date of transfer set out in the relevant table in Schedule 1 to the Judicial Pensions (Transfer Between Judicial Pension Schemes) Regulations 1995(5) (“the Transfer Regulations”)

(10) The following provisions apply as if the unretired FPJAYS member had included the variation referred to in their notice under paragraph (8) in the number of added years they said that they would like to purchase in their original notice under regulation 104(2)—
(a)
regulation 110(1)(a) (assumed contribution commencement date);

(13) An unretired FPJAYS member who has ceased to make periodic contributions may give a notice under paragraph (8) to vary the number of added years that they originally agreed to purchase but that notice has effect only if that member also makes an application under regulation 112(6) as modified by paragraph (14), which is accepted by the administrators.
(14) Regulation 112(6) applies in relation to a member of the description in paragraph (13) as if sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) were omitted.

128U.—(1) Paragraph (2) applies where an FPJAYS member entered into an agreement to purchase added years before the amendment day and as a result of—
(a)
the member’s reckonable service in eligible fee-paid office before 7 April 2000; or
(b)
an election by the member under section 40 of the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022,

(14) Regulation 126(7) applies in relation to a member of the description in paragraph (13) as if sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) were omitted.
Refund of JASAPS contributions when benefits calculated under pre-1995 provisions
128W.—(1) Paragraph (2) applies where a JASAPS member has entered into an agreement to purchase units of added surviving adult’s pension, and benefits for all of the member’s eligible fee-paid judicial offices are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions by virtue of Part 2A.
(2) The administrators must reduce the number of units of added surviving adult’s pension to nil and refund the member’s contributions together with interest.
Conversion of units of benefit into added years
128X.—(1) This regulation applies if, as a result of one or more elections under regulation 11C, an FPJABS member who has purchased added units of benefit no longer has any offices for which benefits are to be calculated under the pre-1995 provisions.
(2) The number of added units of benefit that the member has purchased are converted into added years using the following formula—
where—
A is the sum of contributions made (whether by lump sum or periodic contributions)
B is the total sum of contributions potentially payable by the member (whether by lump sum or periodic contributions) up to the assumed retirement age
C is the number of added units of benefit that the member has contracted to purchase
D is the appropriate service credit figure determined by reference to the age of the member at the member’s last birthday at the date of transfer set out in the relevant table in Schedule 1 to the Judicial Pensions (Transfer Between Judicial Pension Schemes) Regulations 1995 (“the Transfer Regulations”)
For the purpose of the definition of D, the relevant table in the Transfer Regulations is—
(i)
the Higher Judiciary Scheme for offices in Table 1 of Schedule 1,
(ii)
the Circuit Judiciary Scheme for offices in Table 2 of Schedule 1, and
(iii)
the Land Tribunal Scheme and District Judiciary Scheme for offices in Table 3 of Schedule 1
PRS post-1995 is obtained as the value of PRS under regulation 128B but as if every reference to the pre-1995 provisions were a reference to the post-1995 provisions.
(3) The number of added years determined under paragraph (2) are to be allocated to the eligible fee-paid judicial offices held by the member for which benefits are calculated under the post-1995 provisions, in the same proportion as the member’s existing reckonable service in those offices.
(4) The agreement with the member to purchase further added units of benefit in the FPJABS is cancelled and the member becomes a member of the FPJAYS.
(5) If the conversion under paragraph (2) would mean that the maximum number of added years that an FPJAYS member may purchase specified in regulation 106(2) would be exceeded, the conversion is limited to that maximum and the member is entitled to a refund in respect of contributions for any excess added units of benefit together with interest.”

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2 of these Regulations amends the Judicial Pensions (Fee-Paid Judges) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”) to allow fee-paid service prior to 7th April 2000 to count as reckonable service for the pension scheme constituted under those Regulations. Regulation 12 inserts two new Parts into the 2017 Regulations to provide for eligible fee-paid judicial office holders to have pension benefits calculated on a basis that mirrors the pension provisions under the Judicial Pensions Act 1981 that were available to salaried judges. Other provisions in Part 2 make consequential amendments including provision for the purchase of additional benefits by members of the scheme constituted under the 2017 Regulations.
Regulation 43 introduces a right to commutation of small pensions under the 2017 Regulations.
Regulation 66 replaces the Schedule to the 2017 Regulations, including insertion of a new Schedule 3 which consolidates the contributions rates which have been applicable for all periods of operation of the pension scheme under those Regulations.
Part 3 of these Regulations makes provision for entitlement to benefits arising from the amendments made by Part 2 before these Regulations have effect.
Part 4 of these Regulations deems persons who retired from judicial offices before 1st April 2017 and who were treated as if they were entitled to partial retirement under regulation 27 of the 2017 Regulations, as being so entitled. Consequently, pensions paid to such persons are not considered to have been overpaid or liable to recovery action.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

7th September 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Court Funds Rules 2011 (S.I. 2011/1734) (“the 2011 Rules”). The 2011 Rules relate to funds in court that are vested in the Accountant General under section 38 of the Administration of Justice Act 1982 (c. 53). The 2011 Rules govern the administration and management of funds in court by the Accountant General. These Rules amend the 2011 Rules for one main purpose, and make other more minor miscellaneous amendments.
Rules 3 to 7, 9, 11 to 19 to 21, 23 and 24 of these Rules make amendments to rules 3, 6 to 8, 12, 16, 17, 22 to 29, 39 and 41 of the 2011 Rules, and insert new rules 6A and 22A into the 2011 Rules, to enable deposits of funds into court, and payments out, to be made by electronic means.
The other amendments in these Rules reflect amendments to the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998/3132), amend the rules on when money must be paid into an interest-bearing account, amend the rules on payment of interest, update a court name and correct a typographical error.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

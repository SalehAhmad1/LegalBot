(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends regulation 19 (fit and proper persons employed) of the 2014 Regulations.
Regulation 19(3) of the 2014 Regulations, as read with regulation 8 of the 2014 Regulations, requires a registered person to make available, in relation to each person employed, the information specified in Schedule 3 to the 2014 Regulations. The reference to “each person employed” in regulation 19 of the 2014 Regulations includes a person employed under arrangements to provide their services voluntarily (see regulation 2(1) and 2(2) of the 2014 Regulations for the definition of “employment”).
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends regulation 19 of the 2014 Regulations for the purposes of specifying the information that a registered person must make available in relation to a person employed under arrangements to provide their services voluntarily (volunteers). Specifically, a registered person does not need to make available information relating to a volunteer’s full employment history as set out at paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 to the 2014 Regulations, unless it is a case to which regulation 4, 6 or 7 of the 2014 Regulations applies.
Regulation 4 of the 2014 Regulations sets out information requirements in relation to service providers where the service provider is an individual or partnership. Regulation 6 of the 2014 Regulations relates to requirements for service providers where an individual is employed as a director, manager or secretary of the service provider, and is responsible for supervising the management of the carrying on of the regulated activity of the service provider, where the service provider is a body other than a partnership. Regulation 7 of the 2014 Regulations sets out the requirements relating to registered managers.

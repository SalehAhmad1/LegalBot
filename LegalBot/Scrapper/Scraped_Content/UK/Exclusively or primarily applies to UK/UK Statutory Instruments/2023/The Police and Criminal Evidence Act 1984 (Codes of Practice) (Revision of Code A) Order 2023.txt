11th January 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into force a revised code of practice, Code A, under section 66(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (c. 60), which will supersede the existing code of practice issued under that subsection.
The amendments made by the revised code of practice bring searches made under section 342E (relating to individuals subject to a Serious Violence Reduction Order) of the Sentencing Act 2020 (c. 17) (“the Sentencing Code”) within the scope of Code A for the period specified in new Annex G of the Code. Serious Violence Reduction Orders, provision for which was inserted into the Sentencing Code by the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (c. 32) (“the 2022 Act”), are civil orders which confer power on the police to stop and search individuals convicted of an offence where a knife or offensive weapon was used or was present, without requiring prior reasonable grounds for suspicion. In accordance with the 2022 Act, these Orders will be subject to a pilot before a decision is taken as to whether to commence the provisions relating to such Orders in full for the whole of England and Wales. The revisions to Code A made by Annex G will therefore apply for a specified period of 30 months. This covers a 24-month pilot plus an additional 6-month transitional period.
The revised code of practice is published by the Stationery Office and copies may be obtained from its bookshops. The revised code of practice will also be available on the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 code of practice pages on the gov.uk website. The revised code is laid before Parliament with this Order. An impact assessment has been prepared in relation to the 2022 Act. A copy of the impact assessment is available on Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022: overarching documents - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk) . A hard copy can be obtained by writing to the Home Office at 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.

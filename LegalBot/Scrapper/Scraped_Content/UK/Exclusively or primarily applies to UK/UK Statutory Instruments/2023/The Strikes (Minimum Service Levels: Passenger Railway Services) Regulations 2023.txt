(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under section 234B and 234F of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (c. 52) (“the 1992 Act”). They specify, for the purposes of enabling work notices under section 234C of that Act to be given:
(a)
train operation services; and
(b)
railway infrastructure services,
as “relevant services”, and the levels of service in relation to strikes as respects those relevant services. Separate provision for the levels of service in relation to strikes on light rail systems is made.
Regulation 1(5) provides that these Regulations apply in relation to a strike where the strike ballot was held before the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act 2023 (c. 39) received Royal Assent or the notice of strike was received before these Regulations come into force. This is authorised by section 234B(2) of the 1992 Act.
A regulatory impact assessment has been published in relation to this instrument and is available from the Department for Transport, Great Minster House, 33 Horseferry Road, London SW1P 4DR, and is published alongside this instrument on https://www.legislation.gov.uk.

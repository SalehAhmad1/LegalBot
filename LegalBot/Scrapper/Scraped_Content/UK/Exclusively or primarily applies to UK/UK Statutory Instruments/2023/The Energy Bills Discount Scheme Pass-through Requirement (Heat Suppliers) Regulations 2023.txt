6.—(1) The amount which an intermediary must pass on to an end user under the pass-through requirement is an amount in pounds sterling or in pounds sterling per kWh of energy which comprises all of the scheme benefit, or if less than the amount of scheme benefit, a just and reasonable amount calculated in accordance with this regulation (“pass-through amount”).
(2) If the pass-through amount is less than the amount of scheme benefit, the intermediary must provide evidence to the end user showing what factors it took into account in determining that the pass-through amount was just and reasonable.
(3) In determining what is a just and reasonable pass-through amount, the intermediary may take account of—
(a)
the amount the intermediary paid for the energy in respect of which the scheme benefit was provided (“the input energy”);
(b)
other costs incurred by the intermediary in supplying heating or hot water to its end users in the period for which the scheme benefit was provided (“relevant period”);
(c)
any loss incurred where, as a result of a relevant change in the price of energy(1), the total amount charged to end users for the supply of heating and hot water in the relevant period is less than the amount paid for the total quantity of input energy; and
(d)
the extent to which its charges to end users reflect the increased costs of energy in response to the energy crisis.
(4) Subject to paragraph (3), a pass-through amount is just and reasonable where—
(a)
at the time the intermediary was provided with the scheme benefit, the intermediary was charging the end user either—
(i)
based on the proportion of the total quantity of input energy which the end user’s usage represented; or
(ii)
based on the proportion of the total amount paid by the intermediary for energy in a period which the amount paid by the end user for the supply of heating and hot water in that period represented; and
(b)
the intermediary calculates the pass-through amount for the end user on this basis.
(5) If paragraph (4) does not apply, the intermediary in determining what is a just and reasonable pass-through amount—
(a)
must apply the best available information to allocate the scheme benefit amongst end users; and
(b)
may take into account the basis on which the intermediary was allocating charges amongst end users at the time the intermediary was provided with the scheme benefit.
(6) The pass-through amount for a person who is an end user for part of a relevant period must be calculated only for that part of the relevant period for which they were an end user.
(7) In calculating a pass-through amount—
(a)
an intermediary is not required to pass on to its end users an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of scheme benefit provided to the intermediary over the scheme period;
(b)
an intermediary which is also an end user must not retain more of the scheme benefit for itself—
(i)
than is proportionate to its own end user’s usage; or
(ii)
than the proportion of the amount the intermediary paid for the total quantity of input energy that the intermediary itself bears (where it is not practicable to assess the quantity of its own end user’s usage); and
(c)
an intermediary may include the quantity of heating or hot water supplied to common areas in a building as part of its own end user’s usage if the intermediary was not charging end users for this as part of the arrangements in place at the time the intermediary was provided with the scheme benefit.
(8) Paragraph (9) or (10) apply where in a relevant period a scheme benefit has been provided to an intermediary and in the current period, as a result of a supply redetermination event, the intermediary is provided (under regulation 24 of the EBDS Regulations, or the NI EBDS Regulations or paragraph (9) or (10) of these Regulations) with an SRE adjustment.
(9) If the SRE adjustment is an increase in the amount of scheme benefit in respect of the relevant period, the intermediary must adjust the pass-through amount calculated under this regulation 6 in respect of the current period to pass on such increase in the amount to the original end user.
(10) If the SRE adjustment is a reduction in the amount of scheme benefit in respect of the relevant period, the intermediary may adjust the pass-through amount calculated under this regulation in respect of the current period by way of set-off to pass on such reduction in the amount to the original end user.
(11) Any adjustment of a pass-through amount made under paragraph (9) or (10) must be just and reasonable and calculated in the same way as the pass-through amount was calculated for the original end user in the relevant period.
(12) In this regulation—
“current period” means, in relation to a supply redetermination event, the billing period in which an intermediary is provided with an SRE adjustment;
“end user’s usage” means the total quantity of input energy in kWh used in a relevant period to supply heating and hot water to an end user in that period;
“original end user” means an end user to whom an intermediary effected a pass-through in respect of a relevant period;
“scheme period” has the meaning given in regulation 2 of the EBDS Regulations or the NI EBDS Regulations.

after subparagraph (b), there is inserted—
“(ba) provide clear information about how the pass-through amount has been calculated, how the intermediary has determined that the pass-through amount is just and reasonable, and must state the final reduction amount; and
(bb) if applicable, provide clear information about any adjustment that the intermediary intends to make to the pass-through amount notified under paragraph (ba) to effect a pass-through of an SRE adjustment;”; and
(ii)
after subparagraph (c), there is inserted—
“(ca) the information contained in the bill must include the amount the intermediary paid for the energy in respect of which the scheme benefit was provided and the amount charged to the end user.”.
(4) For the purposes of this regulation, Schedule 2 to the Metering and Billing Regulations applies, but is to be read as if paragraph 6 is omitted.Enforcement of pass-through requirement
8.—(1) Where an intermediary fails to comply with the pass-through requirement, the end user may—
(a)
recover the pass-through amount from the intermediary as a civil debt; and
(b)
claim interest to be paid by the intermediary on such amount at a rate of 2% per cent per annum over the Bank of England base rate from the date 60 days after the date on which the scheme benefit to which the pass-through requirement relates was provided to the intermediary.
(2) For the purposes of this regulation, the “Bank of England base rate” means—

24th April 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for the pass-through requirement in relation to the Energy Bills Discount Scheme (EBDS) in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The pass-through requirement is imposed on a person who supplies and charges for the supply of heating or hot water to an end user through a heat network using energy in respect of which the person has been provided a scheme benefit (“intermediary”). It requires the intermediary to pass on the benefits of the EBDS to its end users. The Regulations also deal with adjustments to pass-through amounts which may be needed if a supply redetermination event occurs under the EBDS Regulations or the NI EBDS Regulations.
Regulation 3 makes provision about energy price support provided by the EBDS. This is defined as a “scheme benefit”.
Regulation 4 requires an intermediary who has been provided with a scheme benefit to notify each of its end users in writing that it has been provided with the benefit.
Regulation 5 imposes a requirement on an intermediary to secure that a scheme benefit provided to it is passed on to its end users as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been provided with the scheme benefit. If not all of the scheme benefit is being passed on to the end users, intermediaries are required to pass on a just and reasonable amount of the benefit to each of its end users.
Regulation 6 defines “pass-through amount” and provides for methods of calculating the amount and determining what is a just and reasonable pass-through amount.
Regulation 7 requires intermediaries to provide billing information to end users.
Regulation 8 provides for the end user to recover unpaid pass-through amounts from the intermediary as a civil debt.
Regulation 9 establishes a consumer redress scheme in England and Wales and Scotland for end users of intermediaries.
Regulation 10 provides for enforcement of the requirement to be a member of the redress scheme.
Regulation 11 provides for the investigation of complaints relating to the operation of these Regulations in Northern Ireland by the General Consumer Council of Northern Ireland.
Regulation 12 disapplies the requirement to consult on guidance on civil sanctions to be issued by an authorised person under the Heat Network (Metering and Billing) Regulations 2014.
A full impact assessment of the effect of EBDS, including the related pass-through requirements, will have on the costs of business and the voluntary sector is available from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, 1 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0ET and is published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside the instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk

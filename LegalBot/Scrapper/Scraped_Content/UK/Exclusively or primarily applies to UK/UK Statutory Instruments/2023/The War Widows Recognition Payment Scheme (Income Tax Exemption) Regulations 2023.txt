8th November 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
These Regulations provide for an exemption from income tax with retrospective effect for War Widows Recognition Payment Scheme payments.
Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2020 provides for exemptions and relief from tax in respect of qualifying payments. Under paragraph 2(5) of that Schedule the Treasury may by regulations specify compensation payments made by a public authority or by or on behalf of the United Kingdom government to be qualifying payments. Paragraph 3 of the Schedule provides for an exemption from income tax in respect of a receipt of a qualifying payment.
Regulation 2 specifies that War Widows Recognition Payment Scheme payments are qualifying payments for the purposes of paragraph 3 of Schedule 15 to the Finance Act 2020. This means there is no liability to income tax arising from payments under the scheme received on or after 1st October 2023.
War Widows Recognition payments are made by the Ministry of Defence to those who forfeited their entitlement to a pension or allowance for a service attributable death prior to 2015 and have not had this pension or allowance restored through divorce or subsequent bereavement and are not eligible to make an application to restore the pension or allowance.

28th February 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring specified provisions of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (c. 32) (“the Act”) into force.
Regulation 2 brings into force on 7th March 2023 sections 60 and 61 of the Act (non-criminal hate incidents), which make provision for the Secretary of State to issue a code of practice about the processing of personal data by a member of a police force, or other relevant persons, relating to non-criminal hate incidents.
Section 34 of the Act requires the provisions of Chapter 2 of Part 2 (Offensive Weapons Homicide Reviews) to be brought into force for the purposes of a pilot (for one or more specified purposes or in relation to one or more specified areas in England and Wales), and for the Secretary of State to lay a report before Parliament on the operation of those provisions, before the relevant provisions may be brought fully into force in England and Wales.
Regulation 3 establishes a pilot of Offensive Weapons Homicide Reviews (“OWHR”) by bringing into force, on 1st April 2023, relevant provisions of Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the Act in relation to relevant deaths (occurring during the pilot period) and for the purposes of the pilot partners only (being the review partners for the pilot areas) for the pilot period (being 9 months, beginning with 1st April 2023). The provisions apply to pilot partners for the police area of South Wales, the areas of the London borough councils of Barnet, Brent, Harrow, Lambeth and Southwark and the areas of Birmingham city council and Coventry city council (the pilot areas). Limited provisions are brought into force on 1st April 2023 across England and Wales for the pilot period to enable OWHRs to be carried out effectively, such as to enable information to be requested from persons for the purpose of reviews and for the Secretary of State to publish OWHR reports.
Regulation 4 provides that, where, before the end of the pilot period, a review partner starts an OWHR or is aware of qualifying circumstances in relation to a person’s death (and is not aware that the duty to arrange a review does not apply or has not notified the Secretary of State that they are not under a duty to arrange a review), the relevant provisions of Chapter 2 of Part 2 of the Act continue in effect in relation to that person’s death. This ensures that such OWHRs are completed.
An impact assessment has been prepared in relation to the OWHR measures in the Act. A copy of the impact assessment is available on: https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/42136/documents/489. A hard copy can be obtained by writing to the Firearms Policy Unit of the Home Office at 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT REGULATIONS

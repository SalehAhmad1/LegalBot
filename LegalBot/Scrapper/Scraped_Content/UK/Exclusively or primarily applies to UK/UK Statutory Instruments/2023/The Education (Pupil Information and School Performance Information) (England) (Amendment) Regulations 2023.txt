(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Pupil Information) (England) Regulations 2005 (the “Pupil Information Regulations”) and the Education (School Performance Information) (England) Regulations 2007 (the “School Performance Information Regulations”). The amendments in these Regulations are in consequence of amendments being made to the Education (National Curriculum) (Key Stage 1 Assessment Arrangements) (England) Order 2004 (the “Key Stage 1 Order”), to remove the statutory requirement for schools to carry out national curriculum assessments at the end of the first key stage.
The Pupil Information Regulations require the provision of information by governing bodies and head teachers of maintained schools about the educational achievements of their pupils. They also make provision for the transfer of information (the “common transfer file”) when a pupil moves from a maintained school to another school. Regulations 3 to 6 of these Regulations amend Schedules 1 and 2 to the Pupil Information Regulations and also make a minor correction to remove a redundant definition from regulation 2. The amendments to Schedule 1 remove requirements to include information on the results of national curriculum assessments at the end of the first key stage in the head teacher’s annual report. The amendments to Schedule 2 provide that, if a pupil completes the first key stage in or after the 2023/24 school year, a common transfer file for that pupil will no longer need to include results of teacher assessments at the end of the first key stage (or, in the case of pupils with special educational needs, their cumulative achievements in education at the end of the first key stage). Where a pupil has completed national curriculum assessments under the Key Stage 1 Order up to and including the 2022/23 school year, a common transfer file for that pupil will still need to include the results of those assessments.
The School Performance Information Regulations relate to the collection and publication of information about school performance. Regulation 7 of these Regulations amends regulation 5 of and Schedule 1 to the School Performance Information Regulations, to remove the requirement for governing bodies of maintained schools to provide information to local authorities about assessment results at the end of the first key stage.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules are made under section 53(1)(c) of the Firearms Act 1968 (c. 27) (“the 1968 Act”) and extend to England and Wales.
Rule 2(1) sets out the minimum storage requirements for an air weapon to comply with section 24ZA(1) of the 1968 Act. Section 24ZA of the 1968 Act provides that it is an offence for a person in possession of an air weapon to fail to take reasonable precautions to prevent a minor from having the weapon.
The effect of rule 2(2) is that these Rules do not apply to an air weapon when it is a rifle from which a shot, bullet or other missile, with a kinetic energy of more than 13,600 joules at the muzzle of the weapon, can be discharged.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument. There was, however, an impact assessment prepared to support the Government’s response to the consultation which ended on 16 February 2021 on the access of air weapons by those under the age of 18.

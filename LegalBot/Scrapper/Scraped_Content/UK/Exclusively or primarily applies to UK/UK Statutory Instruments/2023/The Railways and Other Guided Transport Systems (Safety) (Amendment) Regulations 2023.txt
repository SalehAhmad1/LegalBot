11th May 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/599) (“ROGS”).
Amendments are being made to ROGS to correct earlier errors identified by the Department of Transport. These corrections are to be found in regulation 3(2) and regulations and 3(5) respectively.
Regulation 3(3) amends ROGS in order to end the use of EU-issued certificates for entities in charge of maintenance (“ECM”) responsible for freight wagons in domestic traffic in Great Britain. ECMs responsible for freight wagons operating on the domestic network will be required to have UK issued ECM certificates. This will ensure proper supervision of these freight wagons that run on the domestic network as the Office of Rail and Road will have enforcement powers in respect of UK issued ECM certificates. Regulation 3(4) removes a requirement for ECM certification bodies to follow the EU sectoral accreditation scheme.

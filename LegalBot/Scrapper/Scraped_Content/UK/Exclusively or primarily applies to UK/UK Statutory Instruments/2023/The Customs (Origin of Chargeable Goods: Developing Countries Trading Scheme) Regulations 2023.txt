If originating goods exported from a qualifying DCTS country (“the exporting country”) to another country or territory (“the importing country”) have been returned to the exporting country, they are to be regarded as not originating from the exporting country unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of an HMRC officer that the returned goods—
(a)
are the same as those which were exported, and
(b)
have not undergone any operations beyond those necessary to preserve their condition while in a country other than the exporting country or during transportation.Non-manipulation requirements in relation to goods
24.—(1) The requirements mentioned in regulation 4(e) are that the goods must, at the declaration acceptance date—
(a)
be the same goods as were exported from the qualifying DCTS country,
(b)
not have been altered or transformed in any way after being exported from the qualifying DCTS country, and
(c)
not have been subjected to any operation after being exported from the qualifying DCTS country other than—
(i)
unloading, reloading, splitting, separation from bulk, storing, bottling, or any operation necessary to preserve them in good condition, or
(ii)
the adding or affixing of marks, labels, seals or any other documentation to ensure compliance with legal requirements applicable in any part of the United Kingdom.
(2) Where goods are imported into a qualifying DCTS country for the purpose of bilateral, intra-regional, inter-regional or extended cumulation under regulation 17, 18, 19, 20 or 21 respectively, they must—
(a)
be the same goods as were exported from the country or territory from which they originate,
(b)
not have been altered or transformed in any way, and
(c)
not have been subjected to any operation other than to preserve their condition.
(3) Goods may be stored, and consignments split up by or on behalf of the exporter, in a transit country or territory provided the goods are at all times under customs supervision in the transit country or territory.
(4) To enable an HMRC officer to verify that the requirements set out in paragraphs (1) to (3) have been met, the declarant must, if required, provide relevant evidence including any contractual transport documents (including bills of lading), evidence based on the marking or numbering of packages and other evidence related to the goods themselves.Accounting segregation of exporters’ stocks of fungible materials
25.—(1) If fungible originating materials and fungible non-originating materials are used in the processing of goods, HMRC may, at the written request of an exporter established in the United Kingdom, authorise the management of the materials in the United Kingdom using the accounting segregation method for the purpose of subsequent export to a qualifying DCTS country within the framework of bilateral cumulation, without keeping the materials on separate stocks.
(2) HMRC may make the granting of the authorisation referred to in paragraph (1) subject to any conditions HMRC deem appropriate but may grant it only if, by use of the method referred to in paragraph (1), it can be ensured that, at any time, the quantity of goods obtained which could be regarded as originating from the United Kingdom is the same as the quantity that would have been obtained by using a method of physical segregation of the stocks.
(3) If authorised, the method referred to in paragraph (1) must be applied, and its application recorded, on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the United Kingdom.
(4) In paragraph (1)—
“bilateral cumulation” has the meaning given in regulation 17(4);
“fungible” means, in relation to materials, materials which, once incorporated into the finished goods—
(a)
are of the same kind and commercial quality,
(b)
have the same technical and physical characteristics, and
(c)
cannot be distinguished from each other.Stuart Anderson

SCHEDULE 1
Conditions which must be met for the processing of goods to constitute an important stage of manufacture
PART 1
Introductory notes
Note 1 – The structure of the tables in Part 2 and Part 3 of this Schedule
1.1.  Where the entry in Column 1 is prefixed by ‘ex’, the condition in Column 3 applies only to the part of that Chapter, heading or sub-heading as described in Column 2.
1.2.  Where several headings or sub-headings are grouped together in Column 1 or a Chapter number is given and the description of goods in Column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the corresponding condition in Column 3 applies to all goods which are classified in headings of the Chapter or in any of the headings or sub-headings grouped together in Column 1.
1.3.  Where there are different conditions in the table applying to different goods within a heading, each row contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the corresponding condition in Column 3.
1.4.  The conditions set out in the table in Part 2 apply to LDCs. The conditions set out in the table in Part 3 are applicable to all other qualifying DCTS countries and are also applicable to exports from the British Islands, a British overseas territory, the European Union, Norway or Switzerland to a qualifying DCTS country for the purposes of bilateral cumulation under regulation 17 of these Regulations.
1.5.  Where a condition specifies that a good must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does not prevent the use also of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot meet the condition.
Note 2 – General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods
2.1.  Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which are grown or harvested in a qualifying DCTS country are to be treated as originating from that country, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from another country or territory.
2.2.  In cases where the content of non-originating material in a good is sugar and is subject to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 and 1702 used in the manufacture of the final good and used in the manufacture of the non-originating materials incorporated in the final good is taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.
Note 3 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile goods
3.1.  The term “natural fibres” as used in the tables refers to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed but which have not been spun. The term includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203 and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.
3.2.  The terms “textile pulp”, “chemical materials” and “paper-making materials” as used in the tables describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63 which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.
3.3.  The term “man-made staple fibres” as used in the tables refers to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.
Note 4 - Tolerances applicable to goods made of a mixture of textile materials
4.1.  Where, in relation to a good in the table in Part 2 or 3, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in Column 3 are not required to be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of the good and which, taken together, represent 10% or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used (see also Notes 4.3 and 4.4).
4.2.  However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 4.1 may be applied only to mixed goods which have been made from two or more basic textile materials. The following are the basic textile materials:
silk;
wool;
coarse animal hair;
fine animal hair;
horsehair;
cotton;
paper-making materials and paper;
flax;
true hemp;
jute and other textile bast fibres;
sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;
coconut, abaca, ramie, and other vegetable textile fibres;
synthetic man-made filaments;
artificial man-made filaments;
current-conducting filaments;
synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;
synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;
synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;
synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;
synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;
synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;
synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);
synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);
other synthetic man-made staple fibres;
artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;
other artificial man-made staple fibres;
yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped;
yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped;
goods of heading 5605 incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;
other goods of heading 5605;
glass fibres;
metal fibres.
Example:
A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating materials which are synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the conditions may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the yarn.
Example:
A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the conditions, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the conditions, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the fabric.
4.3.  In the case of goods incorporating “yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped”, the tolerance is 20% in respect of this yarn.
4.4.  In the case of goods incorporating “strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film”, the tolerance is 30% in respect of this strip.
Note 5 — Other tolerances applicable to certain textile goods
5.1.  Where, in the table in Part 2 or 3, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy the condition set out in Column 3 for the made-up good concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the good and that their value does not exceed 8% of the ex-works price of the good.
5.2.  Without prejudice to Note 5.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile goods, whether or not they contain textiles.
Example:
If a condition in the tables provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.
5.3.  Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.
Note 6— Definitions of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain goods of Chapter 27
6.1.  For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, the “specific processes” are the following:
vacuum-distillation;
redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;
cracking;
reforming;
extraction by means of selective solvents;
the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;
polymerisation;
alkylation;
isomerisation.
6.2.  For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the “specific processes” are the following:
vacuum-distillation;
redistillation by a very thorough fractionation-process;
cracking;
reforming;
extraction by means of selective solvents;
the process comprising all of the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralisation with alkaline agents; decolourisation and purification with naturally-active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite;
polymerisation;
alkylation;
isomerisation;
in respect of heavy oils of heading 2710 only, desulphurisation with hydrogen, resulting in a reduction of at least 85% of the sulphur-content of the goods processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method(1));
in respect of goods of heading 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering;
in respect of heavy oils of heading 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen, at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C, with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurisation, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction. However, the further treatment, with hydrogen, of lubricating oils of heading 2710 (e.g. hydrofinishing or decolourisation), in order, more especially, to improve colour or stability is not to be deemed to be a specific process;
in respect of fuel oils of heading 2710 only, atmospheric distillation, on condition that less than 30% of these goods distils, by volume, including losses, at 300 °C, by the ASTM D 86 method(2);
in respect of heavy oils other than gas oils and fuel oils of heading 2710 only, treatment by means of a high-frequency electrical brush-discharge;
in respect of crude goods (other than petroleum jelly, ozokerite, lignite wax or peat wax, paraffin wax containing by weight less than 0.75% of oil) of heading 2712 only, de-oiling by fractional crystallisation.
6.3.  For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water-separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur-content as a result of mixing goods with different sulphur-contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not constitute an important stage of manufacture.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace the Customs (Origin of Chargeable Goods: Trade Preference Scheme) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1346). Regulation 4 sets out the conditions under which chargeable goods are to be regarded as originating from a country or territory under section 17, and for the purposes of Part 1, of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (c. 22) (“the Act”).
Regulation 4 sets the conditions that determine whether a good is originating from a “qualifying DCTS country”, namely an eligible developing country to which one or more of the Developing Countries Trading Scheme frameworks specified in Part 3 of the Trade Preference Scheme (Developing Countries Trading Scheme) Regulations (S.I. 2023/561) (“the DCTS Regulations”) apply. The conditions are that the goods are wholly obtained in that qualifying DCTS country or, where the goods are obtained in two or more countries or territories, that it is the last country or territory in which processing of the goods constitutes an important stage of manufacture (for which regulation 8 makes further provision); and that the requirements in regulations 5, 24(1) and (4) and, in the case of returned goods, 23 are met (see further below). The conditions which must be met for the processing to constitute an important stage of manufacture are set out in the tables in Part 2 and Part 3 of Schedule 1. The conditions in Part 2 are applicable to least developed countries and the conditions in Part 3 are applicable to all other qualifying DCTS countries.
Regulation 5 provides for the evidence required for goods to be regarded as originating from a qualifying DCTS country. Regulation 6 provides for the notices which HMRC Commissioners may give relating to the provision and verification of evidence of the origin of goods and the arrangements and obligations applicable to an exporter.
Regulation 7 specifies cases in which goods are to be regarded as wholly obtained in a country or territory. Regulation 8 sets out the circumstances in which the processing of goods constitutes an important stage of manufacture by reference to the conditions that must be met as set out in Schedule 1, and the circumstances in which it does not. Regulation 9 defines value, in relation to a material. Regulation 10 provides for the method by which the average ex-works price charged for goods sold, and the average value of non-originating materials used, may be calculated where the conditions specified in the tables in Part 2 and Part 3 of Schedule 1 refer to a maximum content of such materials. Regulation 11 provides for a derogation relating to the use of certain materials up to defined weight, price and percentage maxima, in determining under the tables in Part 2 and Part 3 of Schedule 1 whether the processing constitutes an important stage of manufacture.
Regulation 12 provides for the circumstances in which identical goods in a consignment must be taken into account individually and packaging must be included in determining the origin of the goods. Regulation 13 provides for the circumstances in which accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with the goods to which they relate are to be regarded as having the same origin as those goods. Regulation 14 provides for the circumstances in which goods in a set are to be regarded as originating from a qualifying DCTS country. Regulation 15 sets out elements used to process, or in the processing of, goods which are to be disregarded in determining their origin. Regulation 16 provides for the grounds on which the Secretary of State may grant a temporary derogation to a country in respect of specified goods and makes further provision relating to the derogation.
Regulations 17 to 21 make provision relating to different types of cumulation which is the system whereby goods originating from a specified country, or from the British Islands, a British overseas territory (except Gibraltar and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia), the European Union, Norway or Switzerland in the case of cumulation under regulation 17, are to be regarded as originating from a qualifying DCTS country when incorporated into goods manufactured in that qualifying DCTS country. Regulations 18 and 19 provide for the two types of cumulation, intra-regional and inter-regional, between qualifying DCTS countries in, respectively, the same regional group and different regional groups. Regulation 18 also provides for cumulation with goods originating from an FTA partner country in the same regional group. Schedule 3 sets out regional groups for this purpose. Regulation 21 provides for cumulation between least developed countries and, respectively, eligible DCTS countries and the Economic Partnership Agreement countries set out in Schedule 4.
Regulation 22 provides for the grounds on which the Secretary of State may vary product specific rules in respect of specified goods. Regulation 23 sets out further requirements relating to goods returned to the exporting country or territory and regulation 24 sets out non-manipulation requirements that must be met to satisfy the conditions under regulation 4 for chargeable goods to be regarded as originating from a qualifying DCTS country. Regulation 25 makes provision for the authorisation of the management of exporters’ stocks of fungible materials (as defined in that regulation) using the accounting segregation method.

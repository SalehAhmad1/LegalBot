displays that are scheduled to take place there on 12th August 2023 and 13th August 2023. 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the 
Civil Aviation Authority and Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in the 
vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST).

display director may be contacted as notified.

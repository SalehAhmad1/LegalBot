(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 52 of the Transport and Works Act 1992 allows the operator of a railway or tramway that is crossed by a private road or private path to cause or permit the placement near the crossing of crossing signs or barriers that are prescribed in regulations made by the Secretary of State, or as otherwise authorised by the Secretary of State.
These Regulations prescribe crossing signs and barriers which may be placed on or near a private road or private path at or near the crossing as provided for in that section.

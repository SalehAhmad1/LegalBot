(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order specifies Class A drugs for the purposes of Part 3 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 (c. 43) (“the 2000 Act”).
Article 2 specifies the Class A drugs for which offenders who are subject to a drug testing licence condition, upon release from prison, can be tested (under section 64 of the 2000 Act). Specifically, the substances and products specified in paragraphs 1 to 5 of Part 1 (Class A drugs) of Schedule 2 to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (c. 38), on the date this order enters into force (2nd August 2023), are “specified Class A drugs” for that purpose.
Additionally, as a consequence of other legislation relying on the definition of “specified Class A drug” in Part 3 of the 2000 Act, Article 2 also has the effect of setting out the Class A drugs for which:
testing in police detention may be carried out (under section 63B of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (c. 60)),
persons may be required to attend assessments of their drug misuse following testing in police detention (under Part 3 of the Drugs Act 2005 (c. 17)),
persons may be required to attend an assessment and/or follow up assessment relating to their drug dependency or misuse as a condition of bail (under section 3(6D) of the Bail Act 1976 (c. 63)),
pre-sentence drug testing requirements may be imposed (under section 34A of the Sentencing Act 2020 (c. 17) (which is not yet commenced)),
offenders may be tested when they are subject to post sentence supervision requirements (under section 256D of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44)); and
testing measures which may be imposed in respect of Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure subjects (under paragraph 10ZB of Schedule 1 to the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011 (c. 23)).
Article 3 of this Order revokes the Criminal Justice (Specified Class A Drugs) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/1816), the provisions of which are re-enacted, with amendments, by this Order.

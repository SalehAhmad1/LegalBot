3rd July 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 15 and 50 of the Agriculture Act 2020 (c. 21) in order to close to English producer organisations the Fruit and Vegetables Aid Scheme established by and under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (“the CMO”).
Regulation 2 modifies the CMO in relation to operational programmes implemented, or to be implemented, by producer organisations (or associations of producer organisations) which have their head office located in England at the relevant time. Articles 14A and 21A of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/891 make provision regarding the location of the head office of a producer organisation and an association of producer organisations respectively. The effects of the modification are that these operational programmes can have a duration of up to seven years and the relevant authority (the Rural Payments Agency) must not approve any new such operational programme to commence on or after 1 January 2024.
Regulation 3 modifies Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/891 as it applies to the same producer organisations and their operational programmes. The effect of the modifications is that there can be no amendment to the duration of these operational programmes which would result in the programme ending on or after 1 January 2026. A modification is made to Article 31(6) consequential to the modifications in regulations 2(2) and 3(3).
A full impact assessment has not been published for this instrument as it has no, or minimal, impact on the private sector, the voluntary sector or civil society organisations.

(2) If on the last review by the First-tier Tribunal of a national disqualification, the optometrist or ophthalmic medical practitioner was unsuccessful, and the First-tier Tribunal states that it is of the opinion that there is no realistic prospect of a further review being successful if held within a period of 3 years beginning with the date of its decision on that review, the reference to “one year” in section 115(8)(b) of the Act must be read as a reference to 3 years.
(3) If the First-tier Tribunal states that it is of the opinion that because a criminal conviction considered by the First-tier Tribunal in reaching its decision has been quashed or the penalty reduced on appeal, there is a need for an immediate review, the references to “two years” and “one year” in section 115(8) of the Act must be read as references to the period that has already elapsed.
(4) If the First-tier Tribunal is of the opinion that because the decision of a licensing, regulatory, or other body has been quashed or the penalty reduced on appeal, there is a need for an immediate review, the references to “two years” and “one year” in section 115(8) of the Act must be read as references to the period that has already elapsed.The Statement

(4) The Statement may provide for payments to be paid in respect of a period beginning with a date earlier than the date of the Statement only if doing so is not detrimental to the persons to whose remuneration it relates.

(4) The Welsh Ministers’ determination may include provision that payments in accordance with the determination must not exceed a specified amount in any specified period.
(5) The determination must provide for a deduction to take account of any payments which the suspended qualified practitioner receives for providing primary ophthalmic services otherwise than as a principal.
(6) Determinations may be varied or revoked by subsequent determinations.

(a)
has held—
(i)
an appointment in the health service, otherwise than under Part 4 of the National Health Service Act 1946(1), Part 2 of the National Health Service Act 1977(2), or Part 6 of the Act, with the status of consultant ophthalmologist, or

(ii)
held one or more ophthalmic appointments in an approved ophthalmic hospital for a period totalling 2 years or more, which must include tenure for at least 6 months of a residential appointment or an appointment with duties comparable with those of a residential appointment.
(2) The tenure for 6 months of a residential or comparable appointment referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(b)(ii) is not required in the case of a medical practitioner who has been fully registered for at least 7 years and whose experience is such as to make that requirement unnecessary.
(3) In this paragraph, “approved” means approved by the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee or by an appeal committee under paragraph 3.
Approval of qualifications of ophthalmic medical practitioners
2.—(1) A medical practitioner who wishes to be recognised as an ophthalmic medical practitioner must apply to the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee for its approval of that person’s qualifications and must give to the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee such particulars of those qualifications as the Committee may require.
(2) The Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee must consider and determine that applicant’s application and within 2 months beginning with the date of the application must inform that applicant of its determination.
(3) If the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee is satisfied that the applicant possesses the qualifications prescribed by paragraph 1, the applicant must be considered an ophthalmic medical practitioner.
(4) Despite paragraph 1 and sub-paragraph (1), a medical practitioner who has the prescribed qualifications for the purposes of providing general ophthalmic services in Northern Ireland under the Health and Personal Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972, in Scotland under the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978, or in England under the National Health Service Act 2006, must be considered an ophthalmic medical practitioner.
(5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2), the date of the application is the later of—
(a)
the date on which a completed application with all necessary supporting information is received by the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee, or
(b)
if the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee requires any further supporting particulars from the applicant, the date on which the Committee receives all the particulars that it requires.
Appeals from Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee
3.—(1) Any person (“an appellant”) dissatisfied with a determination of the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee that the appellant is not qualified to be an ophthalmic medical practitioner may, within 1 month beginning with the date on which the appellant received notice of that determination, or such longer period as the Welsh Ministers may at any time allow, appeal against the determination by sending to the Welsh Ministers a notice of appeal stating the facts and contentions on which the appellant relies.
(2) The Welsh Ministers must—
(a)
appoint to determine the appeal an appeal committee of 5 persons of whom at least 3 must be appointed after consultation with such bodies or organisations representing medical practitioners as appear to the Welsh Ministers to be concerned with the issues relating to qualification as an ophthalmic medical practitioner,
(b)
refer the appeal to that appeal committee,
(c)
send a copy of the notice of appeal to the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee and to such other persons as appear to the Welsh Ministers to be interested in the appeal, and
(d)
inform the appellant, the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee and any such other persons that the appeal has been referred to an appeal committee and of the address to which communications to the appeal committee must be sent.
(3) The appeal committee may, and if requested to do so by the appellant or the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee must, hold a hearing in connection with an appeal at such time and place as it may direct.
(4) Notice of the hearing must, at least 14 clear days before the date of the hearing, be sent by recorded delivery service to the appellant, the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee and any other person to whom the Welsh Ministers have under sub-paragraph (2) sent notice of the appeal.
(5) Either the appellant or the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee may within 1 month of being informed that the appeal has been referred to an appeal committee, or of being informed that a hearing of the appeal will be held, give notice that they wish to appear before the appeal committee.
(6) Any party to an appeal is entitled to appear and be heard by counsel or a solicitor and—
(a)
the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee is entitled to appear by a member or by their clerk or other officer duly appointed for the purpose;
(b)
the appellant is entitled to appear in person, by any member of the appellant’s family, by any friend, or by any officer or member of any organisation of which the appellant is a member.
(7) An appeal committee is to have all the powers of the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee, including in particular the power of approval, and if satisfied that an appellant possesses the qualifications and experience prescribed by paragraph 1, it must give that approval.
(8) The appeal committee must as soon as practicable notify its determination to the appellant, the Ophthalmic Qualifications Committee, the Welsh Ministers and any other person to whom the Welsh Ministers have sent notice of the appeal under paragraph (2).
(9) Subject to the other provisions in this paragraph, the appeal committee may set the procedure of the appeal as it considers proper.

the qualified practitioner is the subject of a national disqualification;
(c)
the qualified practitioner has not provided further information under regulation 15(5);

the Local Health Board is not satisfied of the qualified practitioner’s intention to provide or assist in the provision of primary ophthalmic services (as the case may be) in the Local Health Board’s area;
(f)
the qualified practitioner—
(i)
applies to be included in the ophthalmic list, but is included in the supplementary list of any Local Health Board, or

(g)
except in relation to a student optometrist, the Local Health Board considers that the qualified practitioner is not qualified to provide, or assist in the provision of, primary ophthalmic services (as appropriate);
(h)
in relation to a student optometrist, the Local Health Board considers that the person is not qualified to assist in the provision of services under supervision.
9.  The grounds on which a Local Health Board may refuse to include a qualified practitioner in its combined list are that—

the Local Health Board, having reviewed the qualified practitioner’s application and any other relevant information or documents, considers the qualified practitioner is unsuitable to be included in its combined list;

the Local Health Board, having checked the information provided by the qualified practitioner, is not satisfied with the information provided in the qualified practitioner’s application;

the Local Health Board considers that there are reasonable grounds for concluding that including the qualified practitioner in the combined list would be prejudicial to the efficiency of the services which the qualified practitioner would provide or assist with;
(f)
having checked with the Welsh Ministers for any facts that they consider relevant relating to past or current investigations or proceedings involving or relating to the qualified practitioner and, having considered these and any other facts in its possession involving or relating to the qualified practitioner, the Local Health Board considers that these justify such refusal;
(g)
on or after 30 July 2002 in the case of the ophthalmic list, or on or after 1 February 2006 in the case of the supplementary list, the qualified practitioner has been convicted in the United Kingdom of any criminal offence (other than murder) and has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment (whether suspended or not) of over 6 months.

the relevance of any offence, investigation or incident in respect of the qualified practitioner’s provision of (or assistance in providing, as applicable) primary ophthalmic services and any likely risk to any patients or to public finances;

(h)
whether the qualified practitioner is, has in the preceding 6 months been, or was at the time of the originating events, a director of a body corporate which was refused admission to, conditionally included in, removed or contingently removed from a primary care list or equivalent list or is currently suspended from any such list, and if so, what the facts were in each such case and the reasons given by the Local Health Board or equivalent body in each case for such action;
(i)
in the case of a corporate optician, whether any of its directors, or anyone who has in the preceding 6 months been one of its directors, has been refused admittance to, conditionally included in, removed, contingently removed or suspended from a primary care list, or equivalent list and, if so, the facts relating to the matter which led to such action and the reasons given by the Local Health Board or equivalent body for such action.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for arrangements in relation to primary ophthalmic services under the National Health Service in Wales. They supersede, consolidate and revoke previous Regulations.
The Regulations in large part replicate the provisions of the revoked Regulations in relation to the arrangements to be made by Local Health Boards for general ophthalmic services (sight tests).
In addition to the provisions about general ophthalmic services, the Regulations require Local Health Boards to also make arrangements for the provision of eye examination services under the National Health Service in Wales. General ophthalmic services and the eye examination services are collectively referred to in the Regulations as “primary ophthalmic services”.
Part 2 of the Regulations defines primary ophthalmic services and places a duty on Local Health Boards to arrange for the provision of eye examination services in their area.
Part 3 of the Regulations (and Schedule 1) makes provision in relation to general ophthalmic services, including setting out who is eligible to receive general ophthalmic services.
Part 4 of the Regulations (and Schedules 2 and 3) makes provision requiring each Local Health Board to maintain a combined list (comprised of the ophthalmic and supplementary lists), and provision about the qualification of ophthalmic medical practitioners. The “ophthalmic list” is a list of contractors that provide primary ophthalmic services in the Local Health Board’s area and the “supplementary list” is a list of the persons approved by the Local Health Board for the purpose of assisting in the provision of primary ophthalmic services. The Regulations require those registered with the General Optical Council as student optometrists to be included in a combined list before they may be employed to assist in the provision of primary ophthalmic services.
Part 5 of the Regulations (and Schedule 4) makes provision about arrangements with qualified practitioners for the provision of primary ophthalmic services.
Part 6 of the Regulations makes miscellaneous provision including in relation to the disclosure and publication of information, and the service of documents.
Part 7 of the Regulations (and Schedules 5, 6 and 7) makes consequential, revocation, transitional and saving provisions.

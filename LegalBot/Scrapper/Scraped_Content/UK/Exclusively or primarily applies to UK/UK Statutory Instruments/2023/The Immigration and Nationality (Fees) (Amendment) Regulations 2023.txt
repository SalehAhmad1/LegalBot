21st March 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/330) (“the principal Regulations”) which set fees for the exercise of various functions in connection with immigration and nationality.
In Part 2—
regulation 3 makes changes to certain definitions consequential on to the amendments made by regulation 6 which makes changes to the fees in respect of applications for entry clearance to the Isle of Man;
regulation 4(2) specifies the fee payable for applications made under Appendix Child joining a Non-Parent Relative (Protection) to the immigration rules;
regulations 4(3) and 5(2) remove fees for applications which are no longer provided for by the United Kingdom immigration rules;
regulations 4(4) and 5(3) clarify the fee payable respectively by a dependant who applies for entry clearance or leave to remain but not at the same time as the main applicant makes those applications.
Part 3 sets fees for applications—
for entry clearance to enter and limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom under Appendix Innovator Founder to the United Kingdom immigration rules. Appendix Innovator Founder has replaced Appendix Innovator in those rules. Part 6 makes related savings. Regulations 8(4) and 9(5) provide exceptions from these new fees;
for endorsement, by an endorsing body, of an application to be licensed by the Secretary of State as a sponsor in respect of the Scale-up route provided for by Appendix Scale-up to the United Kingdom immigration rules.
for an approval letter from an endorsing body in respect of a proposed application for entry clearance to enter, or leave to remain in, the United Kingdom under Appendix Innovator Founder to the United Kingdom immigration rules.
Part 4 specifies the fee payable in respect of applications made under the Appendix Adult Dependant Relative to the United Kingdom immigration rules.
Part 5 specifies the fee payable in respect of applications made under the Appendix Youth Mobility Scheme to the United Kingdom immigration rules.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations because no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

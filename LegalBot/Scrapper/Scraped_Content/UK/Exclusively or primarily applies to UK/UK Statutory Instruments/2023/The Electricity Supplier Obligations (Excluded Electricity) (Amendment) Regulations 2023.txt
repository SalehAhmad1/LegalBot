(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Electricity Supplier Obligations (Amendment & Excluded Electricity) Regulations 2015 to allow reduced levels of accounting information to be submitted by new companies that are applying for an EII certificate. The amendments also allow certain applicants for EII certificates flexibility in the accounting information they are required to submit where their businesses have been disrupted by the Covid 19 pandemic. The amendments allow such applicants to choose any 3 years of the preceding 5 years that accounts are available rather than being required to rely on the last 3 years to establish that they qualify for an EII certificate.
A full impact assessment has not been published for this instrument as it has minimal impact on the private sector and the voluntary sector.

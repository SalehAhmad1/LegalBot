that are due to take place there on 26th August 2023 and 27th August 2023. 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the

The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2), the Rhyl Air Show flying display 
director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM).

an immediate choice decision is made that no section 6 election is to be made in relation to M’s remediable service,
section 6(4) of PSPJOA 2022 does not apply in relation to M’s reformed scheme service (and, accordingly, section 2(1) of PSPJOA 2022 has effect in relation to M’s reformed scheme service for the purposes mentioned in section 2(3)(b) of that Act from the time the immediate choice decision is made).

(2) An immediate choice decision may not be made unless a remediable service statement has been provided to D in accordance with paragraph 4(2)(a), or, where sub-paragraph (3) applies, in accordance with paragraph 4(3).
(3) Where—
(a)
a remediable service statement has been provided to M in accordance with paragraph 4(2)(a), and
(b)
M dies before making an immediate choice decision under paragraph 8,
the section 6 election period is treated as though it had never begun in relation to M.

(a)
information in D’s possession, or
(b)
information which D can reasonably be expected to obtain.
Immediate choice decision: deemed election
10.  Where—
(a)
the end of the section 6 election period in relation to M has passed, and
(b)

7.—(1) A decision (an “immediate choice decision”) may be made in accordance with this Chapter—
(a)
to make an election (a “section 6 election”) by virtue of section 6 of PSPJOA 2022 in relation to M’s remediable service, or
(b)
that no section 6 election is to be made in relation to that service.
(2) An immediate choice decision may only be made by M.

(4) An immediate choice decision may only be made before the end of the section 6 election period.

(a)
immediately before 1st October 2023, M had remediable service in the reformed scheme (“the reformed scheme service”), and
(b)
an immediate choice decision is made that no section 6 election is to be made in relation to M’s remediable service,

(a)
to make an election (a “section 10 election”) by virtue of section 10 of PSPJOA 2022 in relation to M’s remediable service, or

(4) A deferred choice decision may only be made before the end of the section 10 election period.

(6) Where the deferred choice decision is that no section 10 election is to be made, the benefits payable to or in respect of M, so far as they are determined by reference to M’s remediable service, are legacy scheme benefits.
(7) The following provisions of PSPJOA 2022 have effect in relation to a decision that no section 10 election is to be made as they have effect in relation to a section 10 election—
(a)
section 10(5) (section 10 election has effect in respect of all remediable service in the employment or office);

at the end of the day 6 months after the day the remediable service statement mentioned in paragraph (a) was issued;
(ii)
subject to sub-paragraph (3), at the end of such other day as the Scheme manager considers reasonable in all the circumstances.
(2) The end of the period during which a deferred choice decision may be made must not be more than one year before the day on which it is reasonably expected that legacy scheme benefits would become payable to or in respect of M.
(3) A deferred choice decision made by M may be revoked—
(a)
at any time before the cancellation deadline, and
(b)
by M communicating to the Scheme manager notice of the revocation in a form and manner determined by the Scheme manager.

Schedule 3 to the AFPS 2005 applies.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25) (“PSPA 2013”) makes provision, and confers powers to make further provision (in the form of “Scheme regulations” as defined in section 1 of PSPA 2013), about the establishment of public service pension schemes. The Armed Forces Pensions Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2336) (“the 2015 Regulations”) are the scheme regulations establishing the successor pension scheme (“the reformed scheme”) to six pre-2015 legacy pension schemes for members of the armed forces with effect from 1st April 2015. The Armed Forces (Transitional Provisions) Pensions Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/568) amended the relevant legacy pension schemes and provided for transitional protection for certain cohorts of legacy scheme members. Transitional protection of this sort was subsequently found to unlawfully discriminate between legacy scheme members on the basis of age.
The Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7) (“PSPJOA 2022”), at Chapter 1, makes provision, and confers powers for scheme regulations under PSPA 2013 to make further provision, in relation to specified service (“remediable service” as defined in section 1 of PSPJOA 2022) of members who benefited from transitional protection, and of members who did not benefit from transitional protection only by reason of their age. Section 22 of PSPJOA 2022 makes provision for scheme regulations to make provision about injury and compensation benefits payable under existing injury and compensation schemes, to make provision for cases where a member is made redundant, for cases where a member’s remuneration is subject to a condition relating to pensionable service under a particular scheme and for cases where two schemes make provision in relation to the same period of remediable service. Section 27 of PSPJOA 2022 requires certain powers to make scheme regulations to be exercised in accordance with Treasury directions.
These Regulations are scheme regulations under PSPA 2013 and made in accordance with PSPJOA 2022, and relate to a member’s remediable service in an armed forces pension scheme. They are, to the extent required by section 27 of PSPJOA 2022, made in accordance with Treasury directions under that section (in the form of the Public Service Pensions (Exercise of Powers, Compensation and Information) Directions 2022). These Regulations have retrospective effect, which is authorised by section 3(3)(b) of PSPA 2013.
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision for members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975 (“AFPS 1975”).

This Part amends Schedule 1 rules relating to reckonable service, abatement of pension, and the calculation of an officer’s pension. Schedule 3 is amended by substituting a definition of a member’s transition date and omitting the unlawfully discriminatory rule. This Part also inserts a new Schedule into the instruments containing the rules of the AFPS 1975, making provision for members with remediable service under PSPJOA 2022.
Part 3 of these Regulations makes provision for members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2005 (“AFPS 2005”).

This Part also inserts a new Schedule into the AFPS 2005, making provision for members with remediable service under PSPJOA 2022.

Part 5 of these Regulations makes provision for members of the Reserve Forces Pension Scheme 2005 (“RFPS 2005”). This Part amends rules relating to reckonable service, nomination of death in service benefits and abatement of pension. Schedule 3 to the RFPS 2005 rules is amended by substituting a definition of a member’s transition date and omitting the unlawfully discriminatory rule. This Part also inserts a new Schedule into the RFPS 2005, making provision for members with remediable service under PSPJOA 2022.
Part 6 of these Regulations makes provision for members of the Full-Time Reserve Service Pension Scheme 1997 (“FTRS 1997”). This Part amends rules relating to reckonable service and abatement of pension. Schedule 2 to the FTRS 1997 rules is amended by substituting a definition of a member’s transition date and omitting the unlawfully discriminatory rule. This Part also inserts a new Schedule into the FTRS 1997, making provision for members with remediable service under PSPJOA 2022.
Part 7 of these Regulations makes provision for members of the Non Regular Permanent Staff Pension Scheme (“NRPS 2011”). This Part amends a rule relating to reckonable service in Schedule 1. Schedule 3 to the NRPS 2011 rules is amended by substituting a definition of a member’s transition date and omitting the unlawfully discriminatory rule. This Part also inserts a new Schedule into the NRPS 2011, making provision for members with remediable service under PSPJOA 2022.
Part 8 of these Regulations makes provision for members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2015 (“the reformed scheme”).

Costs Limits in Aarhus Convention Claims
Scope and interpretation
46.24.—(1) This section provides for the costs which are to be recoverable between the parties in Aarhus Convention claims.
(2) In this Section—
(a)
“Aarhus Convention claim” means a claim brought by one or more members of the public by judicial review or review under statute which challenges the legality of any decision, act or omission of a body exercising public functions, and which is within the scope of Article 9(1), 9(2) or 9(3) of the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters done at Aarhus, Denmark on 25 June 1998 (“the Aarhus Convention”);
(b)
references to a member or members of the public are to be construed in accordance with the Aarhus Convention.
(3) This Section does not apply to appeals other than appeals brought under section 289(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990(1) or section 65(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990(2), which are for the purposes of this Section to be treated as reviews under statute.
(Rule 52.19A makes provision in relation to costs of an appeal.)
(The Aarhus Convention is available on the UNECE website at https://www.unece.org/env/pp/welcome.html.)
Opting out, and other cases where rules 46.26 to 46.28 do not apply to a claimant
46.25.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), rules 46.26 to 46.28 apply where a claimant who is a member of the public has—
(a)
stated in the claim form that the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim; and
(b)
filed and served with the claim form a schedule of the claimant’s financial resources, which is verified by a statement of truth and provides details of—
(i)
the claimant’s significant assets, liabilities, income and expenditure; and
(ii)
in relation to any financial support which any person has provided or is likely to provide to the claimant, the aggregate amount which has been provided and which is likely to be provided.
(2) Subject to paragraph (3), rules 46.26 to 46.28 do not apply where the claimant has stated in the claim form that although the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim, the claimant does not wish those rules to apply.
(3) If there is more than one claimant, rules 46.26 to 46.28 do not apply in relation to the costs payable by or to any claimant who has not acted as set out in paragraph (1), or who has acted as set out in paragraph (2), or who is not a member of the public.
Limit on costs recoverable from a party in an Aarhus Convention claim
46.26.—(1) Subject to rules 46.25 and 46.28, a claimant or defendant in an Aarhus Convention claim may not be ordered to pay costs exceeding the amounts in paragraph (2) or (3) or as varied in accordance with rule 46.27.
(2) For a claimant the amount is—
(a)
£5,000 where the claimant is claiming only as an individual and not as, or on behalf of, a business or other legal person;
(b)
£10,000 in all other cases.
(3) For a defendant the amount is £35,000.
(4) In an Aarhus Convention claim with multiple claimants or multiple defendants, the amounts in paragraphs (2) and (3) (subject to any direction of the court under rule 46.27) apply in relation to each such claimant or defendant individually and may not be exceeded, irrespective of the number of receiving parties.
Varying the limit on costs recoverable from a party in an Aarhus Convention claim
46.27.—(1) The court may vary the amounts in rule 46.26 or may remove altogether the limits on the maximum costs liability of any party in an Aarhus Convention claim.
(2) The court may vary such an amount or remove such a limit only on an application made in accordance with paragraphs (5) to (7) (“an application to vary”) and if satisfied that—
(a)
to do so would not make the costs of the proceedings prohibitively expensive for the claimant; and
(b)
in the case of a variation which would reduce a claimant’s maximum costs liability or increase that of a defendant, without the variation the costs of the proceedings would be prohibitively expensive for the claimant.
(3) Proceedings are to be considered prohibitively expensive for the purpose of this rule if their likely costs (including any court fees which are payable by the claimant) either—
(a)
exceed the financial resources of the claimant; or
(b)
are objectively unreasonable having regard to—
(i)
the situation of the parties;
(ii)
whether the claimant has a reasonable prospect of success;
(iii)
the importance of what is at stake for the claimant;
(iv)
the importance of what is at stake for the environment;
(v)
the complexity of the relevant law and procedure; and
(vi)
whether the claim is frivolous.
(4) When the court considers the financial resources of the claimant for the purposes of this rule, it must have regard to any financial support which any person has provided or is likely to provide to the claimant.
(5) Subject to paragraph (6), an application to vary must—
(a)
if made by the claimant, be made in the claim form and provide the claimant’s reasons why, if the variation were not made, the costs of the proceedings would be prohibitively expensive for the claimant;
(b)
if made by the defendant, be made in the acknowledgment of service and provide the defendant’s reasons why, if the variation were made, the costs of the proceedings would not be prohibitively expensive for the claimant; and
(c)
be determined by the court at the earliest opportunity.
(6) An application to vary may be made at a later stage if there has been a significant change in circumstances (including evidence that the schedule of the claimant’s financial resources contained false or misleading information) which means that the proceedings would now—
(a)
be prohibitively expensive for the claimant if the variation were not made; or
(b)
not be prohibitively expensive for the claimant if the variation were made.
(7) An application under paragraph (6) must—
(a)
if made by the claimant—
(i)
be accompanied by a revised schedule of the claimant’s financial resources or confirmation that the claimant’s financial resources have not changed; and
(ii)
provide reasons why the proceedings would now be prohibitively expensive for the claimant if the variation were not made; and
(b)
if made by the defendant, provide reasons why the proceedings would now not be prohibitively expensive for the claimant if the variation were made.
(Rule 39.2(3)(c) makes provision for a hearing (or any part of it) to be in private if it involves confidential information (including information relating to personal financial matters) and publicity would damage that confidentiality.)
Challenging whether the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim
46.28.—(1) Where a claimant has complied with rule 46.25(1), and subject to rule 46.25(2) and (3), rule 46.26 applies unless—
(a)
the defendant has in the acknowledgment of service—
(i)
denied that the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim; and
(ii)
set out the defendant’s grounds for such denial; and
(b)
the court has determined that the claim is not an Aarhus Convention claim.
(2) Where the defendant denies that the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim, the court must determine that issue at the earliest opportunity.
(3) In any proceedings to determine whether the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim—
(a)
if the court holds that the claim is not an Aarhus Convention claim, it shall, except for good reason, make no order for costs in relation to those proceedings;
(b)
if the court holds that the claim is an Aarhus Convention claim, it shall, except for good reason, order the defendant to pay the claimant’s costs of those proceedings to be assessed on the standard basis, and that order may be enforced even if this would increase the costs payable by the defendant beyond the amount stated in rule 46.26(3) or any variation of that amount.”.

the fast track;
(c)
the intermediate track; and
(d)
the multi-track.
(Rule 26.9 sets out the normal scope of each track. Part 27 makes provision for the small claims track. Part 28 makes provision for the fast track and the intermediate track. Part 29 makes provision for the multi-track.)
Automatic transfer in the High Court
26.2.—(1) This rule applies to proceedings in the High Court where—

the claim is for a specified amount of money;
(b)
the claim was commenced in a court which is not the defendant’s home court;
(c)
the claim has not been transferred to another defendant’s home court; and
(d)
the defendant is an individual.
(2) This rule does not apply where the claim was commenced in a specialist list.
(3) Where this rule applies, the court shall transfer the proceedings to the defendant’s home court when a defence is filed, unless paragraph (4) applies.
(Rule 2.3 defines ‘defendant’s home court’.)
(4) Where the claimant notifies the court under rule 15.10 or rule 14.5 that they wish the proceedings to continue, the court shall transfer the proceedings to the defendant’s home court when it receives that notification from the claimant.
(Rule 15.10 deals with a claimant’s notice where the defence is that money claimed has been paid)
(Rule 14.5 sets out the procedure where the defendant admits part of a claim for a specified amount of money)
(5) Where—
(a)
the claim is against two or more defendants with different home courts; and
(b)
the defendant whose defence is filed first is an individual,
proceedings are to be transferred under this rule to the home court of that defendant.
(6) The time when a claim is automatically transferred under this rule may be varied by a practice direction in respect of claims issued by the Production Centre.
(Rule 7.10 makes provision for the Production Centre.)
Transfer of money claims within the County Court
26.3.—(1) This rule applies where the claim is for an amount of money in the County Court, specified or unspecified.
(2) If at any time a court officer considers that the claim should be referred to a judge for directions, the court officer may send the proceedings to the defendant’s home court or the preferred hearing centre or other County Court hearing centre as may be appropriate.
(3) Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), if the defendant is an individual and the claim is for a specified sum of money, at the relevant time the claim must be sent to the defendant’s home court (save that where there are two or more defendants, one or more of whom are individuals, the claim must be sent to the home court of the defendant who first files their defence).
(4) Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), in any other claim to which this rule applies, the court must, at the relevant time, send the claim to the preferred hearing centre.
(5) Subject to paragraph (6), if, on their directions questionnaire—
(a)
a defendant under paragraph (3) has specified a hearing centre other than the defendant’s home court; or
(b)
a claimant under paragraph (4) has specified a hearing centre other than the preferred hearing centre,

whichever occurs first.
Directions questionnaire
26.4.—(1) Subject to rule 26.8, if a defendant files a defence—
(a)
a court officer shall—
(i)
provisionally decide the track which appears to be most suitable for the claim; and

serve on each party a notice of proposed allocation; and
(b)
the notice of proposed allocation shall—

when all the defendants have filed a defence; or
(b)
when the period for the filing of the last defence has expired,
whichever is the sooner.
(Rule 15.4 specifies the period for filing a defence.)
(4) If proceedings are automatically transferred under rule 26.2 or rule 26.3 the court in which the proceedings have been commenced—
(a)
shall serve the notice of proposed allocation before the proceedings are transferred; and
(b)
shall not transfer the proceedings until all parties have complied with the notice or the time for doing so has expired.
(5) If rule 15.10 or rule 14.5 applies, the court shall not serve a notice under rule 26.3(1) until the claimant has filed a notice requiring the proceedings to continue.

if the notice relates to the fast track, intermediate track, or multi-track, at least 28 days,
after the date when it is deemed to be served on the party in question.
(7) The date for complying with a notice served under paragraph (1) may not be varied by agreement between the parties.
(8) The time when the court serves a directions questionnaire under this rule may be varied by a practice direction in respect of claims issued by the Production Centre.
(9) If a claim is a claim to which rule 26.3 applies and a party does not comply with the notice served under paragraph (1) by the date specified—
(a)
the court shall serve a further notice on that party, requiring them to comply within 7 days; and
(b)
if that party fails to comply with the notice served under sub-paragraph (a), the party’s statement of case shall be struck out without further order of the court.
(10) If a claim is a claim to which rule 26.2 applies and a party does not comply with the notice served under rule paragraph (1) by the date specified, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate, including—
(a)
an order for directions;
(b)
an order striking out the claim;
(c)
an order striking out the defence and entering judgment; or
(d)
listing the case for a case management conference.
(11) Where a case has been struck out under paragraph (9)(b) or an order has been made under paragraph (10), a party who was in default shall, unless the court thinks it unjust to do so, be ordered to pay the costs that the default caused to any other party.
(Rule 7.10 makes provision for the Production Centre.)
(Rules 6.14 and 6.26 specify when a document is deemed to be served.)
Stay to allow for settlement of the case
26.5.—(1) A party may, when filing the completed directions questionnaire, make a written request for the proceedings to be stayed while the parties try to settle the case by alternative dispute resolution or other means.
(2) If all parties request a stay the proceedings shall be stayed for one month and the court shall notify the parties accordingly.
(3) If the court otherwise considers that such a stay would be appropriate, the court may direct that the proceedings, either in whole or in part, be stayed for one month, or for such other period as it considers appropriate.
(4) The court may extend the stay until such date or for such specified period as it considers appropriate.
(5) Where the court stays the proceedings under this rule, the claimant must tell the court if a settlement is reached.
(6) If the claimant does not tell the court by the end of the period of the stay that a settlement has been reached, the court shall give such directions as to the management of the case as it considers appropriate.
Referral to the Mediation Service
26.6.—(1) This rule applies to claims started in the County Court which would normally be allocated to the small claims track pursuant to rule 26.9.
(2) This rule does not apply to—
(a)
road traffic accident, personal injury or housing disrepair claims; or
(b)
any claim in which any party to the proceedings does not agree to referral to the Mediation Service.
(3) In this rule, ‘the Mediation Service’ means the Small Claims Mediation Service operated by His Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service.
(4) Where all parties indicate on their directions questionnaire that they agree to mediation, the claim shall be referred to the Mediation Service.
(5) If a claim to which this rule applies is settled, the proceedings shall automatically be stayed with permission to apply for—
(a)
judgment for the unpaid balance of the outstanding sum of the settlement agreement; or
(b)
the claim to be restored for hearing of the full amount claimed,
unless the parties have agreed that the claim is to be discontinued or dismissed.
Allocation and assignment
26.7.—(1) Subject to rule 26.8, the court shall allocate the claim to a track and, where applicable, assign it to a complexity band—
(a)
when all parties have filed their directions questionnaires; or
(b)
when giving directions pursuant to rule 26.4(10),
unless it has stayed the proceedings under rule 26.5.
(2) If the court has stayed the proceedings under rule 26.5, it shall allocate the claim to a track and, where applicable, assign it to a complexity band at the end of the period of the stay.
(3) If—

a claim is referred to the Mediation Service pursuant to rule 26.6; and
(b)
the court has not been notified in writing that a settlement has been agreed,
the claim shall be allocated to a track and, where applicable, assigned to a complexity band in accordance with this rule no later than four weeks from the date on which the last directions questionnaire is filed.
(4) Before deciding the track to which to allocate or the complexity band to which to assign proceedings, or deciding whether to give directions for an allocation hearing or an assignment hearing to be fixed, the court may order a party to provide further information about his case.
(5) The court may hold an allocation hearing or an assignment hearing if it thinks it is necessary.
(6) If a party fails to file a directions questionnaire, the court may give any direction it considers appropriate.
(7) When, in a claim to which Section VI or Section VII of Part 45 applies, the court decides the track to which a claim should be allocated or the complexity band to which it should be assigned—
(a)
it shall also consider whether it is in the interests of justice to order that rule 45.5(4) should apply to that claim; and
(b)
when considering whether it is in the interests of justice to make such an order, it shall have regard to whether the claim of each claimant arises from the same or substantially the same facts and gives rise to the same or substantially the same issues.

the parties have followed the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents; and
(b)
proceedings have been started under Practice Direction 27B.

the amount claimed is more than £10,000; or
(ii)
the claim for personal injury damages is more than £5,000; or
(b)
rule 26.10 applies,
a court officer must refer the claim to a judge for allocation to a track and to give directions.

(a)
any claim for personal injuries where—
(i)
the value of the claim is not more than £10,000; and

(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) ‘damages for personal injuries’ means damages claimed as compensation for pain, suffering and loss of amenity and does not include any other damages which are claimed.
(3) ‘Road traffic accident’ means an accident resulting in a bodily injury to any person caused by, or arising out of, the use of a motor vehicle on a road or other public place in England and Wales unless the injury was caused wholly or in part by a breach by the defendant of one or more of the relevant statutory provisions as defined by section 53 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974(2).
(4) Subject to paragraph (1), the small claims track is the normal track for any claim which has a value of not more than £10,000.
(Rule 26.12(2) and (3) provides that the court must not allocate to the small claims track certain claims in respect of harassment or unlawful eviction.)
(5) Subject to paragraphs (6) and (10), the fast track is the normal track for any claim—
(a)
for which the small claims track is not the normal track; and
(b)
the claim—
(i)
is a claim for monetary relief, the value of which is not more than £25,000; or
(ii)
is or includes a claim for non-monetary relief and—
(aa)
if the claim includes a claim for monetary relief, the value of the claim for monetary relief is not more than £25,000;
(bb)
the claim meets the criteria in paragraph (6)(a) and (b); and
(cc)
the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice for it to be allocated to the fast track.
(6) The fast track is the normal track for the claims referred to in paragraph (5) only if the court considers that—
(a)
the trial is likely to last for no longer than one day; and
(b)
oral expert evidence at trial is likely to be limited to—
(i)
one expert per party in relation to any expert field; and
(ii)
expert evidence in two expert fields.
(7) Subject to paragraphs (8), (9) and (10), the intermediate track is the normal track where—
(a)
the claim is suitable for neither the small claims track nor the fast track;
(b)
the claim includes a claim for monetary relief, the value of which is not more than £100,000;
(c)
the court considers that—
(i)
if the case is managed proportionately, the trial will not last longer than three days;
(ii)
oral expert evidence at trial is likely to be limited to two experts per party;
(iii)
the claim may be justly and proportionately managed under the procedure set out in Section IV of Part 28; and
(iv)
there are no additional factors, which would make the claim inappropriate for the intermediate track; and
(d)
the claim is brought by one claimant against either one or two defendants, or is brought by two claimants against one defendant.
(8) Where the relief sought includes a claim for non-monetary relief, the claim shall not be allocated to the intermediate track unless the court also considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so.
(9) Subject to paragraph (10), the court may allocate a claim to the intermediate track where it considers it to be in the interests of justice to do so.
(10) A claim must be allocated to the multi-track where that claim is—

a mesothelioma claim or asbestos lung disease claim;
(b)
one which includes a claim for clinical negligence, unless—

(ii)
both breach of duty and causation have been admitted;
(c)
a claim for damages in relation to harm, abuse or neglect of or by children or vulnerable adults;
(d)
a claim is one the court could order to be tried by jury if satisfied that there is in issue a matter set out in section 66(3) of the County Courts Act 1984(3) or section 69(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981(4); or
(e)
a claim against the police which includes a claim for—
(i)
an intentional or reckless tort; or

(a)
a road accident claim arising from negligent police driving;
(b)
an employer’s liability claim;

(e)
unless rule 26.11 applies, on the date of the accident, the defendant’s vehicle was registered outside the United Kingdom.
Children and protected parties
26.11.—(1) The fast track is the normal track where a claim—
(a)
is for personal injuries arising from a road traffic accident which occurs on or after 31st May 2021;
(b)
is made by—
(i)
a child or a protected party; or
(ii)
a person who, on the date the claim was first presented via the Pre-Action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents, was a child; and
(c)
consists of, or includes, a claim for a whiplash injury.
(2) Where this rule applies, the claim must not be allocated to the small claims track.
(3) ‘Whiplash injury’ has the meaning ascribed to it by paragraph 1.2(38) of the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents.
Allocation - general
26.12.—(1) In considering whether to allocate a claim to the normal track for that claim under rules 26.9, 26.10 or 26.11, the court shall have regard to the matters mentioned in rule 26.13(1).
(2) The court must not allocate a claim to the small claims track, if it includes a claim by a tenant of residential premises against his landlord for a remedy in respect of harassment or unlawful eviction.
(3) In claims under the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, the court must not allocate a claim to the small claims track if it includes a claim by a contract-holder of a dwelling against their landlord for a remedy in respect of harassment or unlawful eviction.
Matters relevant to allocation to a track
26.13.—(1) When deciding the track for a claim, the matters to which the court shall have regard include—
(a)
the financial value, if any, of the claim;
(b)
the nature of the remedy sought;
(c)
the likely complexity of the facts, law or evidence;
(d)
the number of parties or likely parties;
(e)
the value of any counterclaim or additional claim and the complexity of any matters relating to it;
(f)
the amount of oral evidence which may be required;
(g)
the importance of the claim to persons who are not parties to the proceedings;
(h)
the views expressed by the parties; and
(i)
the circumstances of the parties.
(2) It is for the court to assess the financial value of a claim and in doing so it shall disregard—
(a)
any amount not in dispute;
(b)
any claim for interest;
(c)
costs;
(d)
any contributory negligence; and
(e)
where the claim is, or includes a claim for non-monetary relief, any amount prescribed by rule 45.45(1)(a)(ii) and rule 45.50(2)(b)(ii).
(3) Where—
(a)
two or more claimants have started a claim against the same defendant using the same claim form; and
(b)
each claimant has a claim against the defendant separate from the other claimants,
the court shall consider the claim of each claimant separately when it assesses financial value under paragraph (1).
Assignment within the fast track and the intermediate track
26.14.—(1) When a claim is allocated to the fast track or the intermediate track, the court must also assign the claim to a complexity band, unless it is one to which Section VIII of Part 45 applies.
(2) In both Table 1 and Table 2, below, the complexity bands numbered 1 to 4 provide an ascending scale of allowable costs commensurate with the complexity of the claim.
(3) The complexity band to which a claim is assigned shall determine the costs that are to be allowed under Table 12 or Table 14 in Practice Direction 45.
(4) Subject to paragraph (5), the parties may agree the complexity band to which a claim is assigned.
(5) The court may direct that a claim be assigned to a different complexity band than that agreed by the parties, but shall have regard to the factors set out in rule 26.13(1).
(6) A party must state on their directions questionnaire—
(a)
the agreed complexity band; or
(b)
where the parties disagree, the complexity band considered appropriate by that party,
together with any relevant information in support.
Assignment within the fast track
26.15.  Unless the claim is one for noise induced hearing loss (in respect of which Sections I and IV of Part 28 and Section VIII of Part 45 make provision), the complexity band to which a claim will normally be assigned in the fast track is set out in Table 1.
Table 1
Complexity band 1 Complexity band 2 Complexity band 3 Complexity band 4
(a) road traffic accident related, non-personal injury claims; and
(b) defended debt claims
(a) road traffic accident related, personal injury claims which are or should have been started under the RTA Protocol; and
(b) personal injury claims to which the Pre-action Protocol for Resolution of Package Travel Claims apply
(a) road traffic accident related, personal injury claims to which the RTA Protocol does not apply;

(b) complex possession and housing disrepair claims;
(c) property and building disputes;
(d) professional negligence claims; and
(e) any claim which would normally be allocated to the fast track, but is nonetheless complex
Assignment within the intermediate track
26.16.  The complexity band to which a claim will normally be assigned in the intermediate track is set out in Table 2.
Table 2
Complexity band 1 Complexity band 2 Complexity band 3 Complexity band 4
Any claim where—
(a) only one issue is in dispute; and
(b) the trial is not expected to last longer than one day, including—
(i) personal injury claims where liability or quantum is in dispute;
(ii) non-personal injury road traffic claims; and
(iii) defended debt claims
Any less complex claim where more than one issue is in dispute, including personal injury accident claims where liability and quantum are in dispute Any more complex claim where more than one issue is in dispute, but which is unsuitable for assignment to complexity band 2, including noise induced hearing loss and other employer’s liability disease claims Any claim which would normally be allocated to the intermediate track, but which is unsuitable for assignment to complexity bands 1 to 3, including any personal injury claim where there are serious issues of fact or law
26.17.  When it has allocated a claim to a track, the court shall serve notice of allocation and, where applicable, assignment on every party.

reassign a claim to a different complexity band.

(a)
a claim is allocated to the intermediate track; and
(b)
directions in respect of that claim have been given,
the court may only reallocate the claim where it decides that there are exceptional reasons to justify doing so.

(Part 27 sets out the procedure for claims allocated to the small claims track.)
(Part 29 sets out the procedure for claims allocated to the multi-track.)
General provisions
28.2.—(1) When it allocates a case to the fast track or intermediate track, the court shall give directions for the management of the case and set a timetable for the steps to be taken between the giving of the directions and the trial.

(a)
make an order in relation to disclosure; and
(b)
either—
(i)
fix the trial date; or
(ii)
fix a period, not exceeding 3 weeks, within which the trial is to take place.
(3) In claims within Section II and Section IV of this Part, other than in respect of claims which include a claim for personal injury, the court shall decide, having regard to the overriding objective and the need to limit disclosure to that which is necessary to deal with the case justly, which of the following orders to make in relation to disclosure—
(a)
an order dispensing with disclosure;
(b)
an order that a party disclose the documents on which it relies, and at the same time request any specific disclosure it requires from any other party;
(c)
an order that directs, where practicable, the disclosure to be given by each party on an issue-by-issue basis;
(d)
an order that each party disclose any documents which it is reasonable to suppose may contain information which enables that party to advance its own case or to damage that of any other party, or which leads to an enquiry which has either of those consequences;
(e)
an order that a party give standard disclosure;
(f)
any other order in relation to disclosure that the court considers appropriate.
(Rule 31.6 explains what is meant by standard disclosure.)
(4) Unless the court otherwise orders, disclosure under Section II and Section IV of this Part in respect of claims which include a claim for personal injury shall be standard disclosure.

(d)
the trial; or

(Rule 2.11 allows the parties to vary a date by written agreement except where the rules provide otherwise or the court orders otherwise.)
Pre-trial check list (listing questionnaire)
28.4.—(1) The court shall send the parties a pre-trial check list (listing questionnaire) for completion and return by the date specified in the notice of allocation unless it considers that the claim can proceed to trial without the need for a pre-trial check list.
(2) The date specified for filing a pre-trial check list shall not be more than 8 weeks before the trial date or the beginning of the trial period.
(3) If no party files the completed pre-trial check list by the date specified, the court shall order that unless a completed pre-trial check list is filed within 7 days from service of that order, the claim, defence and any counterclaim shall be struck out without further order of the court.
(4) If—
(a)
a party files a completed pre-trial check list but another party does not;
(b)
a party has failed to give all the information requested by the pre-trial check list; or
(c)
the court considers that a hearing is necessary to enable it to decide what directions to give in order to complete preparation of the case for trial,
the court may give such directions as it thinks appropriate.

SECTION I
General Provisions
Scope of this Part
45.1.—(1) This Part sets out the amounts to be allowed for costs in the categories of claim to which it applies.
(2) In the categories of claim to which this Part applies, the court has a discretion as to—
(a)
whether costs are payable by one party to another;
(b)
when they are to be paid; and
(c)
whether to make an order in the form contemplated by rule 44.2(6)(a).
(3) Where—
(a)
a claim is one to which Section IV, Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part applies; and
(b)
the parties agree or the court orders that a party is entitled to costs,
subject to the application of any rule in those Sections or this Section by which costs are to be allowed, disallowed, increased or reduced, the court may only award costs in an amount that is neither more nor less than the fixed costs allowed by the applicable Section and set out in the relevant table in Practice Direction 45.
(4) Section VI and Section VII of this Part do not apply to a claim or counterclaim which relates, in whole or in part, to a residential property or dwelling and which, in respect of that property, includes a claim or counterclaim for—
(a)
possession;
(b)
disrepair; or
(c)
unlawful eviction,
save where the claim or counterclaim in respect of the residential property or dwelling arises from a boundary dispute.
(5) Where a claim relates in part to a residential property or dwelling and that part of the claim is concluded or discontinued, paragraph (4) shall continue to apply to the remainder of the claim.
(6) Section VI, Section VII and Section VIII of this Part do not apply where a party is a protected party.
(7) In this Part—
(a)
‘an order for costs’, includes orders for costs deemed to have been made (either against the claimant or in favour of the claimant) as set out in rule 44.9;
(b)
‘the relevant Protocol’ means—
(i)
the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents (‘the RTA Protocol’); or
(ii)
the Pre-action Protocol for Low Value Personal Injury Claims (Employers’ Liability and Public Liability) Claims (‘the EL/PL Protocol’); and
(c)
a reference to a table by number alone is a reference to the corresponding table in Practice Direction 45.
(8) A reference in any rule to an amount in a table in Practice Direction 45 is a reference to the amount applicable to a claim on the date that proceedings are issued, regardless of any subsequent amendment.
VAT
45.2.  Where appropriate, VAT may be recovered in addition to the amount of fixed costs in Section IV, Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part and any reference to fixed costs in those Sections is a reference to those costs net of any such VAT.
Additional costs for work in specified areas (‘London weighting’)
45.3.—(1) Where fixed costs are payable under Section IV, Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part and the receiving party—
(a)
lives, works or carries on business in any area set out in Section II of Practice Direction 45; and
(b)
instructs a legal representative with conduct of the litigation who practises in any of those areas,
the fixed costs shall include, in addition to the costs allowable in the relevant Section, an amount equal to 12.5% of those fixed costs (‘London weighting’).
(2) In this rule ‘fixed costs’ excludes any disbursements.
Litigants in person
45.4.—(1) This rule applies to any claim where—
(a)
costs are payable under Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part; and
(b)
the party in whose favour the costs order is made is at any stage a litigant in person.
(2) Where this rule applies—
(a)
rule 46.5 shall apply, save that—
(i)
where a party is a litigant in person throughout the entire claim, the costs allowed under this rule shall not exceed, except in the case of a disbursement, two-thirds of the fixed recoverable costs which would have been allowed under Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII if the litigant in person had been represented by a legal representative;
(ii)
for any stage in Table 12, Table 14 or Table 15 during which the party is for any period a litigant in person, the costs allowed for that stage shall not exceed two thirds of the costs so specified; and
(iii)
for any stage in Table 12, Table 14 or Table 15 during which a party is represented by a legal representative for the entire stage, the fixed recoverable costs shall apply as set out in sub-paragraph (b), provided that the total amount of costs to be allowed shall not exceed the costs which would have been allowed if the litigant in person had been represented by a legal representative for the entire claim;
(b)
where sub-paragraph (a)(iii) applies, the fixed recoverable costs shall be as follows—
(i)
where the stage provides only for a fixed sum, the fixed sum;
(ii)
in any other stage the difference between the fixed recoverable costs for that stage and the fixed recoverable costs for the last stage before that when the party was a litigant in person.
Entitlement to costs – more than one claimant
45.5.—(1)  Unless paragraph (2) or paragraph (4) applies, where—
(a)
fixed costs are payable under Section VI or Section VII of this Part; and
(b)
orders for costs are made in favour of two or more claimants,
each claimant is entitled to the costs of their own claim in accordance with the applicable rules in this Part.
(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply where the claim is for a remedy to which the claimants are jointly entitled, and they are joined to the proceedings to comply with rule 19.3.
(3) Paragraph (4) applies where fixed costs are payable under Section VI or Section VII and—
(a)
a legal representative with conduct of the litigation acts for more than one claimant in the proceedings;
(b)
each of those claimants has a separate claim against the defendant;
(c)
an order for costs is made in favour of two or more of those claimants; and
(d)
the court has ordered that paragraph (4) shall apply.
(4) Where this paragraph applies—
(a)
the claimants in whose favour an order for costs is made shall only be entitled to one set of fixed costs;
(b)
the amount of the fixed costs to which those claimants are entitled is the sum of the allowable costs and the further amounts calculated in accordance with paragraph (5) and, where applicable, paragraph (7); and
(c)
those claimants are jointly entitled to any costs so ordered.
(5) A further amount equal to 25% of the allowable costs is to be added for each additional claimant in whose favour the order for costs is made.
(6) In paragraph (4), ‘the allowable costs’—
(a)
means—
(i)
the applicable costs payable to the claimant in respect of whom the damages of highest value are agreed or awarded; or
(ii)
where paragraph (i) would apply to two or more claimants, the applicable costs payable to whichever one of those claimants their legal representative chooses;
(b)
does not include any additional amounts under rule 36.24; but
(c)
may include the relevant trial advocacy fees if applicable; and
(d)
excludes any disbursements.
(7) In addition to the allowable costs under paragraph (4), those claimants who meet the criteria are entitled to London weighting.
(8) Where one or more of the claimants referred to in paragraph (4) is entitled to additional costs under rule 36.24(5) or increased costs under rule 45.13(2), the percentage increases for which those rules provide must be calculated by applying the relevant percentage to such proportion of the amount referred to in paragraph (4)(b) as reflects the proportion which each claimant so entitled bears to the total number of claimants to which paragraph (4) applies.
Defendants’ costs
45.6.—(1) Where, in any case to which Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part applies, the court makes an order for costs in favour of the defendant, the allowable costs are—
(a)
the fixed costs set out in Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII;
(b)
the applicable disbursements set out in Section IX of this Part.
(2) For the purpose of assessing the costs payable to a defendant by reference to the fixed costs in Table 12 and Table 14—
(a)
“value of the claim for damages” and “damages” shall be treated as references to the value of the claim, as defined in paragraph (3); and
(b)
if the claim is discontinued, a reference in Table 12 or Table 14 to the stage at which a case is settled shall be treated as a reference to the stage at which the case is discontinued.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), ‘the value of the claim’ is—
(a)
the amount specified in the claim form, without taking into account any deduction for contributory negligence, but excluding—
(i)
any amount not in dispute;
(ii)
interest; or
(iii)
costs;
(b)
if no amount is specified in the claim form, the maximum amount which the claimant reasonably expected to recover according to the statement of value included in the claim form under rule 16.3;
(c)
if the claim form states that the claimant cannot reasonably say how much is likely to be recovered—
(i)
£25,000 in a claim to which Section VI applies; or
(ii)
£100,000 in a claim to which Section VII applies;
(d)
if the claim has no monetary value—
(i)
the applicable amount in rule 45.45(1)(a)(ii) in a claim to which Section VI applies; or
(ii)
the applicable amount in rule 45.50(2)(b)(ii) in a claim to which Section VII applies; or
(e)
if a claim includes both a claim for monetary relief and a claim which has no monetary value, the applicable amount in sub-paragraph (d) taken together with the applicable monetary value in sub-paragraph (a), (b) or (c).
Counterclaims
45.7.—(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), if in any case to which Section VI or Section VII of this Part applies—
(a)
the defendant brings a counterclaim; and
(b)
the court makes an order for costs,
rules 45.5, 45.6, 45.9, 45.10, 45.11, 45.12, 45.13, 45.43, 45.45, 45.46, 45.49 and 49.50 shall apply as if the counterclaim were a claim.
(2) No costs are allowable under this rule where the only remedy sought by the counterclaimant is also a defence to the claim.
(3) Where in a claim to which the RTA Protocol applies, there is a counterclaim which does not include a claim for personal injuries, any order for costs shall be for a sum equivalent to one half of the applicable Type A and Type B costs in Table 10.
Pre-action and interim applications
45.8.  Where, in any claim to which Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part applies, the court makes an order for the costs of a pre-action or interim application, the costs which a party may be allowed are those set out in Table 1, together with any appropriate court fee.
Claims for an amount of costs exceeding fixed recoverable costs
45.9.—(1) The court may consider a claim for an amount of costs (excluding disbursements) which is greater than the fixed recoverable costs referred to in Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part where there are exceptional circumstances making it appropriate to do so.
(2) If the criteria in paragraph (1) are met, the court may—
(a)
summarily assess the costs; or
(b)
make an order for the costs to be subject to detailed assessment.
Claims for an amount of costs exceeding fixed recoverable costs – vulnerability
45.10.—(1) The court may consider a claim for an amount of costs (excluding disbursements) which is greater than the fixed recoverable costs referred to in Section VI, Section VII or Section VIII of this Part where—
(a)
a party or witness for the party is vulnerable;
(b)
that vulnerability has required additional work to be undertaken; and
(c)
by reason of that additional work alone, the claim is for an amount that is at least 20% greater than the amount of fixed recoverable costs.
(Rule 1.6 and Practice Direction 1A make provision for how the court is to give effect to the overriding objective in relation to vulnerable parties or witnesses).
(2) If the criteria in paragraph (1) are met, the court may—
(a)
summarily assess the costs; or
(b)
make an order for the costs to be subject to detailed assessment.
Failure to achieve costs greater than fixed recoverable costs
45.11.—(1) This rule applies where—
(a)
costs are assessed in accordance with rule 45.9(2) or 45.10(2); and
(b)
the court assesses the costs (excluding any VAT) as being an amount which is in a sum less than 20% greater than the amount of the fixed recoverable costs.
(2) The court shall make an order for the party who made the claim to be paid the lesser of—
(a)
the fixed recoverable costs; and
(b)
the assessed costs.
Costs of the costs-only proceedings or the detailed assessment
45.12.—(1) If the criteria in rule 45.9(1) or rule 45.10(1) are not met, the court may make an order for the fixed recoverable costs and any permitted disbursements only.
(2) Where—
(a)
the court makes an order for costs in accordance with paragraph (1); or
(b)
rule 45.11 applies,
the court may decide—
(i)
to make no order as to the costs of the costs only proceedings or detailed assessment; or
(ii)
to make an order for some or all of such costs to be paid by the party making the claim.

2005 c. 11.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of these Rules)
These Rules amend the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (‘the rules’) to extend the application of fixed recoverable costs (‘FRC’) to most civil proceedings allocated to the fast track and to the newly created intermediate track, which is also established by these Rules.
In particular, these Rules—
(a)
substitute Part 26 (case management – preliminary stage) with a revised Part, which—
(i)
provides for the new intermediate track, including its scope and the matters the court shall have regard to when deciding whether to allocate a claim to that track;
(ii)
for claims allocated to either the fast track or the intermediate track, also provides for assignment to one of four complexity bands, which will determine the amount of fixed costs allowable in respect of a claim under Part 45, and the matters the court shall have regard to when deciding the complexity band to which a claim should be assigned;
(iii)
specifies those claims which must be allocated to the multi-track, so will not be subject to fixed costs; and
(iv)
otherwise preserves the previous rules in Part 26, except for renumbering and minor consequential amendments;
(b)
substitute Part 28 (the fast track and intermediate track) with a revised Part, which makes general provision about the management of cases allocated to the fast and intermediate tracks, including provision regarding noise induced hearing loss (‘NIHL’) claims allocated to the fast track;
(c)
amend Part 36 (offers to settle), in respect of which the current provisions for offers to settle in low value personal injury claims, which are already subject to FRC, have been amended in consequence of the extension of FRC to other claims;
(d)
substitute Part 45 (fixed costs) with a revised Part, which—
(i)
specifies the applicable fixed costs and disbursements to be allowed in most claims allocated to either the fast track or the intermediate track and those NIHL claims allocated to the fast track;
(ii)
specifies those claims allocated to the fast track or the intermediate track to which FRC shall not apply; and
(iii)
subject to what follows, and except for renumbering and minor amendments, otherwise preserves the previous rules in Part 45 in so far they apply to—
(aa)
the fixed costs applicable to commencement, entry of judgment and enforcement;
(bb)
the fixed costs applicable a claim conducted by an HMRC Officer in the County Court for the recovery of a debt;
(cc)
the fixed costs applicable to claims started, or which should have been started, under the Pre-Action Protocols for Low Value Personal Injury Claims in Road Traffic Accidents and Low Value Personal Injury (Employers’ Liability and Public Liability) Claims; and
(dd)
the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents.
Both the new tables of fixed costs and those previously included in Part 45 will, going forward, be set out in Practice Diretion 45, to which the rules in Part 45 refer as appropriate.
Further, these Rules make consequential amendments to Parts 2, 3, 16, 21, 27, 29, 39, 44, 46, 52, 54, 55, 63 and 65 of the rules. Additionally, Part 46 now includes in section IX, as inserted by these Rules, those rules concerning costs limits in Aarhus Convention claims previously included in Section VII of Part 45.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Rules. An impact assessment prepared by the Ministry of Justice for its 2019 consultation on the extension of fixed recoverable costs, which was revised in 2021 on publication of its consultation response and to which these Rules give effect, is available from the Ministry of Justice at 102 Petty France, London.

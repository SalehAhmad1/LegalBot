(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument amends the Asylum Support Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/704) in the following ways. First, it increases the weekly cash payment made by the Secretary of State in respect of essential living needs of persons to whom the Secretary of State has decided to provide asylum support from £40.85 to £49.18. Secondly, it increases the additional weekly support for pregnant women and young children from £3.00 to £5.25 and for babies under 1 year old from £5.00 to £9.50. Thirdly, it extends the eligibility for additional weekly payments for young children to children aged 3 years old.
These regulations also revoke the Asylum Support (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/78), which set out the previous cash amounts payable.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

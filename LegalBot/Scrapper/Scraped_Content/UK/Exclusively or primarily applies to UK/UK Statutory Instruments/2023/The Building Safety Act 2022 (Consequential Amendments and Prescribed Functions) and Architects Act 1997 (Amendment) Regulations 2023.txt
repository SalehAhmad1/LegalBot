(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 9(3) of the Building Safety Act 2022 (c. 30) abolishes the Building Regulations Advisory Committee for England. The Building Regulations Advisory Committee for Wales will remain. Regulations 2 and 3 of these Regulations consequentially remove references to the Building Regulations Advisory Committee for England.
Regulation 4 prescribes as functions of the regulator, the Health and Safety Executive (“HSE”), certain functions of HSE as statutory consultee under town and country planning legislation. These are added to the functions of the regulator under or by virtue of the Building Act 1984 (c. 55) or the Building Safety Act 2022 to include them in the meaning of “building function” in Part 2 of the Building Safety Act 2022.
Regulation 5 amends Schedule 1 to the Architects Act 1997 to omit paragraph 20. The amendment is a consequence of amendments made to paragraph 19 of that Schedule by the Architects (Fees, Electronic Communications and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2022, S.I. 2022/1388.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

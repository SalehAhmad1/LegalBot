7th November 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (c. 22).
Regulations 2, 3 and 4 update references to documents containing information on the classification of imported goods (“commodity codes”). The documents add, simplify and replace commodity codes, update and correct descriptions and remove commodity codes that are no longer used in the United Kingdom’s tariff documents. They also add missing commodity codes in the authorised use documents. Finally, the documents reduce the rate of duty on fourteen commodity codes relating to bike parts.
In particular:
Regulation 2 amends the Customs (Special Procedures and Outward Processing) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1249) to refer to a revised “Authorised Use: Eligible Goods and Authorised Uses” document;
Regulation 3 amends the Customs Tariff (Establishment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1430) to refer to a revised “Tariff of the United Kingdom” document;
Regulation 4 amends the Customs (Reliefs from a Liability to Import Duty and Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1431) to refer to a revised “Authorised Use: Eligible Goods and Rates” document.
Regulation 5 amends Part B of Schedule 1 to the Customs (Tariff Quotas) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1432) to impose a condition relating to the use of five poultry quotas and one sugar quota where the products originate from Brazil.
Regulation 6 amends the definition of “Suspensions of Import Duty Rates Document” in the Customs Tariff (Suspension of Import Duty Rates) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1435) to refer to a revised version of this document. The document has been revised to correct minor errors.
Regulation 7 amends Schedule 1 to the Customs Tariff (Preferential Trade Arrangements) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1457) to give effect to updated versions of the preferential tariff reference documents and origin reference documents applicable in respect of preferential trade arrangements with various countries or territories. The preferential tariff reference documents update commodity codes to take account of “end of year” changes, update quota rates and volumes in accordance with the terms of the arrangements, and correct errors. The origin reference document for the Republic of Korea gives effect to amendments made to the rules of origin in the preferential trade arrangement with that country. The reference documents for Turkey correct an error relating to aluminium origin quotas.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared for this instrument as it contains no substantive changes to tax policy.

25th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the entry in the Designation of Schools Having a Religious Character (Independent Schools) (England) (No. 2) Order 2013 (S.I. 2013/2867) that relates to King’s School to reflect the changes to the school’s postcode and designation of religious character.
This Order revokes the instruments listed in article 4 to the extent set out in that article. The revocations relate to schools that have closed or that could not continue to be designated as a school with a religious character if they were to join a particular academy trust.
Designation as a school with a religious character permits the school to take account of certain religious or denominational considerations, such as when making specified employment decisions relating to teaching staff under sections 58 to 60 and 124AA of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

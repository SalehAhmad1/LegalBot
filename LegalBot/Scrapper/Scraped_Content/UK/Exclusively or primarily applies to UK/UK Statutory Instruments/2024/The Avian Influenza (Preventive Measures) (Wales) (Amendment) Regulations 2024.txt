15 July 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Avian Influenza (Preventive Measures) (Wales) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/2803 (W. 242)) (“the 2006 Regulations”).
Regulation 7 of the 2006 Regulations requires the keeper of 50 or more poultry on any one premises to notify the Welsh Ministers of specified information relating to those poultry and to inform the Welsh Ministers of specified changes to that information.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations replaces regulation 7 of the 2006 Regulations so that keepers of poultry and other captive birds (regardless of numbers) are required to notify the Welsh Ministers of specified information and for such information to be reviewed and updated on an annual basis. Additional information must also be provided as part of the notification procedure by keepers of 50 or more poultry or other captive birds.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations introduces a new regulation 7A into the 2006 Regulations. The obligation to notify is subject to an exception for keepers of other captive birds belonging to the order Psittaciformes (such as budgerigars or parrots) or Passeriformes (such as canaries or finches), housed fully within a dwelling or bird house with no direct access to open air.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

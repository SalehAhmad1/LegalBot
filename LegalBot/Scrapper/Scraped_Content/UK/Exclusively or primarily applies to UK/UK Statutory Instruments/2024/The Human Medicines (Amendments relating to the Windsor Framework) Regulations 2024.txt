(2) The applicant may, by way of derogation from paragraph 10 of Schedule 8, omit from the application the results of pre-clinical tests and of clinical trials relating to a reference medicinal product which is or has been authorised for not less than eight years, but must provide the results of appropriate pre-clinical tests or clinical trials relating to the differences referred to in paragraph (1).

(5) Unless replaced by guidelines published under paragraph (4), the guidelines published by the EMA under Article 10(4) of the 2001 Directive continue to apply as they applied immediately before IP completion day (subject to any amendments or variations published under that paragraph).
(6) If the licensing authority grants a UKMA(UK), in relation to the similar biological medicinal product in accordance with paragraph (2), it is a term of the authorisation that the product must not be sold or supplied, or offered for sale or supply, in the United Kingdom before the expiry of ten years beginning with the date on which the UK marketing authorisation for the reference medicinal product was granted.
(7) If during the first eight of the ten years referred to in paragraph (6), the marketing authorisation holder for the reference medicinal product requested and obtained a UKMA(UK) for one or more new therapeutic indications, and, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorisation, the licensing authority considers that new indications bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies, the period of ten years is extended to eleven years.
(8) Where an application is made for the grant or variation of a UKMA(UK) in relation to a new indication for a well-established substance, and significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication, the applicant for a UKMA(UK) under paragraph (1) may not refer in its application to those studies for the period of one year beginning with the date on which the licensing authority grants or varies a UKMA(UK) in relation to the new indication.”.

(4) Subject to sub-paragraphs (6), (13) and (14), a UKMA(GB) granted in accordance with regulation 53A or Article 10(4) and (6) of the 2001 Directive and in force immediately before 1st January 2025 for a biological medicinal product has effect on and after that date as a UKMA(UK)(Category 1) provided that there is or has been an EU marketing authorisation in force for the reference medicinal product.
(5) Subject to sub-paragraphs (6), (13) and (14), any other UKMA(GB) in force immediately before 1st January 2025 has effect on and after that date as a UKMA(UK)(Category 2).
(6) If the holder of a UKMA(GB) to which any of sub-paragraphs (1) to (5) applies notifies the licensing authority in writing before 1st January 2025 that it does not wish to be a holder of a UKMA(UK), the licensing authority must revoke the UKMA(GB) with effect from 1st January 2025.
(7) A UKMA(UK) which has effect by virtue of any of sub-paragraphs (1) to (5) is treated as if it had been granted by the licensing authority on the same terms as those on which the UKMA(GB) was granted, including any conditions or restrictions subject to which, and retaining any benefits with which, the UKMA(GB) was granted and which remain in force immediately before 1st January 2025.
(8) A UKMA(UK) in force immediately before 1st January 2025 for a generic medicinal product has effect on and after that date as a UKMA(UK)(Category 1) provided that there is or has been an EU marketing authorisation in force for the reference medicinal product.

(13) Subject to sub-paragraph (14), a UKMA(GB) in force immediately before 1st January 2025 ceases to have effect on 1st January 2025 if—

At 9.54 a.m. on 29th July 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The United Kingdom (“UK”) and the European Union (“EU”) agreed to the Windsor Framework in March 2023, including new arrangements relating to the supply of medicines from Great Britain (“GB”) to Northern Ireland (“NI”) (“the Agreement”) to come into effect in January 2025.
Regulation (EU) 2023/1182 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2023 on specific rules relating to medicinal products for human use intended to be placed on the market in Northern Ireland and amending Directive 2001/83/EC implements the Agreement in EU law. These Regulations amend the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (“the 2012 Regulations”) to implement the Agreement in domestic law and to make consequential changes.
Under the Agreement, medicinal products that would previously have fallen within the scope of the centralised procedure (products required under EU law to be authorised across the EU and NI on a centralised basis by the European Commission (on the recommendation of the European Medicines Agency)) must now be authorised by the UK regulator in accordance with the law of the UK. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has existing powers to authorise products falling outside the scope of the centralised procedure across the UK. These arrangements will therefore enable all types of medicines to be supplied with a single licence in a single pack for the whole of the UK.
These regulations amend the 2012 Regulations to apply these new arrangements, by providing for two categories of UK-wide marketing authorisation (Categories 1 and 2). Whether a medicinal product is authorised under Category 1 or 2 will depend on whether the product in question would have fallen within the centralised procedure or not. This means that, where there previously would have needed to be an EU authorised pack for NI, and a UK authorised pack for GB, there need now only be one pack. The 2012 Regulations continue to provide for marketing authorisations with a territorial limit of Northern Ireland, and for marketing authorisations with a territorial limit of Great Britain, although it will no longer be possible to apply for that latter type of authorisation.
The Agreement also removes the requirement under EU law that medicines packaging include a bar code encoding data that is uploaded into an EU-wide database.
Regulation 7 of these Regulations amends regulation 8 of the 2012 Regulations to provide that a “UK marketing authorisation” comprises the following different types of authorisation: UKMA(UK)(Category 1), UKMA(Category 2), UKMA(GB) and UKMA(NI).
Regulation 25 of these Regulations amends regulation 49 of the 2012 Regulations to define the different types of authorisation: UKMA(UK)(Category 1) and UKMA(UK)(Category 2), which permit marketing of a medicinal product in all the territories of the UK; UKMA(GB) which does not permit marketing of a medicinal product in Northern Ireland; and UKMA(NI) which does not permit marketing of a medicinal product in Great Britain.
The remainder of the amendments fall into the following categories:
amendments to references in the 2012 Regulations to different types of authorisation to ensure that the correct type of authorisation is referred to, so as to implement the Agreement,
amendments to ensure that provisions relating to guidance are consistent throughout the 2012 Regulations,
provision relating to data and marketing exclusivity periods for medicinal products marketed in the different territories of the UK,
provision to disapply the product identification and anti-tampering device rules contained in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/161 supplementing Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council by laying down detailed rules for the safety features appearing on the packaging of medicinal products for human use and to provide for a new “UK only” labelling requirement for products that are placed on the market in Northern Ireland.
Specific provision is made in relation to advanced therapy medicinal products and medicinal products for paediatric use to reflect the Agreement relating to these.
Regulations 133 and 146 make transitional provision in relation to existing authorisations and applications.

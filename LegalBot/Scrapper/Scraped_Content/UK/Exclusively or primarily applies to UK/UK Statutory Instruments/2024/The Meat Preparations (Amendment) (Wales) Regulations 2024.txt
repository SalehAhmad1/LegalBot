The Welsh Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 11A(1) of Schedule 2 to the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Wales) Regulations 2011(1).
(1)
S.I. 2011/2379 (W. 252). Paragraph 11A was inserted into Schedule 2 by regulation 2(2) of the Official Controls (Animals, Feed and Food, Plant Health Fees etc.) (Wales) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1639) (W. 344) and enables the Welsh Ministers to amend, modify or revoke any assimilated direct minor legislation made under Article 8(4) of Council Directive 2002/99/EC laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (OJ No L 18, 23.1.2003, p. 11) (“the 2002 Directive”). S.I. 2021/1 (W. 1), which is amended by regulation 3 of this instrument, modifies Commission Decision 2000/572/EC laying down animal and public health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of minced meat and meat preparations from third countries (EUDN 2000/572). Commission Decision 2000/572/EC (OJ No L 240, 23.9.2000, p. 19) was adopted under Council Directive 94/65/EC laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations (OJ No L 368, 31.12.1994, p. 10) (“the 1994 Directive”), but is to be construed as being made under the 2002 Directive by virtue of provision in Directive 2004/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ No L 157, 30.4.2004, p. 33) (“the 2004 Directive”). The 2004 Directive, which repealed the 1994 Directive, provided in Article 4 that references to certain Directives, including the 1994 Directive, should be construed as being made, as the context demands, to the 2002 Directive; accordingly, that rule of construction has the effect that the power in paragraph 11A of Schedule 2 to S.I. 2011/2379 (W. 252) to modify retained direct minor EU legislation made under Article 8(4) of the 2002 Directive extends to the modification of Commission Decision 2000/572/EC.Title, application and coming into force

11 April 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Decision 2000/572/EC (“2000/572/EC”) which lays down animal and public health conditions and veterinary certification for the importation of meat preparations from third countries.
Regulation 2 amends 2000/572/EC to remove the import condition that meat preparations from third countries have been deep-frozen at the production plant or plants of origin.
Regulation 3 revokes, in consequence, other instruments or the provisions of other instruments which modified that import condition.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

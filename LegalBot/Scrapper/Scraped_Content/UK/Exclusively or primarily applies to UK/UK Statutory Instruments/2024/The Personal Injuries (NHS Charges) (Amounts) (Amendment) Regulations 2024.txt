(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Personal Injuries (NHS Charges) (Amounts) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/295) (“the principal Regulations”) which make provision about the charges payable under the scheme for the recovery of NHS charges in cases where an injured person who receives a compensation payment in respect of their injury has received NHS hospital treatment or ambulance services.
Regulation 2 amends the principal Regulations by substituting a table in Schedule 1. This table provides for increased charges in respect of injuries which occur on or after 1st April 2024. Where the injured person is provided with NHS ambulance services, the charge will be £249 (compared with £243, for injuries incurred between 2nd October 2023 and 31st March 2024). Where the injured person receives NHS treatment at a hospital, but is not admitted to hospital, the charge will be £825 (compared with £806 for injuries incurred between 2nd October 2023 and 31st March 2024). The daily charge for NHS in-patient treatment will be £1,014 (compared with £991 for injuries incurred between 2nd October 2023 and 31st March 2024). The maximum charge in respect of an injury will be £60,610 (compared with £59,248 for injuries incurred between 2nd October 2023 and 31st March 2024).
Regulation 3 revokes the Personal Injuries (NHS Charges) (Amounts) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/969).

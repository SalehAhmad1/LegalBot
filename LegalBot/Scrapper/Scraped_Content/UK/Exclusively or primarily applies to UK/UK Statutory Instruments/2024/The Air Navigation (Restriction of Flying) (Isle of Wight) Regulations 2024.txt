Hampshire due to the intended holding there of the Isle of Wight Festival from 19th June 2024 to 
24th June 2024 (inclusive). 
In view of the significant number of helicopters expected to operate from the temporary heliport at 
East Cowes, Isle of Wight, Hampshire as well as the large number of people expected to attend the 
festival, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be 
restricted in the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
These Regulations apply except insofar as flying is already prohibited by the Air Navigation 
(Restriction of Flying) (Prisons and Young Offender Institutions) (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1101). 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour

manager may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular

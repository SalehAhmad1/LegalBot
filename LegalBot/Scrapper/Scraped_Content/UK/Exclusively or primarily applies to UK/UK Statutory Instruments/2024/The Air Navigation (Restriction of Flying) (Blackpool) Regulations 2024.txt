EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Blackpool, Lancashire due to the 
intended holding there of the Blackpool Seafront Air Display on the 10th August 2024 and 11th 
August 2024. 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the 
Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in 
the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(a)(i), the Blackpool Airshow flying 
display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr Alan Frew, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 0330 1382734.

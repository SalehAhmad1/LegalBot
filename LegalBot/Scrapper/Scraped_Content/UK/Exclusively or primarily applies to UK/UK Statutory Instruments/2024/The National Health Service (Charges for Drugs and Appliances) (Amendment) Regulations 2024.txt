2nd April 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) Regulations 2015 (“the Charges Regulations”).
The Charges Regulations include the charges that are payable for the supply of NHS drugs and appliances in England.
Regulation 3 inserts a definition for “prescription only medicine” into the Charges Regulations.
Regulation 4 amends regulations 3 to 9 of the Charges Regulations to increase the single prescription charge applied for the supply of drugs, appliances and elastic hosiery from £9.65 to £9.90 (if the hosiery charge is for a pair, the charge is double that amount). This is an increase of 2.59%. There are also increases to the charges for fabric supports and wigs of 2.58% on average.
Regulations 5 and 6 amend regulations 8 and 9 of the Charges Regulations to remove signature requirements in some cases in which a charge is paid.
Regulation 7 amends regulation 15 of the Charges Regulations to introduce the ability to revoke exemption certificates issued in error or because of fraud.
Regulation 8 amends regulation 16 of the Charges Regulations to increase the cost of 3 and 12-month pre-payment certificates, and monthly instalments for 12-month pre-payment certificates, by approximately 2.58%. Regulation 8 also allows third parties to make applications for pre-payment certificates on a patient’s behalf, and removes reference to the requirement for pre-payment certificates to be returned.
Regulation 9 inserts a new regulation 16A to include a statutory information gateway in respect of pre-payment certificates, to support the claiming and provision of such certificates and the management of those processes.
Regulation 10 removes the requirement for pre-payment certificates to be returned with refund applications.
Regulation 11 amends regulation 17A of the Charges Regulations to increase the cost of the HRT only pre-payment certificate from £19.30 to £19.80, an increase of 2.59%.
Regulation 12 makes transitional provision in relation to fabric supports and wigs supplied pursuant to NHS prescriptions written before 1st May 2024.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen, and only a limited impact on the public sector, below the threshold for producing a full impact assessment.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Royal Air Force Waddington, 
Lincolnshire during flying displays that are scheduled to take place there on 13th July 2024. 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the 
Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in 
the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
These Regulations apply except insofar as flying is already prohibited by the Air Navigation 
(Restriction of Flying) (Scampton) (Restricted Zone EG R313) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1221, 
amended by S.I. 2022/1320, 2023/234, 852, 879), and the Air Navigation (Restriction of Flying) 
(Prisons and Young Offender Institutions) (England and Wales) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 
2023/1101). 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permissions mentioned in regulation 3(2)(b), the Lincolnshire Terminal Air 
Traffic Control Centre (TATCC) and Royal Air Force Waddington Air Traffic Control may be 
contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr David Ridley, Airspace Regulator, 
Safety and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 382471.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Ryde, Isle of Wight, Hampshire 
due to the intended holding there of a flying display associated with the Isle of Wight Armed 
Forces Day on 30th June 2024. 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the display and therefore the 
Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in 
the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(a), the Isle of Wight Armed Forces Day 
flying display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr Alan Frew, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 0330 1382734.

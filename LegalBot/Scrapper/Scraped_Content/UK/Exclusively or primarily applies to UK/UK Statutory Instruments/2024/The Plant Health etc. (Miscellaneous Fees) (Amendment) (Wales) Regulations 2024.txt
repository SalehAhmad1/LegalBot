8 May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Plant Health etc. (Fees) (Wales) Regulations 2018 and the Plant Health (Fees) (Forestry) (Wales) Regulations 2019.
Regulation 2(2) amends the fees for documentary checks relating to certain plants, plant products or other objects originating from an EU Member State, Liechtenstein or Switzerland. It also provides that no fee is payable for physical and identity checks relating to certain goods from EU Member States, Liechtenstein and Switzerland and provides exceptions to that rule.
Regulation 2(3) inserts a table of certain plants, plant products and other objects to which the fees amended by regulation 2(2) relate. The table updates and corrects the import inspection fees for Solanum lycopersicum from Morocco and the Canary Islands.
Regulation 3 amends the Plant Health (Fees) (Forestry) (Wales) Regulations 2019. Paragraph (2) corrects the type of inspection for which a fee is chargeable under those Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ and is published on www.gov.wales.

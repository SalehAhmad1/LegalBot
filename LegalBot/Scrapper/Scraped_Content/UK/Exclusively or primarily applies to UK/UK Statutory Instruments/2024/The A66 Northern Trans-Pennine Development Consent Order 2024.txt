The application was examined by a Panel of four members (“the Panel”) (appointed by the Secretary of State) in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010(3).

The Secretary of State is satisfied that replacement land has been or will be given in exchange for the special category land (as defined in article 34 (special category land) of this Order), and the replacement land (as defined in that article) has been or will be vested in the prospective seller and subject to the same rights, trusts and incidents as attach to the special category land, and that, accordingly, section 131(4) of the 2008 Act applies. In accordance with section 132(3) of the 2008 Act, the Secretary of State is satisfied, having considered the report and recommendation of the Panel, that the parcels of land labelled 0102-02-54, 0102-02-57, 0102-02-58, 0102-02-70 and 0102-02-73 on the special category land plans and described in the book of reference (both terms being as defined in article 2(1) of this Order) when burdened with a new right created under this Order, will be no less advantageous than they were before the making of this Order to the following person: (a) the persons in whom they are vested; (b) other persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other right; and (c) the public.

8.—(1) Works constructed or maintained under this Order in relation to a highway which consists of or includes a carriageway are to be treated for the purposes of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act as major highway works if—
(a)
they are of a description mentioned in any of paragraphs (a), (c) to (e), (g) and (h) of section 86(3) (highway authorities, highways and related matters) of that Act; or
(b)
they are works which, had they been executed by the highway authority, might have been carried out in exercise of the powers conferred by section 64(1) (dual carriageways and roundabouts) of the 1980 Act or section 184(2) (vehicle crossings over footways and verges) of that Act.
(2) In Part 3 of the 1991 Act, in relation to works which are major highway works by virtue of paragraph (1), references to the highway authority concerned are to be construed as references to the undertaker.
(3) The following provisions of the 1991 Act do not apply in relation to any works executed under the powers conferred by this Order—
section 56(3) (power to give directions as to timing of street works);
section 56A(4) (power to give directions as to placing of apparatus);
section 58(5) (restriction on works following substantial road works);
section 58A(6) (restriction on works following substantial street works);

section 73C(9) (materials, workmanship and standard of re-surfacing);
section 78A(10) (contributions to costs of re-surfacing by undertaker); and
Schedule 3A(11) (restriction on works following substantial street works).
(4) The provisions of the 1991 Act mentioned in paragraph (5) (which, together with other provisions of that Act, apply in relation to the execution of street works) and any regulations made, or code of practice issued or approved under, those provisions apply (with the necessary modifications) in relation to any prohibition, restriction, regulation, alteration or diversion of a street of a temporary nature by the undertaker under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary prohibition, restriction or regulation of use or alteration or diversion of streets) whether or not the prohibition, restriction, regulation, alteration or diversion constitutes street works within the meaning of that Act.
(5) The provisions of the 1991 Act(12) referred to in paragraph (4) are—
section 54(13) (advance notice of certain works), subject to paragraph (6);
section 55(14) (notice of starting date of works), subject to paragraph (6);
section 57(15) (notice of emergency works);
section 59(16) (general duty of street authority to co-ordinate works);
section 60 (general duty of undertakers to co-operate);
section 68 (facilities to be afforded to street authority);
section 69 (works likely to affect other apparatus in the street);
section 75(17) (inspection fees);
section 76 (liability for cost of temporary traffic regulation); and
section 77 (liability for cost of use of alternative route),
and all such other provisions as apply for the purposes of the provisions mentioned above.
(6) Sections 54 and 55 of the 1991 Act as applied by paragraph (4) have effect as if references in section 57 of that Act to emergency works were a reference to a prohibition, restriction, regulation, alteration or diversion (as the case may be) required in a case of emergency.
(7) Nothing in article 9 (construction and maintenance of new, altered or diverted streets and other structures)—
(a)
affects the operation of section 87 (prospectively maintainable highways) of the 1991 Act, and the undertaker is not by reason of any duty under that article to maintain a street or to be taken to be the street authority in relation to that street for the purposes of Part 3 of that Act; or
(b)
has effect in relation to street works to which the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act apply.

9.—(1) Subject to paragraphs (6), (7) and (8), any highway (other than a trunk road or special road) to be constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority in whose area the highway lies and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, the highway, including any culverts or other structures laid under it, must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(2) Subject to paragraphs (3), (6), (7) and (8), where a highway (other than a trunk road or special road) is altered or diverted under this Order, the altered or diverted part of the highway must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, that part of the highway, including any culverts or other structures laid under it, must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(3) Subject to paragraphs (6), (7) and (8), where a footpath, bridleway or byway open to all traffic is altered or diverted under this Order along a vehicular private means of access, the altered or diverted part of the highway must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway authority and unless otherwise agreed in writing, be maintained (including any culverts or other structures laid under that part of the highway) by and at the expense of the person or persons with the benefit of the vehicular private means of access.
(4) Where a street which is not, and is not intended to be, a public highway is constructed, altered or diverted under this Order, the street (or part of the street as the case may be) must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority, unless otherwise agreed in writing, be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from its completion and at the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the street authority.
(5) Subject to paragraphs (6), (7) and (8), where a highway is de-trunked under this Order—
(a)
section 265(1) (transfer of property and liabilities upon a highway becoming or ceasing to be a trunk road) of the 1980 Act applies in respect of that highway; and
(b)
any alterations to that highway undertaken under powers conferred by this Order prior to and in connection with that de-trunking must, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from the date of de-trunking.
(6) In the case of any bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a trunk road or special road) over a trunk road or special road, the highway surface must from its completion be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority and the structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker.
(7) In the case of any bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a trunk road or special road) over another highway which is not a trunk road or a special road, both the highway surface and structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from their completion.
(8) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a private right of way (whether or not it also carries a footpath or bridleway), the surface of the street and the structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker.
(9) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by the undertaker to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without affecting any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(10) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (9), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.
(1)
Section 265 was amended by section 146 of, and paragraph 45 of Schedule 3 to, the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (c. 27) and section 57 of, and paragraph 52 of Schedule 1 to, the Infrastructure Act 2015 (c. 7).Permanent stopping up of streets and private means of access
10.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this article, the undertaker may, in connection with the construction of the authorised development, stop up each of the streets and private means of access shown on the rights of way and access plans and specified in columns (1) and (2) of Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Schedule 2 (permanent stopping up of highways and private means of access and provision of new highways and private means of access) to the extent specified and described in column (3) of those Parts of that Schedule.
(2) No street or private means of access specified in columns (1) and (2) of Parts 1 and 3 of Schedule 2 (being a street or private means of access to be stopped up for which a substitute is to be provided) is to be wholly or partly stopped up under this article unless—
(a)
the new street or private means of access to be constructed and substituted for it, which is specified in column (4) of those Parts of that Schedule, has been completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and is open for use; or
(b)
a temporary alternative route for the passage of such traffic as could have used the street or private means of access to be stopped up is first provided and subsequently maintained by the undertaker, to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority, between the commencement and termination points for the stopping up of the street or private means of access until the completion and opening of the new street or private means of access in accordance with sub-paragraph (a).
(3) No street or private means of access specified in columns (1) and (2) of Parts 2 and 4 of Schedule 2 (being a street or private means of access to be stopped up for which no substitute is to be provided) is to be wholly or partly stopped up under this article unless the condition specified in paragraph (4) is satisfied in relation to all of the land which abuts on either side of the street or private means of access to be stopped up.
(4) The condition referred to in paragraph (3) is that—
(a)
the undertaker is in possession of the land; or
(b)
there is no right of access to the land from the street or private means of access concerned; or
(c)
there is a reasonably convenient access to the land otherwise than from the street or private means of access concerned; or
(d)
the owners and occupiers of the land have agreed to the stopping up.
(5) Where a street or private means of access has been stopped up under this article—
(a)
all rights of way over or along the street or private means of access so stopped up are extinguished; and
(b)
the undertaker may appropriate and use for the purposes of the authorised development so much of the site of the street or private means of access as is bounded on both sides by land owned by the undertaker.
(6) Any person who suffers loss by the suspension or extinguishment of any private right of way under this article is entitled to compensation to be determined, in case of dispute, as if it were a dispute under Part 1 (determination of questions of disputed compensation) of the 1961 Act.
(7) Following the opening for public use of a public right of way that has been constructed, permanently altered or permanently diverted under the powers conferred by this article the undertaker must supply the surveying authority with plans showing that public right of way as constructed, permanently altered or permanently diverted together with a statement of the modifications required to the definitive statement.
(8) The plans and statement of modifications to the definitive statement referred to in paragraph (7) are deemed to be an order modifying the definitive map and statement made under section 53(3)(a) (duty to keep definitive map and statement under continuous review) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981(1).
(9) This article is subject to article 32 (apparatus and rights of statutory undertakers in stopped up streets).
(10) In this article “surveying authority” has the meaning given to it by section 66(1)(2) (interpretation of Part III) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.
(1)
1981 c. 69. Section 53(3)(a) was amended by section 51 of, and paragraph 1(1) and (3) of Schedule 5 to, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (c. 37).
(2)
The definition of “surveying authority” was substitute by section 7 of, and paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 to, the Local Government Act 1985 (c. 51). There are other amendments to section 66(1) that are not relevant to this Order.Temporary prohibition, restriction or regulation of use or alteration or diversion of streets
11.—(1) The undertaker may, during and for the purposes of constructing the authorised development, temporarily prohibit, restrict or regulate the use of, or temporarily alter or divert any street and may for any reasonable time—
(a)
divert the traffic from the street; and
(b)
subject to paragraph (3), prevent all persons from passing along the street.
(2) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph (1), the undertaker may use any street temporarily prohibited, restricted, regulated, altered or diverted under the powers conferred by this article and within the Order limits as a temporary working site.
(3) The undertaker must provide reasonable access for pedestrians going to or from premises abutting a street affected by the temporary prohibition, restriction, regulation, alteration or diversion of a street under this article if there would otherwise be no such access.
(4) The undertaker must not temporarily prohibit, restrict or regulate the use of or alter or divert any street for which it is not the street authority without the consent of the street authority, which may attach reasonable conditions to any consent, but its consent must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) Any person who suffers loss by the suspension of any private right of way under this article is entitled to compensation to be determined, in case of dispute, as if it were a dispute under Part 1 (determination of questions of disputed compensation) of the 1961 Act.Access to works
12.  The undertaker may form and lay out means of access, or improve existing means of access, at such locations within the Order limits as the undertaker reasonably requires for the purposes of the authorised development.Discharge of water
13.—(1) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), the undertaker may use any watercourse, public sewer or drain for the drainage of water in connection with the construction or maintenance of the authorised development and for that purpose may lay down, take up and alter pipes and may, on any land within the Order limits, make openings into, and connections with, the watercourse, public sewer or drain.
(2) Any dispute arising from the making of connections to or the use of a public sewer or drain by the undertaker under paragraph (1) is to be determined as if it were a dispute under section 106 (right to communicate with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991(1).
(3) The undertaker must not discharge any water into any watercourse, public sewer or drain except with the consent of the person to whom it belongs; and such consent may be given subject to such terms and conditions as that person may reasonably impose.
(4) The undertaker must not make any opening into any public sewer or drain except—
(a)
in accordance with plans approved by the person to whom the sewer or drain belongs; and
(b)
where that person has been given the opportunity to supervise the making of the opening.
(5) The undertaker must take such steps as are reasonably practicable to secure that any water discharged into a watercourse or public sewer or drain under the powers conferred by this article is as free as may be practicable from gravel, soil or other solid substance, oil or matter in suspension.
(6) Nothing in this article overrides the requirement for an environmental permit under regulation 12 (requirement for environmental permit) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016(2).
(7) In this article—
(a)
“public sewer or drain” means a sewer or drain which belongs to Homes England, the Environment Agency, an internal drainage board, a joint planning board, a local authority, a sewerage undertaker or an urban development corporation; and
(b)
other expressions, excluding watercourse, used both in this article and in the Water Resources Act 1991(3), have the same meanings as in that Act.

14.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this article, the undertaker may at the undertaker’s own expense carry out such protective works to any building lying within the Order limits or which may be affected by the authorised development as the undertaker considers necessary or expedient.
(2) Protective works may be carried out—
(a)
at any time before or during the carrying out in the vicinity of the building of any part of the authorised development; or
(b)
after the completion of that part of the authorised development in the vicinity of the building at any time up to the end of the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which that part of the authorised development is first opened for use.
(3) Subject to paragraph (5), for the purpose of determining how the functions under this article are to be exercised the undertaker may enter and survey any building falling within paragraph (1) and any land within its curtilage.
(4) Subject to paragraphs (5) and (6), for the purpose of carrying out protective works to a building under this article the undertaker may—
(a)
enter the building and any land within its curtilage; and
(b)
where the works cannot be carried out reasonably conveniently without entering land which is adjacent to the building but outside its curtilage, enter the adjacent land (whether or not such adjacent land is inside or outside the Order limits) but not any building erected on it,
and if it reasonably requires, the undertaker may take possession, or exclusive possession, of the building and any land or part thereof for the purpose of carrying out the protective works.
(5) Before exercising—
(a)
a right under paragraph (1) to carry out protective works to a building;
(b)
a right under paragraph (3) to enter a building and land within its curtilage;
(c)
a right under paragraph (4)(a) to enter a building and land within its curtilage; or

a right under paragraph (4)(b) to enter land,
the undertaker must, except in the case of emergency, serve on the owners and occupiers of the building or land not less than 14 days’ notice of its intention to exercise that right and, in a case falling within sub-paragraph (a) or (c), specifying the protective works proposed to be carried out.
(6) Where a notice is served under paragraph (5)(a), (5)(c) or (5)(d), the owner or occupier of the building or land concerned may, by serving a counter-notice within the period of 10 days beginning with the day on which the notice was served, require the question of whether it is necessary or expedient to carry out the protective works or to enter the building or land to be referred to arbitration under article 51 (arbitration).
(7) The undertaker must compensate the owners and occupiers of any building or land in relation to which rights under this article have been exercised for any loss or damage arising to them by reason of the exercise of those rights.
(8) Where—
(a)

apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.

MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR THE CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A)(1) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 4 to the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine Development Consent Order 2024 (the “2024 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A (counter notice requiring purchase of land not in notice to treat) to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 4 to the 2024 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection 3(a) to have entered on that land where it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(2) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 25 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 19 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 22(1) (compulsory acquisition of rights and restrictive covenants)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate context, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(3) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restricted covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 19 (compulsory acquisition of land)), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A(4) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(5) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(6) (unauthorised entry) and 13(7) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(8) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 25(4) (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND NOT IN NOTICE TO TREAT
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 26 (application of the 1981 Act) of the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine Development Consent Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 27(3) (acquisition of subsoil, etc., only) of the A66 Northern Trans-Pennine Development Consent Order 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or restrictive covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or restrictive covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

On street apparatus
3.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus in closed streets
4.—(1) Regardless of the temporary closure, alteration or diversion of streets under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary prohibition, restriction or regulation of use or alteration or diversion of streets), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to carry out and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the temporary closure, alteration or diversion was in that street.
(2) Where any street is stopped up under article 10 (permanent stopping up of streets and private means of access), any utility undertaker whose apparatus is in the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to the utility undertaker legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the utility undertaker in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of the utility undertaker to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 7 or to carry out works under paragraph 9.

(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 51 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 51 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker, without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 51 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
9.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which the plan and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency, but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses and costs
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker all expenses reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 51 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 5 or 7(2), or by reason of any subsidence resulting from such development or works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any unscheduled interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by a utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless the utility undertaker fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and professional like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; or
(b)
any part of the authorised development carried out by a utility undertaker in the exercise of any functions conferred by this Order pursuant to a transfer or grant under article 44 (consent to transfer benefit of Order).
(4) The utility undertaker must at all times take reasonable steps to prevent and mitigate any such expenses, loss, damage, penalty or costs.
(5) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Cooperation
12.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or a utility undertaker requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 7(2) or a utility undertaker makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 9, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the utility undertaker’s undertaking and each utility undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
13.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

Apparatus of National Grid in closed streets
22.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 10 (permanent stopping up of streets and private means of access), if National Grid has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street National Grid has the same rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to National Grid, or procure the granting to National Grid of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to National Grid in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up of any such street but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or National Grid to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 25 or the power of the undertaker, subject to compliance with this sub-paragraph, to carry out works under paragraph 27.
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary closure or diversion of any highway under the powers of article 11 (temporary prohibition, restriction or regulation of use or alteration or diversion of streets), National Grid is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such closed highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the closure or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
23.  The undertaker must exercise the powers conferred by article 14 (protective works to buildings) so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of National Grid (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
Acquisition of land
24.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker may not acquire any interest in land or apparatus or override any easement or other interest of National Grid otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of National Grid or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Grid and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Grid reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid unless otherwise agreed by National Grid, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure and secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works.
(3) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid or other enactments relied upon by National Grid as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 27 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
25.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to National Grid to its reasonable satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 26(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of, or secured by, the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker.
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
26.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Grid facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Grid.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 33 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of electricity undertaker
27.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan of the works to be executed and seek from National Grid details of the underground extent of their electricity tower foundations.
(2) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within (i) 15 metres measured in any direction of any apparatus, or (ii) involve embankment works within 15 metres of any apparatus, the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus;
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes; and
(g)
an assessment of risks of rise of earth issues.
(3) In relation to any works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres of any part of the foundations of an electricity tower or between any two or more electricity towers, the plan to be submitted under sub-paragraph (1) must, in addition to the matters set out in sub-paragraph (2), include a method statement describing—
(a)
details of any cable trench design including route, dimensions, clearance to pylon foundations;
(b)
demonstration that pylon foundations will not be affected prior to, during and post construction;
(c)
details of load bearing capacities of trenches;
(d)
details of any cable installation methodology including access arrangements, jointing bays and backfill methodology;
(e)
a written management plan for high voltage hazard during construction and ongoing maintenance of any cable route;
(f)
written details of the operations and maintenance regime for any cable, including frequency and method of access;
(g)
assessment of earth rise potential if reasonably required by National Grid’s engineers; and
(h)
evidence that trench bearing capacity is to be designed to support overhead line construction traffic of up to 26 tonnes in weight.
(4) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (2) or (3) apply until National Grid has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(5) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (6) or (8); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraph (2) or (3) apply, National Grid may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage, for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works executed under sub-paragraph (2) or (3) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (6), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where under sub-paragraph (6) National Grid requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and National Grid must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 19 to 21 and 24 to 26 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 25(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(12) In sub-paragraph (11) “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to or to prevent the occurrence of circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works believes on reasonable grounds to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.
Expenses
28.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid within 30 days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim from National Grid all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid;
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 25(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 33 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
29.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—

indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of National Grid.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (2) unless National Grid fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any part of the authorised works carried out by National Grid in the exercise of any functions conferred by this Order pursuant to a grant or transfer under article 44 (consent to transfer benefit of Order).

Apparatus of National Grid in closed streets
38.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 10 (permanent stopping up of streets and private means of access), if National Grid has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street National Grid has the same rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to National Grid, or procure the granting to National Grid of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to National Grid in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up of any such street but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or National Grid to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 41 or the power of the undertaker, subject to compliance with this sub-paragraph, to carry out works under paragraph 43.
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary closure or diversion of any highway under the powers of article 11 (temporary prohibition, restriction or regulation of use or alteration or diversion of streets), National Grid is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such closed highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the closure or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
39.  The undertaker must exercise the powers conferred by article 14 (protective works to buildings) so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of National Grid (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
Acquisition of land
40.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker may not acquire any interest in land or apparatus or override any easement or other interest of National Grid otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of National Grid or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Grid and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Grid reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid unless otherwise agreed by National Grid, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure and secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works.
(3) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid or other enactments relied upon by National Grid as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 43 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
41.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to(5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to National Grid to its reasonable satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 42(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of, or secured by, the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph 25(2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker.
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
42.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Grid facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Grid.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 49 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of gas undertaker
43.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan and, if reasonably required by National Grid, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any specified works until National Grid has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (5) or (7); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) National Grid may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage, for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Specified works must only be executed in accordance with—
(a)
the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid; and
(b)
such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or (7) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where under sub-paragraph (6) National Grid requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker such protective works (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) must be carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and National Grid must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(8) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or (7) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 41 and 42 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 41(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) ) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised works—
(a)
the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme; and
(b)
National Grid retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 44.
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(12) In sub-paragraph (11) “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to or to prevent the occurrence of circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works believes on reasonable grounds to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.
Expenses
44.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid within 30 days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim from National Grid all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid;
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 41(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 49 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
45.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (1) and (2), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from National Grid the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of National Grid.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless National Grid fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any part of the authorised works carried out by National Grid in the exercise of any functions conferred by this Order pursuant to a grant or transfer under article 44 (consent to transfer benefit of Order).
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) National Grid must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.

Works not in accordance with this Schedule
55.—(1) If any part of a specified work or any protective work required by the Agency is constructed otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of this Part of this Schedule, the Agency may by notice in writing require the undertaker at the undertaker’s own expense to comply with the requirements of this Part of this Schedule or (if the undertaker so elects and the Agency in writing consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to remove, alter or pull down the work and, where removal is required, to restore the site to its former condition to such extent and within such limits as the Agency reasonably requires.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) and paragraph 60, if, within a reasonable period, being not less than 28 days beginning with the date when a notice under sub-paragraph (1) is served upon the undertaker, the undertaker has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the requirements of the notice and has not subsequently made reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the Agency may execute the works specified in the notice and any reasonable expenditure incurred by the Agency in so doing is recoverable from the undertaker.
(3) In the event of any dispute as to whether sub-paragraph (1) is properly applicable to any work in respect of which notice has been served under that sub-paragraph, or as to the reasonableness of any requirement of such a notice, the Agency must not, except in the case of an emergency, exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (2) until the dispute has been finally determined in accordance with paragraph 62.

Agency access
58.  If by reason of construction of the specified work the Agency’s access to flood defences or equipment maintained for flood defence purposes is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access that will allow the Agency to maintain the flood defence or use the equipment no less effectively than was possible before the obstruction within 24 hours or as soon as reasonably practicable of the undertaker becoming aware of such obstruction.
Free passage of fish
59.—(1) The undertaker must take all such measures as may be reasonably practicable to prevent any interruption of the free passage of fish in the fishery during the construction of any specified work.
(2) If by reason of—

in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signallers, watch-persons and other persons whom it shall be reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer, require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work or from the substitution or diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works or a protective work, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work.
73.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus; and

(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 67(1) for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 67(1)) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 67(1) has effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) Prior to the commencement of the operation of the authorised development the undertaker must test the use and operation of the authorised development in a manner that must first have been agreed with Network Rail and if, regardless of any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing of the authorised development causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(c)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus or such EMI; and
(d)
the undertaker must not allow the use or operation of the authorised development in a manner that has caused or will cause EMI until measures have been taken in accordance with this paragraph to prevent EMI occurring.
(8) Where Network Rail approves modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus pursuant to sub-paragraph (5) or (6)—
(a)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
(b)
any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus approved pursuant to those sub-paragraphs must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 68.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 77(1) applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses suffered by Network Rail through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Network Rail’s apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which sub-paragraph (6) applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 72(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph shall be deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
(11) In relation to any dispute arising under this paragraph the reference in article 51 (arbitration) to a single arbitrator to be agreed between the parties is to be read as a reference to an arbitrator being a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology.
74.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work or a protective work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work or the protective work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work or protective work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.
75.  The undertaker must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Network Rail unless it has first consulted Network Rail and it must comply with Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.
76.  Any additional expenses which Network Rail may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work or a protective work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the undertaker, be repaid by the undertaker to Network Rail.
77.—(1) The undertaker must pay to Network Rail all reasonable costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part of this Schedule which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)

(b)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged upon a specified work or a protective work;
(c)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst accessing to or egressing from the authorised development;

in respect of any damage caused to or additional maintenance required to, railway property or any such interference or obstruction or delay to the operation of the railway as a result of access to or egress from the authorised development by the undertaker or any person in its employ or of its contractors or others; or
(e)
in respect of costs incurred by Network Rail in complying with any railway operational procedures or obtaining any regulatory consents which procedures are required to be followed or consents obtained to facilitate the carrying out of the authorised development,
and the undertaker must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or a protective work or any such failure, act or omission; and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision shall not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Network Rail must give the undertaker reasonable written notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of such claim or demand is to be made without the prior written consent of the undertaker.
(3) The sums payable by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) will if relevant include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs.
(4) Subject to the terms of any agreement between Network Rail and a train operator regarding the timing or method of payment of the relevant costs in respect of that train operator, Network Rail must promptly pay to each train operator the amount of any sums which Network Rail receives under sub-paragraph (3) which relates to the relevant costs of that train operator.
(5) The obligation under sub-paragraph (3) to pay Network Rail the relevant costs is, in the event of default, enforceable directly by any train operator concerned to the extent that such sums would be payable to that operator pursuant to sub-paragraph (4).
(6) In this paragraph—
“the relevant costs” means the costs, direct losses and expenses (including loss of revenue) reasonably incurred by each train operator as a consequence of any specified work or protective work including but not limited to any restriction of the use of Network Rail’s railway network as a result of the construction, maintenance or failure of a specified work or a protective work or any such act or omission as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1); and
“train operator” means any person who is authorised to act as the operator of a train by a licence under section 8 of the Railways Act 1993.
78.  Network Rail must, on receipt of a request from the undertaker, from time to time provide the undertaker free of charge with written estimates of the costs, charges, expenses and other liabilities for which the undertaker is or will become liable under this Part of this Schedule (including the amount of the relevant costs mentioned in paragraph 77) and with such information as may reasonably enable the undertaker to assess the reasonableness of any such estimate or claim made or to be made pursuant to this Part of this Schedule (including any claim relating to those relevant costs).
79.  In the assessment of any sums payable to Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule there must not be taken into account any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken by or any agreement entered into by Network Rail if that action or agreement was not reasonably necessary and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or increasing the sums so payable.
80.  The undertaker and Network Rail may, subject in the case of Network Rail to compliance with the terms of its network licence, enter into, and carry into effect, agreements for the transfer to the undertaker of—
(a)
any railway property shown on the works and land plans and described in the book of reference;

PART 7
FOR THE PROTECTION OF DRAINAGE AUTHORITIES
84.  The provisions of this Part of this Schedule apply for the protection of the drainage authorities unless otherwise agreed between the undertaker and a drainage authority.
85.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“construction” includes execution, placing, altering, laying, replacing, relaying, connecting, building, installing, removal and excavation, and “construct” and “constructed” are to be construed accordingly;
“drainage authority” means the drainage board concerned within the meaning of section 23 (prohibition on obstructions etc. in watercourses) the Land Drainage Act 1991(14);
“drainage work” means any ordinary watercourse and includes any bank, wall, embankment or other structure, or any appliance, constructed or used for land drainage or flood defence in connection with an ordinary watercourse which is the responsibility of the drainage authority;
“ordinary watercourse” has the same meaning as given in section 72 (interpretation) of the Land Drainage Act 1991;
“plans” includes sections, drawings, specifications and method statements; and
“specified work” means any of the following works carried out in relation to or which may affect any ordinary watercourse—
(a)
erecting any mill dam, weir or other similar obstruction to the flow of the watercourse, or raising or otherwise altering any such obstruction;
(b)
construction or installation of a bridge or other structure;
(c)
installing a culvert in the watercourse; or
(d)
altering a watercourse or a culvert or other form of drainage infrastructure in a manner that would be likely to affect the flow of the watercourse.
86.—(1) Before beginning to construct any specified work, the undertaker must submit to the drainage authority plans of the work, and such further particulars as the drainage authority may within 14 days of the first submission of the plans reasonably require.
(2) Any such specified work must not be constructed except in accordance with such plans as may be approved in writing by the drainage authority, or determined under paragraph 92.
(3) The drainage authority must approve or refuse approval of the plans for a specified work within 28 days of receipt of the later of—
(a)
the plans under sub-paragraph (1); or
(b)
such further particulars as the drainage authority may reasonably require under sub-paragraph (1).
(4) Any approval of the drainage authority required under this paragraph—
(a)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
(b)
is to be deemed to have been given if it is neither given nor refused within the period specified in sub-paragraph (3); and
(c)
may be given subject to such reasonable requirements or conditions as the drainage authority may make for the protection of any ordinary watercourse or for the prevention of flooding.
87.  The requirements or conditions which the drainage authority may make under paragraph 86 include conditions requiring the undertaker at its own expense to construct such protective works (including any new works as well as alterations to existing works) as are reasonably necessary—
(a)
to safeguard any ordinary watercourse against damage, or
(b)
to secure that the efficiency of any ordinary watercourse for flood defence or land drainage purposes is not impaired and that the risk of flooding is not otherwise increased, by reason of the specified work in relation to the ordinary watercourse.
88.—(1) Any specified work in relation to an ordinary watercourse, and all protective works required by the drainage authority under paragraph 86, must be constructed to the reasonable satisfaction of the drainage authority and an officer of the drainage authority is entitled, on giving such notice as may be reasonable in the circumstances, to inspect and watch the construction of such works.
(2) The undertaker must give to the drainage authority not less than 14 days’ notice of its intention to commence construction of any specified work and the undertaker must give to the drainage authority notice of completion of a specified work not later than 7 days after the date on which it is brought into use.
(3) If any part of a specified work in, over or under any ordinary watercourse is constructed otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of this Part of this Schedule, the drainage authority may by notice require the undertaker at its own expense to comply with the requirements of this Part of this Schedule or (if the undertaker so elects and the drainage authority in writing consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) at the undertaker’s expense to remove, alter or pull down the work and, where removal is agreed, to restore the site to its former condition to such extent and within such limits as the drainage authority reasonably requires.
(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), if within a reasonable period, being not less than 28 days from the date when a notice under sub-paragraph (3) is served upon the undertaker, it has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the requirements of the notice and subsequently to make reasonably expeditious progress toward their implementation, the drainage authority may execute the works specified in the notice and any expenditure reasonably incurred by it in so doing is to be recoverable from the undertaker.
(5) In the event of any dispute as to whether sub-paragraph (3) is properly applicable to any work in respect of which notice has been served under that sub-paragraph, or as to the reasonableness of any requirement of such a notice, the drainage authority must not, except in an emergency, exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (4) until the dispute has been finally determined.
89.—(1) From the commencement of the construction of any specified work until the date falling 12 months from the date of completion of the specified work (“the maintenance period”), the undertaker must at its expense, maintain in good repair and condition and free from obstruction the drainage work which is situated within the limits of deviation for that specified work and within land held or occupied by the undertaker, whether the drainage work is constructed under this Order or is already in existence.
(2) If any such drainage work which the undertaker is liable to maintain is not maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the drainage authority, it may by notice require the undertaker to maintain the drainage work at the undertaker’s expense, or any part of it, to such extent as the drainage authority reasonably requires.
(3) If, within a reasonable period being not less than 28 days beginning with the date on which a notice in respect of any drainage work is served under sub-paragraph (2) on the undertaker, the undertaker has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the reasonable requirements of the notice and has not subsequently made reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the drainage authority may do what is necessary for such compliance and may recover any expenditure reasonably incurred by it in doing so from the undertaker.
(4) In the event of any dispute as to the reasonableness of any requirement of a notice served under sub-paragraph (2), the drainage authority must not, except in a case of emergency, exercise the powers of sub-paragraph (3) until the dispute has been finally determined.
(5) This paragraph does not apply to—
(a)
drainage works which are vested in the drainage authority, or which the drainage authority or another person is liable to maintain and is not prevented by this Order from so doing; and
(b)
any obstruction of a drainage work for the purpose of a work or operation authorised by this Order and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule provided that any obstruction is removed as soon as reasonably practicable.
90.  Subject to paragraph 89(5)(b), if by reason of the construction of any specified work or of the failure of any such work the efficiency of any ordinary watercourse for flood defence or land drainage purposes is impaired, or that watercourse is otherwise damaged, so as to require remedial action, such impairment or damage must be made good by the undertaker at its own expense to the reasonable satisfaction of the drainage authority and if the undertaker fails to do so, the drainage authority may make good the same and recover the expense reasonably incurred by it in so doing from the undertaker.
91.—(1) The undertaker must make reasonable compensation for costs, charges and expenses which it may reasonably incur or which it may sustain—
(a)
in the examination or approval of plans under this Part of this Schedule; and
(b)
in the inspection and supervision of the construction of a specified work in respect of an ordinary watercourse or any protective works required by the drainage authority under this Part of this Schedule.
(2) The maximum amount payable to the drainage authority under sub-paragraph (1)(a) or (1)(b) is to be the same as would have been payable to the drainage authority in accordance with the scale of charges for pre-application advice and land drainage consent applications published on the drainage authority’s website from time to time.
92.  Any dispute arising between the undertaker and the drainage authority under this Part of this Schedule is to be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 51 (arbitration) of the Order.

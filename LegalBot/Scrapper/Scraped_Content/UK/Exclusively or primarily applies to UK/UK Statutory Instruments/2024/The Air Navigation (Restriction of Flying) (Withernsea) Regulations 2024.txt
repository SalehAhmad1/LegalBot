EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Withernsea, East Yorkshire 
during flying displays for the general public that are due to take place there on 11th August 2024. 
A large number of aircraft and parachutists will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the 
displays and therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that 
flying should be restricted in the vicinity of the display for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(b), the Withernsea Blue Light Weekend 
Air Display flying display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr Alan Frew, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 382734.

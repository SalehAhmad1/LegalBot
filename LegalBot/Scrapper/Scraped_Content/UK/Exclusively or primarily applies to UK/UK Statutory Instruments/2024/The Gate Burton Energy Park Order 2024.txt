the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuant of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 10 (modification of compensation and compulsory purchase enactments for the creation of new rights and imposition of new restrictive covenants) to the Gate Burton Energy Park Order 2024;
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(7) of Schedule 10 (modification of compensation and compulsory purchase enactments for the creation of new rights and imposition of new restrictive covenants) to the Gate Burton Energy Park Order 2024) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land where it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act to the acquisition of land under article 18 (compulsory acquisition of land) and as modified by article 25 (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right under article 20 (compulsory acquisition of rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows—
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 of the 1965 Act (measure of compensation in case of severance) substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry)(2) of the 1965 Act is modified to secure that, as from the date on which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to compulsory acquisition under article 18 (compulsory acquisition of land)), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant (which is deemed for this purpose to have been created on the date of service of the notice); and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry)(3), 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date)(4), 12 (penalty for unauthorised entry)(5) and 13 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority)(6) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 (7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 25(4) (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965) is so modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (counter notice requiring purchase of land not in notice to treat) substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 22 (application of the 1981 Act) of the Gate Burton Energy Park Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 23(3) (acquisition of subsoil only) of the Gate Burton Energy Park 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter notice, or
(c)
refer the counter notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of three months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory; cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of six weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense cause by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

SCHEDULE 13
ARBITRATION RULES
Commencing an arbitration
1.  The arbitration is deemed to have commenced when a party (“the claimant”) serves a written notice of arbitration on the other party (“the respondent”).
Time periods
2.—(1) All time periods in these arbitration rules are measured in days and include weekends, but not bank or public holidays.
(2) Time periods are calculated from the day after the arbitrator is appointed which is either—
(a)
the date the arbitrator notifies the parties in writing of his/her acceptance of an appointment by agreement of the parties; or
(b)
the date the arbitrator is appointed by the Secretary of State.
Timetable
3.—(1) The timetable for the arbitration is that which is set out in sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) below unless amended in accordance with paragraph 5(3).
(2) Within 14 days of the arbitrator being appointed, the claimant must provide both the respondent and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement of claim which describes the nature of the difference between the parties, the legal and factual issues, the claimant’s contentions as to those issues, the amount of its claim or the remedy it is seeking;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of all documents on which it relies, including contractual documentation, correspondence (including electronic documents), legal precedents and expert witness reports.
(3) Within 14 days of receipt of the claimant’s statements under sub-paragraph (2) by the arbitrator and respondent, the respondent must provide the claimant and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement of defence consisting of a response to the claimant’s statement of claim, its statement in respect of the nature of the difference, the legal and factual issues in the claimant’s claim, its acceptance of any elements of the claimant’s claim and its contentions as to those elements of the claimant’s claim it does not accept;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of all documents on which it relies, including contractual documentation, correspondence (including electronic documents), legal precedents and expert witness reports;
(c)
any objection it wishes to make to the claimant’s statements, comments on the claimant’s expert reports (if submitted by the claimant) and explanations of the objections.
(4) Within seven days of the respondent serving its statements under sub-paragraph (3), the claimant may make a statement of reply by providing both the respondent and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement responding to the respondent’s submissions, including its reply in respect of the nature of the difference, the issues (both factual and legal) and its contentions in relation to the issues;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of documents in response to the respondent’s submissions;
(c)
any expert report in response to the respondent’s submissions;
(d)
any objections to the statements of evidence, expert reports or other documents submitted by the respondent; and
(e)
its written submissions in response to the legal and factual issues involved.
Procedure
4.—(1) The parties’ pleadings, witness statements and expert reports (if any) must be concise. A single pleading must not exceed 20 single-sided A4 pages using 10pt Arial font.
(2) The arbitrator will make an award on the substantive differences based solely on the written material submitted by the parties unless the arbitrator decides that a hearing is necessary to explain or resolve any matters.
(3) Either party may, within two days of delivery of the last submission, request a hearing giving specific reasons why it considers a hearing is required.
(4) Within seven days of receiving the last submission, the arbitrator must notify the parties whether a hearing is to be held and the length of that hearing.
(5) Within ten days of the arbitrator advising the parties that a hearing is to be held, the date and venue for the hearing are to be fixed by agreement with the parties, save that if there is no agreement the arbitrator must direct a date and venue which the arbitrator considers is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. The date for the hearing must not be less than 35 days from the date of the arbitrator’s direction confirming the date and venue of the hearing.
(6) A decision must be made by the arbitrator on whether there is any need for expert evidence to be submitted orally at the hearing. If oral expert evidence is required by the arbitrator, then any experts attending the hearing may be asked questions by the arbitrator.
(7) There is to be no examination or cross-examination of experts, but the arbitrator must invite the parties to ask questions of the experts by way of clarification of any answers given by the experts in response to the arbitrator’s questions. Prior to the hearing in relation to the experts—
(a)
at least 28 days before a hearing, the arbitrator must provide a list of issues to be addressed by the experts;
(b)
if more than one expert is called, they will jointly confer and produce a joint report or reports within 14 days of the issues being provided; and
(c)
the form and content of a joint report must be as directed by the arbitrator and must be provided at least seven days before the hearing.
(8) Within 14 days of a hearing or a decision by the arbitrator that no hearing is to be held the parties may by way of exchange provide the arbitrator with a final submission in connection with the matters in dispute and any submissions on costs. The arbitrator must take these submissions into account in the award.
(9) The arbitrator may make other directions or rulings as considered appropriate in order to ensure that the parties comply with the timetable and procedures to achieve an award on the substantive difference within four months of the date on which the arbitrator is appointed, unless both parties otherwise agree to an extension to the date for the award.
(10) If a party fails to comply with the timetable, procedure or any other direction then the arbitrator may continue in the absence of a party or submission or document, and may make a decision on the information before the arbitrator attaching the appropriate weight to any evidence submitted beyond any timetable or in breach of any procedure or direction.
(11) The arbitrator’s award must include reasons. The parties must accept that the extent to which reasons are given must be proportionate to the issues in dispute and the time available to the arbitrator to deliver the award.
Arbitrator’s powers
5.—(1) The arbitrator has all the powers of the Arbitration Act 1996, save where modified in this Schedule.
(2) There must be no discovery or disclosure, except that the arbitrator is to have the power to order the parties to produce such documents as are reasonably requested by another party no later than the statement of reply, or by the arbitrator, where the documents are manifestly relevant, specifically identified and the burden of production is not excessive. Any application and orders should be made by way of a Redfern Schedule without any hearing.
(3) Any time limits fixed in accordance with this procedure or by the arbitrator may be varied by agreement between the parties, subject to any such variation being acceptable to and approved by the arbitrator. In the absence of agreement, the arbitrator may vary the timescales or procedure—
(a)
if the arbitrator is satisfied that a variation of any fixed time limit is reasonably necessary to avoid a breach of the rules of natural justice and then;
(b)
only for such a period that is necessary to achieve fairness between the parties.
(4) On the date the award is made, the arbitrator will notify the parties that the award is completed, signed and dated, and that it will be issued to the parties on receipt of cleared funds for the arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
Costs
6.—(1) The costs of the arbitration must include the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the reasonable fees and expenses of any experts and the reasonable legal and other costs incurred by the parties for the arbitration.
(2) Where the difference involves connected or interrelated issues, the arbitrator must consider the relevant costs collectively.
(3) The final award must fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties are to bear them or in what proportion they are to be borne by the parties.
(4) The arbitrator must award recoverable costs on the general principle that each party should bear its own costs, having regard to all material circumstances, including such matters as exaggerated claims or defences, the degree of success for different elements of the claims, claims that have incurred substantial costs, the conduct of the parties and the degree of success of a party.
Confidentiality
7.—(1) Hearings in this arbitration are to take place in private.
(2) Materials, documents, awards, expert reports and any matters relating to the arbitration are confidential and must not be disclosed to any third party without prior written consent of the other party, save for any application to the courts or where disclosure is required under any legislative or regulatory requirement.Article 41

PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS
PART 1
FOR THE PROTECTION OF ELECTRICITY, GAS, WATER AND SEWERAGE UNDERTAKERS
1.  For the protection of the utility undertakers referred to in this part of this Schedule (save for any utility undertakers which are specifically protected by any other Part of this Schedule, which will take precedence), the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the utility undertakers concerned.
2.  In this part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the utility undertaker in question to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means—
(a)
in the case of an electricity undertaker, electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(1)), belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker;
(b)
in the case of a gas undertaker, any mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by a gas transporter for the purposes of gas supply;
(c)
in the case of a water undertaker—
(i)
mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker for the purposes of water supply; and
(ii)

(d)
in the case of a sewerage undertaker—
(i)

and includes a sludge main, disposal main (within the meaning of section 219 of that Act) or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming part of any such sewer, drain or works, and includes any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus; and
(e)
any other mains, pipelines or cables that are not the subject of the protective provisions in Parts 2 to 16 of this Schedule;

for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained.
3.  This part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
4.  Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary closure of streets and public rights of way), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
11.  Nothing in this part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaking in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

If in consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable West Burton to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before the obstruction.
53.  The undertaker must not exercise the powers conferred by this Order to prevent or interfere with the access by West Burton to the West Burton Work No. 5B Area.
54.  To ensure its compliance with this Part, the undertaker must before carrying out any works or operations pursuant to this Order within West Burton Work No. 5B Area request up-to-date written confirmation from West Burton of the location of any apparatus or proposed apparatus.
55.  The undertaker and West Burton must each act in good faith and use reasonable endeavours to co-operate with, and provide assistance to, each other as may be required to give effect to the provisions of this Part.
56.  The undertaker must pay to West Burton the reasonable expenses incurred by West Burton in connection with the approval of plans, inspection of any specified works or the alteration or protection of any apparatus or the West Burton Work No. 5B Area.
57.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any specified works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by West Burton, or West Burton becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by West Burton in making good such damage or restoring the service or supply; and
(b)
compensate West Burton for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from West Burton, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or West Burton becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of West Burton, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) West Burton must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise shall be made, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme without first consulting the undertaker and considering its representations.
(4) West Burton must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 57 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, West Burton shall provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 57 for claims reasonably incurred by West Burton.
(5) The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done with the consent of West Burton and in accordance with any conditions or restrictions prescribed by West Burton or in accordance with any plans approved by West Burton or to its satisfaction or in accordance with any directions or award of any arbitrator does not relieve the undertaker from any liability under this Part.
58.  Any dispute arising between the undertaker and West Burton under this Part must be determined by arbitration under article 40 (arbitration).

includes a sludge main, disposal main or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming part of any such sewer, drain or works, and includes any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus;
and for the purpose of this definition, where words are defined by section 219 of that Act, they are taken to have the same meaning
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in”, in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land, includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land; and
“plan” includes all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably necessary properly and sufficiently to describe the works to be executed.
On street apparatus
61.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and Anglian Water are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus in temporarily closed streets
62.  Regardless of the temporary closure or diversion of any highway under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary closure of streets and public rights of way), Anglian Water is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such temporarily closed highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the closure or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
63.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 16 (protective works to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
Acquisition of land
64.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
65.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that Anglian Water’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of Anglian Water to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until:
(a)
alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (8); and
(b)
facilities and rights have been secured for that alternative apparatus in accordance with paragraph 66.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to Anglian Water 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Anglian Water the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed Anglian Water must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Anglian Water and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(5) Anglian Water must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration), and after the grant to Anglian Water of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if Anglian Water gives notice in writing to the undertaker that it desires the undertaker to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker or to the extent that Anglian Water fails to proceed with that work in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or the undertaker and Anglian Water otherwise agree, that work, instead of being executed by Anglian Water, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay and to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water.
(7) If Anglian Water fails either reasonably to approve, or to provide reasons for its failure to approve along with an indication of what would be required to make acceptable, any proposed details relating to required removal works under sub-paragraph (2) within 28 days of receiving a notice of the required works from the undertaker, then such details are deemed to have been approved. For the avoidance of doubt, any such “deemed consent” does not extend to the actual undertaking of the removal works, which must remain the sole responsibility of Anglian Water or its contractors unless these works are to be carried out by the undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (6).
(8) Whenever alternative apparatus is to be or is being substituted for existing apparatus, the undertaker must, before taking or requiring any further step in such substitution works, use reasonable endeavours to comply with Anglian Water’s reasonable requests for a reasonable period of time to enable Anglian Water to:
(a)
make network contingency arrangements; or
(b)
bring such matters as it may consider reasonably necessary to the attention of end users of the utility in question.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
66.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Anglian Water or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Anglian Water than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Anglian Water as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
(3) Such facilities and rights as are set out in this paragraph are deemed to include any statutory permits granted to the undertaker in respect of the apparatus in question, whether under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 or other legislation.
Retained apparatus
67.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus (or any means of access to it) the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 65(2), the undertaker must submit to Anglian Water a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Anglian Water for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Anglian Water is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Anglian Water under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If Anglian Water in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 59 to 61 and 64 to 66 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 65(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give to Anglian Water notice as soon as is reasonably practicable a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances, using its best endeavours to keep the impact of those emergency works on Anglian Water’s apparatus, on the operation of its water and sewerage network and on end-users of the services Anglian Water provides to a minimum.
(7) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) and without prejudice to the generality of the principles set out in that sub-paragraph, works are deemed to be in land near Anglian Water’s apparatus (where it is a pipe) if those works fall within the following distances measured from the medial line of such apparatus:
(a)
4 metres where the diameter of the pipe is less than 250 millimetres;
(b)
5 metres where the diameter of the pipe is between 250 and 400 millimetres; and
(c)
a distance to be agreed on a case by case basis and before the submission of the Plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted where the diameter of the pipe exceeds 400 millimetres.
Expenses and costs
68.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Anglian Water all expenses reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under subparagraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Anglian Water by virtue of subparagraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
69.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 63 or 65(2), or by reason of any subsidence resulting from such development or works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Anglian Water, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Anglian Water, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Anglian Water, accompanied by an invoice or claim from Anglian Water, in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Anglian Water for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Anglian Water on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Anglian Water or in accordance with any requirement of Anglian Water or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Anglian Water fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and professional like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the unlawful or unreasonable act, neglect or default of Anglian Water, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) Anglian Water must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made, without the consent of the undertaker (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(5) Anglian Water must use reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which the undertaker must bear and pay the costs for.
Cooperation
70.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, the undertaker or Anglian Water requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 65(2) or Anglian Water makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 67(2), the undertaker must use all reasonable endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Anglian Water’s undertaking, using existing processes where requested by Anglian Water, provided it is appropriate to do so, and Anglian Water must use all reasonable endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
71.  Where the undertaker identifies any apparatus which they have reason to believe may belong to or be maintainable by Anglian Water but which does not appear on any statutory map kept for the purpose by Anglian Water, it must inform Anglian Water of the existence and location of the apparatus as soon as reasonably practicable.
72.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Anglian Water in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
73.  The undertaker and Anglian Water may by written agreement substitute any period of time for those periods set out in this Part of this Schedule.

No acquisition except by agreement
77.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
78.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of NGED to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed, alternative rights acquired or granted for the alternative apparatus and the alternative apparatus is in operation and access to it has been provided if necessary to the reasonable satisfaction of NGED in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (10) or with such alternative or supplementary provisions as the undertaker and NGED may agree between them.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to NGED written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) If as a consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order NGED reasonably needs to remove or divert any of its apparatus and the removal of that apparatus has not been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) then NGED must give to the undertaker written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and this Part has effect as if the removal or diversion of such apparatus had been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (2).
(4) If as a consequence of the removal or diversion of apparatus under sub-paragraph (2) or (3) alternative apparatus is to be constructed in land owned or controlled by the undertaker then the undertaker must afford to NGED the necessary facilities and alternative rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in the other land owned or controlled by the undertaker as reasonably required by the NGED.
(5) If the undertaker or NGED requires to remove or divert any apparatus placed within the Order land and alternative apparatus is to be constructed in land not owned or controlled by the undertaker as a consequence of the removal or diversion of apparatus then NGED shall use its reasonable endeavours to obtain alternative rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(6) If alternative apparatus is to be constructed in land not owned or controlled by the undertaker and NGED is unable to obtain such alternative rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker and NGED shall consider whether there is an alternative engineering solution that can achieve the diversion without the need for the use of compulsory powers. Should such an alternative engineering solution not be practicable and deliverable in a reasonable timescale and at a reasonable cost (which shall be determined by the undertaker acting reasonably), NGED may but shall not be compelled to use the powers of compulsory acquisition set out in this Order or the Electricity Act 1989 to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed in accordance with a timetable agreed between NGED and the undertaker.
(7) Any alternative apparatus required pursuant to sub-paragraphs (2) or (3)) must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between NGED and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(8) NGED must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled in accordance with paragraph 83, and after the acquisition by or grant to NGED of any such facilities and alternative rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) to (6), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(9) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (8), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to NGED that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by NGED, must be executed by the undertaker—
(a)
in accordance with plans and specifications and in such line or situation agreed between the undertaker and NGED, or, in default of agreement, determined in accordance with paragraph 83; and
(b)
without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of NGED.
(10) Nothing in sub-paragraph (9) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus or alternative apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus or alternative apparatus (where the apparatus or alternative apparatus is laid in a trench) within 600 millimetres of the point of connection or disconnection.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
79.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to NGED facilities and alternative rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and alternative rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and NGED or in default of agreement settled in accordance with paragraph 83.
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in the land of the undertaker, the expert must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised development and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the undertaker;
(b)
have regard to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted;
(c)
have regard to NGED’s ability to fulfil its service obligations and comply with its licence conditions; and
(d)
have regard to the standard form rights NGED ordinarily secures for the type of alternative apparatus to be constructed in the circumstances similar to the authorised development.
(3) If the facilities and alternative rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and alternative rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the expert less favourable on the whole to NGED than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the expert must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to NGED as appears to the expert to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
80.—(1) Not less than 60 days before the undertaker intends to start the execution of any specified work where the removal of the apparatus in question has not been required under paragraph 78 (removal of apparatus), the undertaker shall submit to NGED a plan of the works to be executed. Any submission must note the time limits imposed on NGED under sub-paragraph (3).
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below the undertaker shall not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (1) applies until NGED has identified any reasonable requirements it has for the alteration or protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it.
(3) If by the expiry of 60 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted NGED has not advised the undertaker in writing of any reasonable requirements for the alteration or protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, it shall be deemed not to have any such requirements and the undertaker shall be at liberty to proceed with the works.
(4) The works referred to in sub-paragraph (1) must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with any reasonable requirements as may be notified in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) by NGED and NGED shall be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(5) At all times when carrying out the authorised development the undertaker must comply with NGED’s Avoidance of Danger from Electricity Overhead Lines and Underground Cables (2014), the Energy Network Association’s A Guide to the Safe Use of Mechanical Plant in the Vicinity of Electricity Overhead Lines (undated), the Health and Safety Executive’s GS6 Avoiding Danger from Overhead Power Lines and the Health and Safety Executive’s HSG47 Avoiding Danger from Underground Services (Third Edition) (2014) as the same may be replaced from time to time.
(6) If NGED, in accordance with sub–paragraph (2) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal or diversion of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, this Part of this Schedule applies as if the removal or diversion of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 78(2) (removal of apparatus).
(7) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 60 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(8) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub–paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to NGED notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with any reasonable requirements stipulated by NGED under sub-paragraph (2) and with sub–paragraphs (4) and (5) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. Nothing in this sub-paragraph prevents NGED from exercising its rights under sub-paragraph (6).
Expenses and costs
81.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to NGED the reasonable expenses incurred by NGED in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, diversion, alteration or protection of any apparatus, the construction of any alternative apparatus and the acquisition or grant of alternative rights for the alternative apparatus, arising as a result of the powers conferred upon the undertaker pursuant to this Order.
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule NGED requires that alternative apparatus of better type, of greater capacity, of greater dimensions or at a greater depth is necessary in substitution for existing apparatus which for NGED’s network requirements is over and above what is necessary as a consequence of and for the purpose of the authorised development, NGED shall reduce the cost of such additional requirements from the amount payable by the undertaker pursuant to sub-paragraph (1).
(4) For the purposes of sub–paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the authorised development; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

Agency access
92.  If by reason of construction of the specified work the Agency’s access to flood defences or equipment maintained for flood defence purposes is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access that will allow the Agency to maintain the flood defence or use the equipment no less effectively than was possible before the obstruction within 24 hours of or as soon as reasonably practicable after the undertaker becoming aware of such obstruction.
Free passage of fish
93.—(1) The undertaker must take all such measures as may be reasonably practicable to prevent any interruption of the free passage of fish in the fishery during the construction of any specified work.
(2) If by reason of—
(a)
the construction of any specified work; or
(b)
the failure of any such work,
damage to the fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the Agency may serve notice on the undertaker requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage, or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.
(3) If within such time as may be reasonably practicable for that purpose after the receipt of written notice from the Agency of any damage or expected damage to a fishery, the undertaker fails to take such steps as are described in sub-paragraph (2), the Agency may take those steps and any expenditure incurred by the Agency in so doing is recoverable from the undertaker.
(4) In any case where immediate action by the Agency is reasonably required in order to secure that the risk of damage to the fishery is avoided or reduced, the Agency may take such steps as are reasonable for the purpose, and may recover from the undertaker any expenditure incurred in so doing provided that notice specifying those steps is served on the undertaker as soon as reasonably practicable after the Agency has taken, or commenced to take, the steps specified in the notice.

Apparatus of National Grid in temporarily closed streets and public rights of way
100.—(1) Where any street or public right of way is temporarily closed under article 11 (temporary closure of streets and public rights of way), if National Grid has any apparatus in the street or public right of way or accessed via that street or public right of way National Grid has the same rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the temporary closure and the undertaker must grant to National Grid, or procure the granting to National Grid of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to National Grid in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the temporary closure of any such street or public right of way but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or National Grid to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 103 or the power of the undertaker, subject to compliance with this sub-paragraph, to carry out works under paragraph 105.
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary closure or diversion of a street or public right of way under the powers of article 11 (temporary closure of streets and public rights of way), National Grid is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street or public right of way and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street or public right of way as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the temporary closure or diversion was in that street or public right of way.
Protective works to buildings
101.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 16 (protective work to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of National Grid.
Acquisition of land
102.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker may not (a) appropriate or acquire or take temporary possession of any land or apparatus belonging to National Grid or (b) appropriate, acquire, extinguish, interfere with or override any easement, other interest or right or apparatus of National Grid, otherwise than by agreement (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld).
(2) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised development (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of National Grid or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Grid and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Grid reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid unless otherwise agreed by National Grid, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure or secure (or both) the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised development.
(3) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid or other enactments relied upon by National Grid as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule will prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 105 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, are not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
103.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by the Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any Order land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), secure any necessary consents for the alternative apparatus and afford to National Grid to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 104 below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid may in its sole discretion, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to assist the undertaker to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to do so.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker.
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to a written diversion agreement having been entered into between the parties and the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
104.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Grid facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Grid.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 111 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: Protection of National Grid as Electricity Undertaker
105.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works, the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan of the works to be executed and seek from National Grid details of the underground extent of their electricity assets.
(2) In relation to the specified works the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—

(4) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (2) or (3) apply until National Grid has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(5) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (6) or (8); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) apply, National Grid may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works executed under sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (6) as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) or (8) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where National Grid requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and National Grid must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, sub-paragraphs (1) to (4) and (6) to (8) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 103(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of any specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and comply with sub-paragraph (12) at all times.
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under this Order, the undertaker must comply with National Grid’s policies for development near overhead lines EN43-8 and the Health and Safety Executive’s guidance note 6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Lines”.
Expenses
106.—(1) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Grid and the undertaker and subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid within 30 days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim from National Grid all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised development including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 103(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 111 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
107.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works (including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works), any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from National Grid the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any third party.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (2) unless National Grid fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) is to impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any authorised development and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by National Grid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the 2008 Act or article 33 (consent to transfer the benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised development yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph 107(3)(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 107; or
(c)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working or business interruption) arising from any such damage or interruption which is not reasonably foreseeable.
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme without first consulting the undertaker and considering its representations.
(5) National Grid must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within National Grid’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Grid’s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker National Grid must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
(7) Not to commence construction (and not to permit the commencement of such construction) of the authorised works on any land owned by National Grid or in respect of which National Grid has an easement or wayleave for its apparatus or any other interest or to carry out any works within 15 metres of National Grid’s apparatus until the following conditions are satisfied:
(a)
unless and until National Grid is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has first provided the acceptable security (and provided evidence that it shall maintain such acceptable security for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and National Grid has confirmed the same to the undertaker in writing; and
(b)
unless and until National Grid is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to National Grid that it shall maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and National Grid has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker.
(8) In the event that the undertaker fails to comply with sub-paragraph (7) of this Part of this Schedule, nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall prevent National Grid from seeking injunctive relief (or any other equitable remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Enactments and agreements
108.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
109.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or National Grid requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 103(2) or National Grid makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 105, the undertaker is to use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Grid’s undertaking and National Grid is to use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever National Grid’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
110.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 102 or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
111.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraphs 103(2), 103(4), 104 and 105 any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Grid under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
Notices
112.  Notwithstanding article 4 (service of notices), any plans submitted to National Grid by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 105 must be submitted using the LSBUD system (https://lsbud.co.uk/) or to such other address as National Grid may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker in writing.

(4) When signifying their approval of the plans the engineer may specify any protective works (whether temporary or permanent) which in the engineer’s opinion should be carried out before the commencement of the construction of a specified work to ensure the safety or stability of railway property or the continuation of safe and efficient operation of the railways of Network Rail or the services of operators using the same (including any relocation de-commissioning and removal of works, apparatus and equipment necessitated by a specified work and the comfort and safety of passengers who may be affected by the specified works), and such protective works as may be reasonably necessary for those purposes must be constructed by Network Rail or by the undertaker, if Network Rail so desires, and such protective works must be carried out at the expense of the undertaker in either case without unnecessary delay and the undertaker must not commence the construction of the specified works until the engineer has notified the undertaker that the protective works have been completed to their reasonable satisfaction.
118.—(1) Any specified work and any protective works to be constructed by virtue of paragraph 117(4), must, when commenced, be constructed—
(a)
without unnecessary delay in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to have been approved or settled under paragraph 117;
(b)
under the supervision (where appropriate and if given) and to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer;
(c)
in such manner as to cause as little damage as is possible to railway property; and
(d)
so far as is reasonably practicable, so as not to interfere with or obstruct the free, uninterrupted and safe use of any railway of Network Rail or the traffic thereon and the use by passengers of railway property.
(2) If any damage to railway property or any such interference or obstruction shall be caused by the carrying out of, or in consequence of the construction of a specified work, the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval, make good such damage and must pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may sustain by reason of any such damage, interference or obstruction.
(3) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of Network Rail or its servants, contractors or agents or any liability on Network Rail with respect of any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of the undertaker or its servants, contractors or agents.
119.  The undertaker must—
(a)
at all times afford reasonable facilities to the engineer for access to a specified work during its construction; and

(a)
in constructing any part of a specified work on behalf of the undertaker as provided by paragraph 117(3) or in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 117(4) including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signallers, watch-persons and other persons whom it shall be reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer, require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or from the substitution or diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work.
123.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
“Network Rail’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised development) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 117(1) for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)–
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 117(1) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 117(1) has effect subject to the sub-paragraph.
(6) Prior to the commencement of operation of the authorised development the undertaker shall test the use of the authorised development in a manner that shall first have been agreed with Network Rail and if, notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing of the authorised development causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.

Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(c)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus or such EMI; and
(d)
the undertaker shall not allow the use or operation of the authorised development in a manner that has caused or will cause EMI until measures have been taken in accordance with this paragraph to prevent EMI occurring.
(8) Where Network Rail approves modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus pursuant to sub-paragraphs (5) or (6)—
(a)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail’s apparatus;
(b)
any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus approved pursuant to those sub-paragraphs must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 118.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 127 applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses suffered by Network Rail through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Network Rail’s apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which sub-paragraph (6) applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 122(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph shall be deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
124.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.

FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE CANAL & RIVER TRUST
Interpretation
135.—(1) For the protection of the Canal & River Trust the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the Canal & River Trust.
(2) In this Part of this Schedule—
“Code of Practice” means the Code of Practice for Works Affecting the Canal & River Trust (April 2023) or any updates or amendments thereto;
“construction”, in relation to any specified work or protective work, includes—
(a)

(b)
the erosion of the bed or banks of the waterway, or the impairment of the stability of any works, lands or premises forming part of the waterway;
(c)
the deposit of materials or the siltation of the waterway so as to damage the waterway;
(d)
the pollution of the waterway;
(e)
any significant alteration in the water level of the waterway, or significant interference with the supply of water thereto, or drainage of water therefrom;
(f)
any harm to the ecology of the waterway; and
(g)
any interference with the exercise by any person of any lawful rights over Canal & River Trust’s network;
“the engineer” means an engineer appointed by the Canal & River Trust for the purpose in question;
“plans” includes navigational risk assessments, sections, designs, drawings, specifications, soil reports, calculations, descriptions (including descriptions of methods of construction) and programmes;
“practical completion” means practical completion of all of the specified work notwithstanding that items which would ordinarily be considered snagging items remain outstanding, and the expression “practically complete” and “practically completed” is to be construed accordingly;
“protective work” means a work constructed under paragraph 139 below, (approval of plans etc.), sub-paragraph 139(4)(a);
“specified work” means so much of the authorised development as is, may be, or takes place in, on, under or over the surface of land below the water level forming part of the waterway; or may affect the waterway or any function of the Trust, including any projection over the waterway by any authorised work or any plant or machinery;
“the waterway” means each and every part of the River Trent within the order limits and includes any works, lands or premises belonging to the Canal & River Trust, or under its management or control, and held or used by the Canal & River Trust in connection with its statutory functions.
(3) Where the Code of Practice applies to any works or matters that are part of the authorised development or that form part of the protective works and there is an inconsistency between these protective provisions and the Code of Practice, the part of the Code of Practice that is inconsistent with these protective provisions will not apply and these protective provisions will apply. The undertaker will identify and agree with the Canal & River Trust those parts of the Code of Practice which are not applicable to the construction of the specified works and for the avoidance of doubt the undertaker will not be required to comply with those agreed parts of the Code of Practice.
Powers requiring the Canal & River Trust’s consent
136.—(1) The undertaker must not in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order obstruct or interfere with pedestrian or vehicular access to the waterway unless such obstruction or interference with such access is with the consent of the Canal & River Trust.
(2) The undertaker must not exercise any power conferred by this Order to discharge water into the waterway under article 15 (discharge of water) or in any way interfere with the supply of water to or the drainage of water from the waterway unless such exercise is with the consent of the Canal & River Trust, save as to surface water discharge which will not require the consent of the Canal & River Trust.
(3) The undertaker must not exercise the powers conferred by article 17 (authority to survey and investigate the land) or section 11(3) of the 1965 Act, in relation to the waterway unless such exercise is with the consent of the Canal & River Trust.

(6) The consent of the Canal & River Trust pursuant to sub-paragraphs (1) to (5) must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed but may be given subject to reasonable terms and conditions provided that it will not be reasonable for the Canal & River Trust to withhold or delay consent or impose terms and conditions that would prevent the undertaker from complying with the protective provisions in this Part of this Schedule or any condition contained in Schedule 2 (requirements) to this Order.
Fencing
137.  Where so required by the engineer acting reasonably the undertaker must, to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer, fence off a specified work or a protective work or take such other steps as the engineer may require to be taken for the purpose of separating a specified work or a protective work from the waterway, whether on a temporary or permanent basis or both.
Survey of waterway
138.—(1) Before the commencement of the initial construction of any part of the specified works and again following practical completion of the specified works the undertaker must bear the reasonable and proper cost of the carrying out by a qualified engineer (the “surveyor”), to be approved by the Canal & River Trust and the undertaker, of a survey to measure the navigational depth of the waterway and profile of the riverbed (“the survey”) of so much of the waterway and of any land which may provide support for the waterway as will or may be affected by the specified works.
(2) The design of, and methods proposed to be used for, the survey, to be approved by the Canal & River Trust and the undertaker.
(3) For the purposes of the survey the undertaker must—
(a)
on being given reasonable notice (save in case of emergency, when immediate access must be afforded) afford reasonable facilities to the surveyor for access to the site of the specified works and to any land of the undertaker which may provide support for the waterway as will or may be affected by the specified works; and
(b)
supply the surveyor as soon as reasonably practicable with all such information as they may reasonably require and which the undertaker holds with regard to the specified works or the method of their construction.
(4) Copies of the survey results must be provided to both the Canal & River Trust and the undertaker at no cost to the Canal & River Trust.
Approval of plans, protective works etc.
139.—(1) The undertaker must before commencing construction of any specified work including any temporary works supply to the Canal & River Trust proper and sufficient plans of that work, on the Canal & River Trust forms, having regard to the Canal & River Trust’s Code of Practice and such further particulars available to it as the Canal & River Trust may within 14 working days of the submission of the plans reasonably require for the approval of the engineer and must not commence such construction of a specified work until plans of that work have been approved in writing by the engineer or settled by arbitration.
(2) The approval of the engineer under sub-paragraph (1) must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and if within 25 working days after such plans (including any other particulars reasonably required under sub-paragraph (1)) have been received by the Canal & River Trust the engineer has not intimated disapproval of those plans and the grounds of disapproval, the engineer is deemed to have approved the plans as submitted.
(3) An approval of the engineer under this paragraph 139 is not deemed to have been unreasonably withheld if approval within the time limited by sub-paragraph (2) has not been given pending the outcome of any consultation on the approval in question that the Canal & River Trust is obliged to carry out in the proper exercise of its functions, provided prior written notice of such consultation has been provided by the Canal & River Trust to the undertaker.
(4) When signifying approval of the plans the engineer may specify on land held or controlled by the Canal & River Trust or the undertaker and subject to such works being authorised by this Order or being development permitted by an Act of Parliament or general development order made under the 1990 Act—
(a)
any protective work (whether temporary or permanent) which in the reasonable opinion of the engineer should be carried out before the commencement of a specified work to prevent detriment; and
(b)
such other requirements as may be reasonably necessary to prevent detriment;
and such protective works must be constructed by the undertaker or by the Canal & River Trust at the undertaker’s request with all reasonable dispatch and the undertaker must not commence the construction of a specified work until the engineer has notified the undertaker that the protective works have been completed to the engineer’s reasonable satisfaction such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) The withholding of an approval of the engineer under this paragraph 139 will be deemed to be unreasonable if it would prevent the undertaker from complying with any condition contained in Schedule 2 (requirements) to this Order.
(6) The undertaker must pay to the Canal & River Trust a capitalised sum representing any reasonably increased and additional cost of maintaining and, when necessary, renewing any works, including any permanent protective works provided under sub-paragraph (4) above, and of carrying out any additional dredging of the waterway reasonably necessitated by the exercise of any of the powers under this Order but if the cost of maintaining the waterway, or of works of renewal of the waterway, is reduced in consequence of any such works, a capitalised sum representing such reasonable saving is to be set off against any sum payable by the undertaker to the Canal & River Trust under this paragraph.
(7) In the event that the undertaker fails to complete the construction of, or part of, the specified works the Canal & River Trust may, if it is reasonably required in order to avoid detriment, serve on the undertaker a notice in writing requesting that construction be completed. Any notice served under this sub-paragraph must state the works that are to be completed by the undertaker and lay out a reasonable timetable for the works’ completion. If the undertaker fails to comply with this notice within 35 working days, the Canal & River Trust may construct any of the specified works, or part of such works, (together with any adjoining works) in order to complete the construction of, or part of, the specified works or make such works and the undertaker must reimburse the Canal & River Trust all costs, fees, charges and expenses it has reasonably incurred in carrying out such works.

(a)
the design of the specified works;
(b)
the environmental effects of those works; and must have regard to such views as may be expressed by the Canal & River Trust in response to such consultation pursuant in particular to the requirements imposed on the Canal & River Trust by section 22 (general environmental and recreational duties) of the British Waterways Act 1995 and to the interest of the Canal & River Trust in preserving and enhancing the environment of its waterways; and
(c)
amendments or alterations to the construction environmental management plan, landscape and ecological management plan, operational environmental management plan, decommissioning environmental management plan (as may be approved pursuant to Schedule 2) in respect of a specified work or a protective work or otherwise in connection with the waterway.
Notice of works
141.  The undertaker must give to the engineer 30 days’ notice of its intention to commence the construction of any of the specified works or protective works, or, in the case of repair carried out in an emergency, such notice as may be reasonably practicable so that, in particular, the Canal & River Trust may where appropriate arrange for the publication of notices bringing those works to the attention of users of the Canal & River Trust’s network.
Construction of specified works
142.—(1) Any specified works or protective works must, when commenced, be constructed—
(a)
with all reasonable dispatch in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to have been approved or settled as aforesaid and with any specifications made under paragraph 139 (approval of plans etc) and paragraph 140 (design of works) of this Part;
(b)
under the supervision (if given) and to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer;
(c)
in such manner as to cause as little detriment to the waterway as is reasonably practicable;

(2) Nothing in this Order authorises the undertaker to make or maintain any permanent works in or over the waterway so as to impede or prevent (whether by reducing the width of the waterway or otherwise) the passage of any vessel which is of a kind (as to its dimensions) for which the Canal & River Trust is required by section 105(1)(b) and (2) of the Transport Act 1968 to maintain the waterway.
(3) Following the completion of the construction of the specified works the undertaker must restore the waterway to a condition no less satisfactory than its condition immediately prior to the commencement of those works unless otherwise agreed between the undertaker and the Canal & River Trust and save to the extent that any deterioration to the condition of the waterway is not caused by the construction of the specified works.
(4) In assessing whether the condition of the waterway is no less satisfactory than immediately prior to the works pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the Canal & River Trust and the undertaker must take account of any survey issued pursuant to paragraph 138 (survey of waterway) and any other information agreed between them pursuant to this Part.
Prevention of pollution
143.  The undertaker must not in the course of constructing a specified work or a protective work or otherwise in connection therewith do or permit anything which may result in the pollution of the waterway or the deposit of materials therein (unless otherwise permitted by the Order or the protective provisions in this Part of this Schedule) and must take such steps as the engineer may reasonably require to avoid or make good any breach of its obligations under this paragraph.

(2) If the cost of maintaining, working or renewing the waterway is reduced in consequence of any such alterations or additions a capitalised sum representing such saving is to be set off against any sum payable by the undertaker to the Canal & River Trust under this paragraph.
Repayment of the Canal & River Trust’s fees, etc.
146.—(1) The undertaker must repay to the Canal & River Trust in accordance with the Code of Practice all fees, costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred by the Canal & River Trust—
(a)
in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 139 (approval of plans etc) sub-paragraph 139(4)(a);
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction or repair of a specified work and any protective works;
(c)

(d)
in bringing the specified works or any protective works to the notice of users of the Canal & River Trust’s network; and
(e)
in constructing and/or carrying out any measures related to any specified works or protective works which are reasonably required by the Canal & River Trust to ensure the safe navigation of the waterway save that nothing is to require the Canal & River Trust to construct and/or carry out any measures.
(2) If the Canal & River Trust considers that a fee, charge, cost or expense will be payable by the undertaker pursuant to sub-paragraph (1), the Canal & River Trust will first provide an estimate of that fee, charge, cost or expense and supporting information in relation to the estimate to the undertaker along with a proposed timescale for payment for consideration and the undertaker may, within a period of 14 working days—
(a)
provide confirmation to the Canal & River Trust that the estimate is agreed and pay to the Canal & River Trust, by the date stipulated, that fee, charge, cost or expense; or

the undertaker reasonably requires the removal of any Apparatus; or
(b)
Exolum reasonably requires the removal of any Apparatus;
then the relevant party must give written notice of that requirement to the other.
(2) The parties must use their reasonable endeavours to produce a plan of the work proposed and a plan of the proposed position of the Alternative Apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) The undertaker must afford to Exolum the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of Alternative Apparatus and subsequently the grant of Alternative Rights in accordance with paragraph 155.
(4) Any Alternative Apparatus is to be constructed in land owned by the undertaker or in land in respect of which Alternative Rights have been or are guaranteed to be granted to Exolum. The Alternative Apparatus must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Exolum and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(5) After the details for the works for Alternative Apparatus to be provided or constructed have been agreed or settled in accordance with article 40 (arbitration), and after the grant to Exolum of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (4), Exolum must proceed as soon as reasonably practicable using reasonable endeavours to construct and bring into operation the Alternative Apparatus and subsequently to remove (or if agreed between the parties to allow the undertaker to remove) any redundant Apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) The following sub-paragraphs (7) and (8) only apply if:
(a)
Exolum fails to comply with its obligations under sub-paragraph (5) to remove any redundant Apparatus; and
(b)
the undertaker has served notice on Exolum specifying the default; and
(c)
Exolum has failed to remedy the default within 28 days.
(7) In the circumstances set out in sub-paragraph (6), if the undertaker then gives notice in writing to Exolum that it desires itself to remove the redundant Apparatus, that work, instead of being executed by Exolum, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Exolum.
(8) Nothing in sub-paragraph (7) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any Apparatus, or execute any filling around the Apparatus (where the Apparatus is laid in a trench) within 3000 millimetres of the Apparatus unless that Apparatus is redundant and disconnected from Exolum’s remaining system.

(2) Alternative Rights must be granted before any Alternative Apparatus is brought into use.
(3) The parties agree that the undertaker must use reasonable endeavours to procure the grant of the Alternative Rights by way of a 999 year sub-soil lease, substantially in the form of Exolum’s precedent from time to time as amended by written agreement between the parties acting reasonably, or such other form of agreement as the parties otherwise agree acting reasonably.
(4) Nothing in this Schedule or contained in the Alternative Rights require Exolum to divert or remove any Alternative Apparatus.
(5) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any Alternative Apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of Exolum less favourable on the whole to Exolum than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the Apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, Exolum may refer the matter to arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
Retained Apparatus and Alternative Apparatus: protection
156.—(1) Before commencing the execution of any Restricted Works, the undertaker must submit to Exolum a Plan of the works to be executed and any other information that Exolum may reasonably require to allow Exolum to assess the works.

the continuing safety and operational viability of any Apparatus;
(b)
the requirement for Exolum to have reasonable access with or without vehicles to inspect, repair, replace, maintain and ensure the continuing safety and operation or viability of any Apparatus; and
(c)
the requirement for Exolum to be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of Restricted Works to ensure the continuing safety and operational viability of any Apparatus and ensure compliance with the agreed Plan;
providing such reasonable requirements will be notified to the undertaker in writing.
(4) Where reasonably required by either party, in view of the complexity of any proposed works, timescales, phasing or costs, the parties must with due diligence and good faith negotiate a works agreement for the carrying out of Protective Works or the installation of Alternative Apparatus.
(5) If in consequence of the works notified to Exolum by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1), the circumstances in paragraph 154 apply, then the parties must follow the procedure in paragraph 154 onwards.
(6) Nothing in sub-paragraphs (1) to (5) precludes the undertaker from submitting prior to the commencement of works to protect retained Apparatus or to construct Alternative Apparatus (unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Exolum) a new Plan, instead of the Plan previously submitted, in which case the parties must re-run the procedure from sub-paragraph (1) onwards.
(7) Where Exolum reasonably requires Protective Works, the parties must use their reasonable endeavours to produce a plan of the work proposed and a plan of the proposed position of any physical features to be provided or constructed.
(8) The undertaker must afford to Exolum the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of Protective Works and subsequently the grant of Additional Rights in accordance with paragraph 155.
(9) Any Protective Works are to be constructed in land owned by the undertaker or in land in respect of which Additional Rights have been or are guaranteed to be granted to Exolum. The Protective Works must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Exolum and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(10) After the details for the Protective Works to be provided or constructed have been agreed or settled in accordance with article 40 (arbitration), and after the grant to Exolum of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in paragraph 154(3), Exolum must proceed as soon as reasonably practicable using reasonable endeavours to construct and bring into operation the Protective Works.

(a)
the Authorised Development might interfere with the cathodic protection forming part of Apparatus; or
(b)
any Apparatus might interfere with the proposed or existing cathodic protection forming part of the Authorised Development;
Exolum and the undertaker must co-operate in undertaking the tests which they consider reasonably necessary for ascertaining the nature and extent of such interference and measures for providing or preserving cathodic protection.

180.  To ensure its compliance with this Part, the undertaker must before carrying out any works or operations pursuant to this Order within Tillbridge Work No. 4E Area request up-to-date written confirmation from Tillbridge of the location of any apparatus or proposed apparatus.
181.  The undertaker and Tillbridge must each act in good faith and use reasonable endeavours to co-operate with, and provide assistance to, each other as may be required to give effect to the provisions of this Part.
182.  The undertaker must pay to Tillbridge the reasonable expenses incurred by Tillbridge in connection with the approval of plans, inspection of any specified works or the alteration or protection of any apparatus or the Tillbridge Work No. 4E Area.
183.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any specified works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Tillbridge, or Tillbridge becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Tillbridge in making good such damage or restoring the service or supply; and
(b)
compensate Tillbridge for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Tillbridge, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Tillbridge becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Tillbridge, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) Tillbridge must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise shall be made, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme without first consulting the undertaker and considering its representations.
(4) Tillbridge must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 183 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, Tillbridge shall provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 183 for claims reasonably incurred by Tillbridge.
(5) The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done with the consent of Tillbridge and in accordance with any conditions or restrictions prescribed by Tillbridge or in accordance with any plans approved by Tillbridge or to its satisfaction or in accordance with any directions or award of any arbitrator does not relieve the undertaker from any liability under this Part.
184.  Any dispute arising between the undertaker and Tillbridge under this Part must be determined by arbitration under article 40 (arbitration).

On Street Apparatus
187.  Except for paragraphs 188 (apparatus of EDF in temporarily closed streets), 193 (retained apparatus: protection), 194 (expenses) and 195 (indemnity) of this Schedule which will apply in respect of the exercise of all or any powers under the Order affecting the rights and apparatus of EDF, the other provisions of this Schedule do not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and EDF are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus of EDF in temporarily closed streets
188.—(1) Where any street or public right of way is temporarily closed under article 11 (temporary closure of streets and public rights of way), if EDF has any apparatus in the street or public right of way or accessed via that street or public right of way EDF has the same rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the temporary closure and the undertaker must grant to EDF, or procure the granting to EDF of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to EDF in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the temporary closure of any such street or public right of way but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or EDF to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 191 or the power of the undertaker, subject to compliance with this sub-paragraph, to carry out works under paragraph 193.
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary closure or diversion of any street or public right of way under the powers of article 11 (temporary closure of streets and public rights of way), EDF is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street or public right of way and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the temporary closure or diversion was in that street or public right of way.
Protective works to buildings
189.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 16 (protective work to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of EDF.
Acquisition of land
190.—(1) Prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised development (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between EDF and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of EDF or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between EDF and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as EDF reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between EDF and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to EDF unless otherwise agreed by EDF, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure or secure (or both) the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised development.
(2) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between EDF and the undertaker, the undertaker and EDF agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation and/or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by EDF or other enactments relied upon by EDF as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule will prevail.
(3) In the event that the undertaker exercises any powers granted under this Order which relates to taking temporary access rights during construction over EDF’s land, EDF may ensure that it retains flexibility to alter any construction routes (within the Order limits) or to limit access for certain time periods, and may require the undertaker to pay any security and maintenance costs involved in the grant of any such rights.
Removal of apparatus
191.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of EDF to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of EDF in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to EDF advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order EDF reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), secure any necessary consents for the alternative apparatus and afford to EDF to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 192(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance, operation and decommissioning of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, EDF may in its sole discretion, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to assist the undertaker to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for EDF to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between EDF and the undertaker.
(5) EDF must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to a written diversion agreement having been entered into between the parties and the grant to EDF of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
192.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for EDF facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and EDF and must be no less favourable on the whole to EDF than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by EDF.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to EDF than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 199 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to EDF as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection
193.—(1) Not less than 60 days before the commencement of—
(a)
any specified works; or
(b)
any of the authorised development or associated activities which may in any way adversely affect the demolition of any apparatus,
the undertaker must submit to EDF a plan of the works to be executed and seek from EDF details of the underground extent of their assets.
(2) In relation to the works described in sub-paragraph (1) the plan to be submitted to EDF under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus;
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes;
(g)
a ground monitoring scheme, where required; and
(h)
an assessment of the risks to the demolition of EDF’s apparatus from the works.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (2) applies until EDF has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of EDF required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (5) or (7); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraph (2) applies, EDF may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage, including for the purpose of minimising disruption to the wider demolition works, for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works executed under sub-paragraph (2) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (5) as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and EDF and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) or (7) by EDF for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and EDF will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where EDF requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to EDF’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and EDF must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(8) If EDF in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) or (7) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 185 to 187 and 190 to 192 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 191(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised development, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to EDF notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and comply with sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(11) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order, the undertaker must comply with EDF’s HSEQ Requirement for Contractors (document reference DD STND HAS 001 and any document that replaces or supersedes it).
(12) The undertaker will no later than 28 days following receipt of written notice from EDF in accordance with this sub-paragraph, cease any works referred to in sub-paragraph (1) and vacate EDF land during planned explosive and demolition events or if EDF, acting reasonably, considers the works constitute a risk to demolition works. EDF must give written notice to the undertaker of its requirement for any such explosive or demolition events at least 28 days’ prior to the event.
Expenses
194.—(1) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between EDF and the undertaker and subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to EDF within 30 days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim from EDF all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by EDF in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised development including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by EDF in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by EDF as a consequence of EDF—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 191(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting EDF;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 199 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to EDF by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to EDF in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on EDF any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
195.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works), any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of EDF, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by EDF, or EDF becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from EDF the cost reasonably and properly incurred by EDF in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify EDF for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from EDF, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or EDF becoming liable to any third party other than arising from any default of EDF.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by EDF on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by EDF or in accordance with any requirement of EDF or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless EDF fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) is to impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of EDF, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; or
(b)
any authorised development or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by EDF as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 33 (consent to transfer the benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised development yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph 195(3)(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 195; or
(c)
any consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working or business interruption) arising from any such damage or interruption, which is not reasonably foreseeable.
(4) EDF must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) EDF must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) EDF must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within EDF’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of EDF’s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker EDF must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
(7) Not to commence construction (and not to permit the commencement of such construction) of the authorised development on any land owned by EDF or in respect of which EDF has an easement or wayleave for its apparatus or any other interest or to carry out any works within 20 metres of EDF’s apparatus until the following conditions are satisfied—
(a)
unless and until EDF is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has first provided the acceptable security (and provided evidence that it shall maintain such acceptable security for the construction period of the authorised development from the proposed date of commencement of construction of such works to the completion of those works) and EDF has confirmed the same to the undertaker in writing; and
(b)
unless and until EDF is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to EDF that it shall maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised development from the proposed date of commencement of construction of such works to the completion of those works) and EDF has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker.
(8) In the event that the undertaker fails to comply with sub-paragraph (7) of this Part of this Schedule, nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall prevent EDF from seeking injunctive relief (or any other equitable remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Enactments and agreements
196.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between EDF and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and EDF in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
197.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or EDF requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 191(2) or EDF makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 193, the undertaker shall use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of EDF’s undertaking and EDF shall use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever EDF’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
198.  If in consequence of the powers granted under this Order the access (with or without vehicles, plant or machinery) to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable EDF to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
199.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 191(2), 191(4), 192(1) and 193 any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and EDF under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and EDF, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
Notices
200.  Notwithstanding article 4 (service of notices), any plans submitted to EDF by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 193 must be submitted to EDF addressed to the company secretary and copied to the land and estates team and sent to 90 Whitfield Street, London, England, W1T 4EZ or to such other address as EDF may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker in writing.

204.  Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary closure of streets and public rights of way), the undertaker must not prevent Northern Powergrid from taking all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
205.  Regardless of any provision in the Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus or any other interest of Northern Powergrid, override any easement or other interest of Northern Powergrid, or create any new rights over that apparatus otherwise than by agreement (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, having regard to Northern Powergrid’s existing and known future requirements for such land or interests).
206.  Regardless of any provision in the Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference, the undertaker must not interfere with any communications cables or equipment used by Northern Powergrid in relation to its apparatus or acquire or interfere with rights or interest supporting the use, maintenance or renewal of such equipment other than by agreement of Northern Powergrid (such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
207.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that Northern Powergrid’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of Northern Powergrid to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided pursuant to a completed easement or other form of written agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to NPG for a tenure no less than exists to the apparatus being relocated or diverted, all to the reasonable satisfaction of Northern Powergrid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to Northern Powergrid written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by the Order Northern Powergrid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Northern Powergrid the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed:
(i)
the undertaker must in the first instance use reasonable endeavours to acquire through voluntary negotiations all necessary land interests or rights as Northern Powergrid may reasonably require for the relocation and construction of alternative apparatus and must use reasonable endeavours to procure through voluntary negotiations all necessary rights to access and maintain Northern Powergrid’s apparatus and alternative apparatus thereafter the terms of such access and maintenance to be agreed by Northern Powergrid (acting reasonably); and
(ii)
In the event that the undertaker is not able to procure the necessary land interest or rights referred to in the sub-paragraph (i) Northern Powergrid must on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker and subject to paragraph 210, as soon as reasonably practicable use reasonable endeavours to procure the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for Northern Powergrid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Northern Powergrid and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration) of the Order.
(5) Northern Powergrid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration), and after the grant to Northern Powergrid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
208.—(1) Where in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to Northern Powergrid facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Northern Powergrid or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Northern Powergrid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Northern Powergrid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
209.—(1) Not less than twenty-eight working days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under the Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 207(2), the undertaker must submit to Northern Powergrid a plan, section and description of the works to be executed and any such information as Northern Powergrid reasonably requires relating to those works.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Northern Powergrid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Northern Powergrid is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Northern Powergrid under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of twenty-eight days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If Northern Powergrid in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 207(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than fourteen working days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to Northern Powergrid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
210.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Northern Powergrid within fifty days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim the reasonable expenses incurred by Northern Powergrid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 207(2) and 207(3) including within limitation:
(i)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(ii)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(iii)
the approval of any plans which must include the review of any such plans and assessing and preparing a design for apparatus to address and accommodate the proposals of the undertaker where necessary pursuant to paragraph 209(4).
(iv)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the reasonable cost of adequately maintaining permanent protective works;
(v)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) Where any payment falls due pursuant to sub-paragraph (1), Northern Powergrid must:
(a)
provide an itemised invoice or reasonable expenses claim to the undertaker;
(b)
provide ‘reminder letters’ to the undertaker for payment to be made within the fifty days on the following days after the invoice or reasonable expenses claim to the undertaker:
(i)
15 days (‘reminder letter 1’)
(ii)
29 days (‘reminder letter 2’)
(iii)
43 days (‘reminder letter 3’)
(c)
be entitled to commence debt proceedings to recover any unpaid itemised invoice or reasonable expenses claim after fifty one days of receipt of the same where payment has not been made.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration) of this Order to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which would be payable to Northern Powergrid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess, save where it is not possible on account of reasonable project time limits communicated in a reasonable timeframe to the undertaker or supply issues to obtain the existing type of operations, capacity, dimensions or place at the existing depth.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 207(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
211.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the works referred to in paragraph 207(2) by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by it) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Northern Powergrid, or there is any interruption in any service provided by Northern Powergrid, or Northern Powergrid becomes liable to pay any amount to a third party the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Northern Powergrid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Northern Powergrid for other reasonable expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Northern Powergrid, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Northern Powergrid, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents; or
(b)
any authorised development and/or other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by Northern Powergrid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 33 (consent to transfer the benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”) any works yet to be executed by the undertaker and not falling within this paragraph will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph in respect of such new apparatus.
(3) Northern Powergrid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(4) Northern Powergrid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 211 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, Northern Powergrid must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 211 for claims reasonably incurred by Northern Powergrid.
(5) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Northern Powergrid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Northern Powergrid or in accordance with any requirement of Northern Powergrid as a consequence of the authorised development or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (2) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (5) where the undertaker fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skillful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not materially accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed between the undertaker and Northern Powergrid.
212.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Northern Powergrid in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which the Order is made.
213.  Any difference under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, unless otherwise agreed, is to be referred to and settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
214.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, the undertaker or Northern Powergrid requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 207 or otherwise or Northern Powergrid makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 209, the undertaker shall use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Northern Powergrid’s apparatus taking into account the undertaker’s desire for the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and the undertaker and Northern Powergrid shall use reasonable endeavours to cooperate with each other for these purposes.
215.  The plans submitted to Northern Powergrid by the undertaker pursuant to this Part of this Schedule must be sent to Northern Powergrid at property@northernpowergrid.com or such other address as Northern Powergrid may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify the undertaker in writing.
216.  Prior to carrying out any works within the Order limits, Northern Powergrid must give written notice of the proposed works to the undertaker, such notice to include full details of the location of the proposed works, their anticipated duration, access arrangements, depths of the works, and any other information that may impact upon the works consented by the Order.
217.  Where practicable, the undertaker and Northern Powergrid will make reasonable efforts to liaise and co-operate in respect of information that is relevant to the safe and efficient construction operation and maintenance of the authorised development. Such liaison shall be carried out where any works are—
(a)
within 15m of any above ground apparatus or
(b)
within 15m of any apparatus and are to a depth of between 0 to 4m below ground level.

(2) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Retained apparatus
224.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to Uniper at the address stated in paragraph 223, a plan in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to Uniper under sub-paragraph (1) must include all comprehensive risk assessments (including any quantitative risk assessments) and any method statement describing—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus;

(h)
any intended maintenance regimes; and
(i)
a programme of the works, including any proposed start dates and the anticipated duration of the works.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply until Uniper has given written approval of the plan so submitted and the undertaker and Uniper have used reasonable endeavours to carry out a joint site walk in the period 4 weeks before commencement of the works. The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done by the undertaker in accordance with a plan approved or deemed to be approved by Uniper, or to its satisfaction, or in accordance with any directions or award of an arbitrator, does not relieve the undertaker from any liability under this Part of this Schedule.
(4) Any approval of Uniper required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub- paragraphs (5) or (8); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (1) or (2) apply, the undertaker will provide any additional information or documentation as reasonably requested by Uniper and Uniper may require modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and (2) or as relevant sub-paragraph (4) and (5), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Uniper and in accordance with all conditions imposed under subparagraph 4(a) by Uniper for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Uniper (or its representative) will be entitled to attend any meetings related to the specified works and watch, monitor and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) If, during the carrying out of the authorised development, any aspect of the works pose a risk of interference with or loss or damage to the apparatus, the undertaker will immediately notify Uniper, in writing and submit a revised plan in respect of the affected works to Uniper for approval, and the provisions of this paragraph 224 (Retained Apparatus) will apply to, and in respect of, the revised plan. If Uniper (or its representative) identifies a potential risk of interference with or loss or damage to the apparatus while watching, monitoring or inspecting the specified works, then Uniper (or its representative) may request suspension of such works. The undertaker will then submit a revised plan in respect of the affected works to Uniper for approval, and the provisions of this paragraph 7 (Retained Apparatus) will apply to, and in respect of, the revised plan. Uniper’s (or its representative’s) failure or delay in exercising this right, or the undertaker’s failure to suspend the specified works upon request by Uniper (or its representative), will not relieve the undertaker of its responsibility for any interference with, loss of, or damage to the apparatus.
(8) Where Uniper requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Uniper’s satisfaction (acting reasonably) prior to the commencement.
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised development, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works, provided that—
(a)
in respect of danger to persons it must give to Uniper notice as soon as is reasonably practicable by calling Uniper’s emergency telephone line on 0800 389 4795 or such other telephone number notified by Uniper to the undertaker in writing; and
(b)
in respect of danger to property it shall notify Uniper in accordance with subparagraph (10)(a) above, before any emergency works are commenced by or on behalf of the undertaker, and, in each case, as soon as is reasonably practicable give to Uniper a plan of those works and must—
(i)
comply with sub-paragraphs (5), (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(ii)
comply with sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(11) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order the undertaker must comply with, and use reasonable endeavours to procure compliance by any party acting on its behalf with, all applicable law and good industry practice. The undertaker must procure that any party carrying out any works on the land on its behalf has knowledge of the apparatus, its location (including as illustrated by a site map) and procure that the obligations contained in this Part of this Schedule are adhered to by such parties working on the land on its behalf.
(12) The undertaker must prepare, and keep up-to-date, a complete set of red-lined “as-built” records of the execution of the specified works, showing the exact as-built locations, sizes and details of such works as executed. The undertaker must submit to Uniper, no later than twenty (20) business days after the completion of the specified works, all “as-built” records. Uniper may specify the number of copies of any “as built” records acting reasonably.
Removal or replacement of apparatus
225.—(1) The undertaker is not permitted to remove, move or replace any apparatus in land without the prior written consent of Uniper (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
(2) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by the Order, the undertaker has exercised its compulsory purchase powers to acquire any interest in or possesses temporarily any Order land in which any apparatus is placed and has the power to move, replace or remove that apparatus, it must not do so under this Part of this Schedule and any right of Uniper to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of Uniper in accordance with sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) inclusive.
(3) If, for the purpose of executing any specified works in, on, under or over any land held, appropriated or used under this Order pursuant to exercising its compulsory purchase powers the undertaker requires the replacement or removal of any apparatus placed in that land it must give to Uniper no less than 56 days advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and where applicable, the proposed replacement apparatus or the position of any alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case provided that where:
(a)
the undertaker requires the replacement of any apparatus placed in that land, it must be replaced with identical apparatus, provided that if identical apparatus is not available, it must be either—
(i)
replaced with apparatus on a similar or equivalent basis (i.e. like-for-like basis); or
(ii)
where it cannot be replaced on a similar or equivalent basis, then it must be replaced with enhanced apparatus. For the avoidance of doubt, no apparatus will be replaced with anything less advanced than the apparatus being replaced.
(b)
the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Uniper reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) Uniper must, subject to sub-paragraph (4), secure any necessary consents for the alternative apparatus and afford to Uniper to its satisfaction the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by Uniper and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus, and prior to any removal or any replacement of the apparatus pursuant to this paragraph 8, the parties must agree the value attributable to such apparatus or alternative apparatus, prior to any replacement or removal. If such value cannot be agreed between the parties, such value will be determined in accordance with paragraph 13 (arbitration).
(4) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (3), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker must take all steps required in the circumstances to assist Uniper to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(5) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the undertaker and Uniper.
(6) Uniper must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to a written agreement having been entered into between the parties and the grant to Uniper of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (3) or (4), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Expenses
226.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Uniper within 30 days of receipt of an invoice, all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by Uniper in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration, repair, remediation or restoration of or protection of any apparatus or alternative apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any powers conferred on the undertaker, pursuant to the Order (including in the execution of any authorised development as is referred to in this Part of this Schedule) including without limitation—
(a)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any assessment of Uniper’s apparatus under Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996 and Gas Safety (Management) Regulations 1996 reasonably necessary as a consequence of the authorised development;
(b)
implementing any mitigation measures required as a result of any assessment referred to in sub-paragraph (a) reasonably necessary as a consequence of the authorised development;
(c)
the approval of plans;
(d)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works; and
(e)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) For the purposes of calculating the sums payable pursuant to sub-paragraph (1) above, in the case of the replacement or removal of apparatus, the following applies—
(a)
where apparatus is removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which will not re-used as part of the apparatus or alternative apparatus, there will be excluded from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of the apparatus being removed; and
(b)
subject to sub-paragraph 225(3)(a), when replacing existing apparatus, there will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of that apparatus being removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the apparatus or alternative apparatus, except that the value of any apparatus or alternative apparatus used to replace the apparatus being removed will be included in the sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), such value being agreed between the parties (or as determined in accordance with paragraph 232 (arbitration) prior to any removal or replacement of the apparatus, provided that, in each case, all charges, costs and expenses reasonably incurred, or reasonably anticipated to be incurred, by Uniper in, or in connection with the works required for the removal or replacement of such apparatus will be included in the sum payable under sub-paragraph (1).
(3) If, in accordance with sub-paragraph 226(2) of this Part of this Schedule, any existing apparatus is replaced with enhanced apparatus where the undertaker’s consent has not been obtained by Uniper (or where disputed in accordance with paragraph 232 (Arbitration), decided not to be necessary), then, if the construction expenses for this replacement surpass the construction expenses that would have been paid for similar or equivalent apparatus then any excess costs will be borne by Uniper, except that where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain similar or equivalent apparatus, full costs will be payable by the undertaker.
(4) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Uniper in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Uniper any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
227.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the authorised development or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by them) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any loss or damage is caused to any apparatus, alternative apparatus or property of Uniper, or there is any interruption in any services provided, or in the supply of any goods, or in the use of the apparatus or alternative apparatus (as applicable) by Uniper, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the costs reasonably and properly incurred by Uniper in making good such loss or damage or in restoring the supply or its use;
(b)
make compensation to Uniper for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by Uniper, by reason or in consequence of any such loss, damage or interruption; and
(c)
indemnify Uniper for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Uniper, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Uniper becoming liable to any third party (an “Indemnity Claim”).
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Uniper or its representatives; or
(b)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working or business interruption) arising from any such damage or interruption which is not reasonably foreseeable.
(3) Uniper must give the undertaker reasonable notice of an Indemnity Claim and no settlement or compromise is to be made that is prejudicial to the undertaker without the consent of the undertaker (not to be unreasonably withheld) which, if it withholds such consent, it will assume the sole conduct of the Indemnity Claim, provided that if the undertaker does not assume the sole conduct of the Indemnity Claim within 30 days of the Indemnified Claim being notified to it, Uniper, or a person designated by Uniper, may conduct the Indemnity Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate and the undertaker will indemnify Uniper for any costs and expenses incurred in connection with defending any such Indemnity Claim.
(4) The undertaker will give assistance to Uniper, as requested, in connection with an Indemnity Claim (including circumstances where Uniper reasonably believes may give rise to an action, claim or demand by a third party).
(5) The undertaker undertakes not to commence construction (and not to permit the commencement of such construction) of the authorised development on any land owned by Uniper or in respect of which Uniper has an easement, wayleave or lease for its apparatus or any other interest or to carry out any works within 15 metres of Uniper’s apparatus (except in respect of any high pressure pipelines) or within 50 metres of Uniper’s high pressure pipelines until the following conditions are satisfied—
(a)
unless and until Uniper is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has first provided the acceptable security (and provided evidence that it will maintain such acceptable security for the construction period of the authorised development from the proposed date of commencement of construction the authorised development) and Uniper has confirmed the same to the undertaker in writing; and
(b)
unless and until Uniper is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to Uniper that it will maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised development from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised development) and Uniper has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker.
(6) The undertaker agrees that if, at any time, the acceptable security or acceptable insurance expires or terminates, ceases to fulfil the criteria of acceptable security or acceptable insurance, ceases to be in full force and effect or becomes invalid or unenforceable for the purpose of this Part of this Schedule or an insolvency-related event occurs in respect of the undertaker, then the relevant security or insurance will no longer constitute acceptable security or acceptable insurance and will promptly be replaced by the undertaker with alternative acceptable security or acceptable insurance as approved by the undertaker, to the extent any acceptable insurance and acceptable security is still required under this Part of this Schedule.
(7) In the event that the undertaker fails to comply with sub-paragraph (4) nothing in this Part of this Schedule will prevent Uniper from seeking injunctive relief (or any other equitable remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(8) Uniper must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within Uniper’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of Uniper’s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker Uniper must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
Co-operation
228.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, Uniper makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraphs 224(5) or 224(7), the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe, efficient and economic operation of Uniper’s apparatus and Uniper must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever Uniper’s consent, agreement or approval to is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by Uniper or the taking of action by Uniper, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
229.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 223(1) of this Part or otherwise as granted by this Order the access to any apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Uniper (or representative) in respect of the apparatus) is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable Uniper (or its representative) to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction. For the avoidance of doubt, Uniper (or its representative) will be entitled to access its apparatus in the land at all times.
Confidentiality
230.—(1) Each party must treat any confidential information as private and confidential. The party in receipt of any confidential information from the other party may not use it for a purpose other than for the performance of its obligations under this Part of this Schedule and must not disclose confidential information received from the other party to any person, provided that a party may disclose confidential information to any of its directors, other officers, employees, contractors, customers, affiliates, insurers, funders, advisers or consultants to the extent that disclosure is reasonably necessary for the purposes of this Part of this Schedule.
(2) Sub-paragraph 231(1) does not apply to Confidential Information—
(a)
which is at the date of commencement, or at any time after that date becomes, publicly known other than by breach of sub-paragraph 13(1);

(c)
to the extent disclosure of the confidential information is required by laws, the instructions of a competent governmental authority or such competent authority acting on behalf of such governmental authority, or the rules of a relevant and recognised stock exchange.

SCHEDULE 15
PROCEDURE FOR DISCHARGE OF REQUIREMENTS
Interpretation
1.  In this Schedule—
“requirement consultee” means any body or authority named in a requirement as a body to be consulted by the relevant planning authority in discharging that requirement;
“start date” means the date of the notification given by the Secretary of State under paragraph 4(2)(c); and
“working day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or English bank or public holiday.
Applications made under requirement
2.—(1) Where an application has been made to the relevant planning authority for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement, the undertaker must also submit a copy of that application to any requirement consultee.
(2) Where an application has been made to the relevant planning authority for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement the relevant planning authority must give notice to the undertaker of its decision on the application within a period of ten weeks beginning with the later of—
(a)
the day immediately following that on which the application is received by the authority;
(b)
the day immediately following that on which further information has been supplied by the undertaker under paragraph 3; or
(c)
such longer period that is agreed in writing by the undertaker and the relevant planning authority.
(3) Subject to paragraph 4, in the event that the relevant planning authority does not determine an application within the period set out in sub-paragraph (2), the relevant planning authority is to be taken to have granted all parts of the application (without any condition or qualification) at the end of that period.
(4) Any application made to the relevant planning authority pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) must include a statement to confirm whether it is likely that the subject matter of the application will give rise to any materially new or materially different environmental effects compared to those in the environmental statement and if it will then it must be accompanied by information setting out what those effects are.
(5) Where an application has been made to the relevant planning authority for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order and the relevant planning authority does not determine the application within the period set out in sub-paragraph (2) and is accompanied by a report pursuant to sub-paragraph (4) which states that the subject matter of such application is likely to give rise to any materially new or materially different environmental effects compared to those in the environmental statement then the application is to be taken to have been refused by the relevant planning authority at the end of that period.
Further information and consultation
3.—(1) In relation to any application to which this Schedule applies, the relevant planning authority may request such reasonable further information from the undertaker as is necessary to enable it to consider the application.
(2) In the event that the relevant planning authority considers such further information to be necessary and the provision governing or requiring the application does not specify that consultation with a requirement consultee is required, the relevant planning authority must, within 20 working days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing specifying the further information required.
(3) If the provision governing or requiring the application specifies that consultation with a requirement consultee is required, the relevant planning authority must issue the consultation to the requirement consultee within 10 working days of receipt of the application, and must notify the undertaker in writing specifying any further information the relevant planning authority considers necessary or that is requested by the requirement consultee within 10 working days of receipt of such a request and in any event within 20 working days of receipt of the application (or such other period as is agreed in writing between the undertaker and the relevant planning authority).
(4) In the event that the relevant planning authority does not give notification as specified in sub-paragraph (2) or (3) it is deemed to have sufficient information to consider the application and is not thereafter entitled to request further information without the prior agreement of the undertaker.
(5) Where further information is requested under this paragraph in relation to part only of an application, that part is to be treated as separate from the remainder of the application for the purposes of calculating time periods in paragraph 2 and paragraph 3.
Appeals
4.—(1) The undertaker may appeal in the event that—
(a)
the relevant planning authority refuses an application for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order or grants it subject to conditions;
(b)
the relevant planning authority is deemed to have refused an application pursuant to paragraph 2(5);
(c)
on receipt of a request for further information pursuant to paragraph 3 the undertaker considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the relevant planning authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or
(d)
on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant planning authority notifies the undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the application.
(2) The steps to be followed in the appeal process are as follows—
(a)
any appeal by the undertaker must be made within 42 days of the date of the notice of the decision or determination, or (where no determination has been made) the expiry of the time period set out in paragraph 22(1), giving rise to the appeal referred to in sub-paragraph (1);
(b)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee;
(c)
the Secretary of State must appoint a person to determine the appeal as soon as reasonably practicable and must forthwith notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for the appointed person’s attention should be sent;
(d)
the relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within 10 working days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(e)
the undertaker may make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within 10 working days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph (d);
(f)
the appointed person must make their decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 30 working days of the deadline for the receipt of counter-submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (e); and
(g)
the appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (c) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(3) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable the appointed person to consider the appeal they must, within five working days of the appointed person’s appointment, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required.
(4) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) must be provided by the relevant party to the appointed person and the other appeal parties on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the appointed person within 10 working days of the specified date, but otherwise the process and time limits set out in sub-paragraphs (d) to (f) of sub-paragraph (2) apply.
(5) The appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal; or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant planning authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not),
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to them in the first instance.
(6) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits and in the sole discretion of the appointed person such written representations as have been sent outside of the relevant time limits.
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears to them that there is sufficient material to enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case.
(8) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, unless proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(9) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is to be deemed to be an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 (requirements) as if it had been given by the relevant planning authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.
(10) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (11) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(11) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to advice on planning appeals and award costs published in Planning Practice Guidance: Appeals (March 2014) or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.
Fees
5.—(1) Where an application is made to the relevant planning authority for written consent, agreement or approval in respect of a requirement, the fee prescribed under regulation 16(1)(b) of the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012(1) (as may be amended or replaced from time to time) is to apply for the discharge of each requirement (whether dealt with in separate applications or combined within a single application) and must be paid to the relevant planning authority for each application.
(2) Any fee paid under this Schedule must be refunded to the undertaker within four weeks of—
(a)
the application being rejected as invalidly made; or
(b)
the relevant planning authority failing to determine the application within the relevant period in paragraph 2(2) or paragraph 2(3) unless—
(i)
within that period the undertaker agrees, in writing, that the fee is to be retained by the relevant planning authority and credited in respect of a future application; or
(ii)
a longer period of time for determining the application has been agreed pursuant to paragraph 2(2) or 2(3) of this Schedule, as applicable.

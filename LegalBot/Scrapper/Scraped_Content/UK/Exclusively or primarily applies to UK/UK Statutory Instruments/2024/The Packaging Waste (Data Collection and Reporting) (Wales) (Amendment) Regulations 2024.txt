20 March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Packaging Waste (Data Collection and Reporting) (Wales) Regulations 2023 (“the principal Regulations”). The purpose of these Regulations is to clarify the division of responsibilities between brand owners, packers/fillers, importers and first UK owners and distributors, and to place a requirement upon Natural Resources Wales (“NRW”) to produce guidance in respect of household packaging and to publish a list of large producers. These Regulations also provide a number of miscellaneous amendments including clarification of sentences and amendment of typographical errors.
Regulation 2 provides a definition of “the principal Regulations” for the purposes of these Regulations.
Regulation 3 is a transitional provision to address the situation where, as a result of amendments made by these Regulations to the principal Regulations, a large producer may not have sufficient data to report on the period from 1 January 2024 to 1 April 2024.
Regulation 5 amends regulation 2 (interpretation) of the principal Regulations by removing the definition of “disposal”, amending the definition of “importer”, and including new definitions for “drink container”, “first UK owner” and “group of companies”.
Regulation 6 makes a minor amendment to regulation 5 (drink) of the principal Regulations.
Regulation 7 makes amendments to regulation 6 (packaging and packaging categories) of the principal Regulations, including inserting a new paragraph (7).
Regulation 8 substitutes a new regulation 7 (household packaging) in the principal Regulations.
Regulation 9 inserts a new regulation 7A (NRW guidance) into the principal Regulations which requires NRW to provide guidance for the purposes of regulation 7 (household packaging) of the principal Regulations.
Regulation 10 amends the definition of “producer” in regulation 8 (producers) of the principal Regulations to extend the meaning of producer to a person who is established in the United Kingdom. It also introduces the concept of a “first UK owner” and makes amendments in respect of brand owners and filled packaging, which is linked to the meaning of producer for the purposes of the principal Regulations.
Regulation 11 amends regulation 10 (supply) of the principal Regulations to substitute wording in relation to the supply of packaging by a first UK owner and an importer.
Regulation 12 makes a minor amendment to regulation 11 (threshold criteria for large and small producers) in the principal Regulations.
Regulation 13 amends regulation 12 (exempt packaging) of the principal Regulations in relation to certain deposit return schemes.
Regulation 14 makes a consequential amendment to regulation 15 (producer obligations) of the principal Regulations following the substitution of new paragraphs (1) and (1A) in regulation 8 of the principal Regulations.
Regulations 15 and 16 make minor amendments to regulation 16 (data collection obligations) and regulation 17 (data reporting obligations) respectively of the principal Regulations.
Regulation 17 inserts a new regulation 17A (recycling data) into the principal Regulations. This new regulation introduces the concept of a “regulation 17A report” and provides that large producers who meet certain criteria have the choice of submitting either a “regulation 17” or “regulation 17A” report in order to discharge their data reporting obligations.
Regulation 18 makes a minor amendment to regulation 20 (schemes: general provisions) of the principal Regulations.
Regulation 19 inserts a new regulation 22A (publication of list of large producers) into the principal Regulations. This places a duty on NRW to publish a list of all large producers who have reported information under regulation 17 (data reporting obligations).
Regulations 20 and 21 make minor amendments to Schedules 1 and 2 to the principal Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

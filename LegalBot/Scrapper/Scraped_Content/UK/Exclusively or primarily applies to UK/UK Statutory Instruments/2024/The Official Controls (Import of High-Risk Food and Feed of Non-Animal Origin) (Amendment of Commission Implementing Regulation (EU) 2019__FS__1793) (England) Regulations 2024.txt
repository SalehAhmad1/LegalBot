The analytical report referred to in Article 10(3) of this Regulation must be issued by a laboratory accredited for the analysis of PCP in food and feed in accordance with BS EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 “General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories” (published by the British Standards Institution on 30th June 2018 (ISBN 978 0 539 01414 3), and available from the British Standards Institution at https://knowledge.bsigroup.com). The analytical report must indicate: (a) the results of sampling and analysis for the presence of PCP, performed by the competent authorities of the country of origin or of the country where the consignment is consigned from if that country is different from the country of origin; (b) the measurement uncertainty of the analytical result; (c) the limit of detection (LOD) of the analytical method; (d) the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the analytical method. The extraction before analysis must be performed with an acidified solvent. The analysis must be carried out according to the modified version of the QuEChERS method or according to an equally reliable method.

Residues of at least those pesticides listed in the control programme adopted in accordance with Article 29(2) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin that can be analysed with multi-residue methods based on GC-MS and LC-MS (pesticides to be monitored in/on products of plant origin only).
(6)
Residues of Carbofuran.
(7)
Residues of Ethylene Oxide (sum of ethylene oxide and 2-chloro-ethanol, expressed as ethylene oxide).

Method validation - Protocol for the validation of alternative (proprietary) methods against a reference method”. BS EN ISO 16140-2:2016 was published by the British Standards Institution on 31st July 2016 (ISBN 978 0 580 69940 5) and is available from the British Standards Institution https://knowledge.bsigroup.com.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1793 on the temporary increase of official controls and emergency measures governing the entry into the Union of certain goods from certain third countries implementing Regulations (EU) 2017/625 and (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Commission Regulations (EC) No 669/2009, (EU) No 884/2014, (EU) 2015/175, (EU) 2017/186 and (EU) 2018/1660, in relation to England.
Regulation 2(2), (3), (6) and Schedule 3 make provisions in relation to the sampling and analyses of food and feed of non-animal origin for the hazard Listeria. Schedule 3 sets out a new Annex outlining the sampling procedure and analytical reference method for the control of the presence of Listeria in food.
Regulation 2(4) substitutes Annex I with Schedule 1, which contains the list of food and feed of non-animal origin from certain third countries, which is subject to a temporary increase in official controls at border control posts in Great Britain.
Regulation 2(5) substitutes Table 1 in Annex II, with Schedule 2. This substitutes the respective table containing the lists of food and feed of non-animal origin from certain third countries subject to special conditions for entry into Great Britain due to contamination risks from the specified hazards.
Regulation 3 makes consequential amendments to the Official Controls (Imports of High Risk Food and Feed of Non-Animal Origin) (Amendment of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1793) (England) Regulations 2022.
In each Schedule, standards are specified within some footnotes to show requirements for the analytical methods and laboratories used. The documents referred to have been published online and the online addresses are specified under each footnote where relevant. Hard copies of these documents are available for inspection at the Food Standards Agency, Floors 6 and 7, Clive House, 70 Petty France, London SW1H 9EX, at reasonable times, following a written request to that address or to imported.food@food.gov.uk.

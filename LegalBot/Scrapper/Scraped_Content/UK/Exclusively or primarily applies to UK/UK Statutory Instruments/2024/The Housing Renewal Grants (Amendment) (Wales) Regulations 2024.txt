12 June 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Housing Renewal Grants Regulations 1996 (“the 1996 Regulations”), which set out the means test for determining the amount of grant which may be paid by local housing authorities under Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996.
The Tertiary Education and Research (Wales) Act 2022 (“the 2022 Act”) establishes the Commission for Tertiary Education and Research (“the Commission”) and provides a new statutory framework for publicly funded tertiary education and research in Wales. These Regulations amend the 1996 Regulations to update references to legislation which is repealed by the 2022 Act and replace references to the National Assembly for Wales with a reference to the Welsh Ministers or the Commission, as appropriate.
These Regulations also amend the 1996 Regulations to correct out of date references to student support legislation.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

“migration day” in relation to a claimant means the day before the day specified in paragraph (1) of article 3B (saving to cease following issue of tax credit closure notice) of the No. 32 Order;
“the No. 32 Order” means the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (Commencement No. 32 and Savings and Transitional Provisions) Order 2019;
“tax credit”, “child tax credit” and “working tax credit” have the same meaning as in the Tax Credits Act 2002(3).
Claimants eligible for protection
2.—(1) This Schedule applies where the claimant has been issued with a tax credit closure notice and—
(a)
the claimant was entitled to an award of child tax credit on the migration day; and
(b)
either—
(i)
the claimant was entitled to an award of state pension credit when the tax credit closure notice was issued; or
(ii)
the claimant made a claim for state pension credit on or after the issue of the tax credit closure notice and before the expiry of one month beginning with the deadline day specified in that notice.
(2) This Schedule does not apply where—
(a)
the claimant was a member of a couple for the purposes of the child tax credit award when the tax credit closure notice was issued but is a single person or a member of a different couple for the purposes of state pension credit on the migration day; or
(b)
the claimant was a single person for the purposes of the child tax credit award when the tax credit closure notice was issued but is a member of a couple for the purposes of state pension credit on the migration day.
Transitional additional amount
3.  An additional amount of the appropriate minimum guarantee (“the transitional additional amount”) applies in accordance with regulation 6(6)(e) if the weekly amount determined in accordance with paragraph 4 (representative weekly amount of child tax credit), combined with the weekly amount of state pension credit (if any) to which the claimant was entitled on the migration day, is greater than the weekly amount determined in accordance with paragraph 5 (indicative SPC amount).
Representative weekly amount of child tax credit
4.—(1) To calculate the representative weekly amount of an award of child tax credit—
(a)
take the figure for the daily rate of the award on the migration day provided by HMRC and calculated on the basis of the information as to the claimant’s circumstances held by HMRC on that day; and
(b)
convert to a weekly figure by multiplying by 7.
(2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(a) “the daily rate” is—
(a)
in a case where section 13(1) of the Tax Credit Act 2002 (relevant income does not exceed the income threshold or the claimant is entitled to a prescribed social security benefit) applies, the maximum rate of each element to which the claimant is entitled on the migration day divided by 365; and
(b)
in any other case, the rate that would be produced by applying regulations 6 to 9 of the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and Determination of Rates) Regulations 2002(4) as if the migration day were a relevant period of one day.
Indicative SPC amount
5.—(1) The indicative SPC amount is the weekly amount to which a claimant would be entitled if an award of state pension credit were calculated in accordance with the Act and these Regulations by reference to the claimant’s circumstances on the migration day—
(a)
disregarding any amount of working tax credit to which the person may be entitled on that day;
(b)
including an additional amount in accordance with Schedule IIA (additional amount applicable for claimants responsible for a child or qualifying young person); and
(c)
applying the assumptions in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) The assumptions are—
(a)
the claimant is responsible for any child or qualifying young person in respect of whom the individual element of child tax credit is payable;
(b)
the amount of the claimant’s earned income is the annual amount of any employment income or trading income, as defined by regulation 4 or 6 respectively of the Tax Credits (Definition and Calculation of Income) Regulations 2002(5), by reference to which the representative weekly rate of that tax credit is calculated for the purposes of paragraph 4(1) converted to a net weekly amount by—
(i)
dividing by 52; and
(ii)
deducting such amount for income tax and national insurance contributions as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.
(3) If the claimant would not satisfy the condition in section 2(1) (guarantee credit) of the Act because the claimant has income which exceeds the appropriate minimum guarantee, the claimant is to be treated for the purposes of calculating the indicative SPC amount as if they were entitled to a guarantee credit of a nil amount.
Initial calculation of the transitional additional amount
6.  The initial amount of the transitional additional amount is—
(a)
if the amount of the guarantee credit in the indicative SPC amount is greater than nil, the amount by which the representative weekly amount of child tax credit combined with the weekly amount of state pension credit (if any) to which the claimant was entitled on the migration day, exceeds the weekly amount of the indicative SPC amount;
(b)
if the amount of the guarantee credit in the indicative SPC amount is nil—
(i)
the sum of the representative weekly amount of child tax credit and the amount, if any, by which the income deducted in the calculation of the indicative SPC amount exceeds the amount of the appropriate minimum guarantee; minus
(ii)
the amount of the maximum saving credit, but only if the indicative SPC amount includes a savings credit or would do but for the claimant’s income being such that the condition in section 3(2)(b) of the Act is not met.
Reduction of the transitional additional amount
7.—(1) Whenever there is a relevant increase after the first day on which the transitional additional amount applies, the transitional additional amount is to be reduced by an amount equal to that increase.
(2) A relevant increase is an increase in the standard minimum guarantee or in any additional amount prescribed under section 2(3) of the Act, including where that additional amount is applied for the first time or reapplied following a change of circumstances.
Circumstances in which the transitional additional amount ceases
8.—(1) A transitional additional amount is no longer applicable if—
(a)
the transitional additional amount is reduced to nil in accordance with paragraph 7;
(b)
the claimant was a member of a couple and ceases to be a member of that couple or becomes a member of a different couple;
(c)
the claimant was single and becomes a member of a couple; or
(d)
the claimant is no longer responsible for any child or qualifying young person for whom they were responsible at the time the tax credit closure notice was issued.
(2) Where the claimant ceases to be entitled to state pension credit, the transitional additional amount is not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), to apply to a subsequent award to the claimant or, if the claimant is a member of a couple, their partner.
(3) Where an award (“the subsequent award”) is made to a person who moves from Northern Ireland when they are entitled to an award of state pension credit that includes a transitional additional amount then, provided their circumstances are otherwise unchanged, the subsequent award is to include a transitional additional amount calculated as if the subsequent award were a continuation of the award made in Northern Ireland.
Effect of revision, appeal etc. of an award of a tax credit
9.—(1) Nothing in paragraph 4 or 5 requiring a calculation in relation to the transitional additional amount to be made on the basis of information held by HMRC on the migration day prevents the Secretary of State from revising or superseding a decision in relation to a claim for, or an award of, state pension credit where—
(a)
in the opinion of the Secretary of State, the information held on that day was inaccurate or incomplete in some material respect because of—
(i)
a misrepresentation by a claimant;
(ii)
a failure to report information that a claimant was required to report where that failure was advantageous to the claimant; or
(iii)
an official error; or
(b)
a decision has been made on or after the migration day on—
(i)
an application made before the migration day to revise a decision in relation to an award of a tax credit (including the report of a change of circumstances); or
(ii)
an appeal in relation to such an application.
(2) In this paragraph “official error” means an error that—
(a)
was made by an officer of, or an employee of a body acting on behalf of, the Department for Work and Pensions or HMRC; and
(b)
was not caused, or materially contributed to, by any person outside that body or outside the Department or HMRC,
but excludes any error of law which is shown to have been such by a subsequent decision of the Upper Tribunal or of a court as defined in section 27(7) of the Social Security Act 1998(6).”.

7th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in relation to the abolition of tax credits for certain claimants who have reached the qualifying age for state pension credit (“the qualifying age”). They provide for claimants who are entitled to working tax credit to move to universal credit with transitional protection and for claimants who are entitled to child tax credit to move to pension credit with transitional protection. They also make provision consequential on these changes.
Regulation 2 amends the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1230).
Regulation 2(3) allows a migration notice to be issued with a deadline of less than 3 months where a previous notice has been cancelled. It also allows a migration notice issued in error to be treated as a tax credit closure notice (see regulation 3).
Regulation 2(4) provides for transitional protection to cease after an initial period of 12 months in the case of single claimants or couples who have reached the qualifying age and whose earnings have fallen below a threshold for three consecutive months.
Regulation 2(5) inserts a new regulation 60A providing for the waiver of the upper age limit in universal credit in the case of a single person or couples who have reached the qualifying age, are entitled to working tax credit, and have been issued with a migration notice. The waiver ends (thereby ending entitlement to universal credit) if the person claims state pension credit or in any of the circumstances in which transitional protection would cease under regulation 56.
Regulation 2(5) also inserts a new regulation 60B which provides an exemption from the notional income rule (treating a person as having income they have not applied for) for persons who have deferred their state or non-state pension. It also inserts a new regulation 60C exempting persons over the qualifying age from the universal credit benefit cap.
Regulation 3, which extends to Great Britain and Northern Ireland, amends the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (Commencement No. 32 and Savings and Transitional Provisions) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/167 (C. 6) (“the No. 32 Order”).
Article 2 of the No. 32 Order commenced section 33(1)(f) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 abolishing tax credits, subject to a saving provision in article 3 which allowed existing awards to continue and to be renewed annually.
New article 3A provides for the Secretary of State (or in Northern Ireland, the Department for Communities) to issue a notice (“tax credit closure notice”) to certain claimants who are already entitled to state pension credit or who are entitled to child tax credit but not working tax credit. The latter group includes certain claimants who are protected from the exclusion of mixed-age couples from entitlement to state pension credit.
Article 3A requires the tax credit closure notice to inform the claimant that their award will end by a specified day (“the deadline day”). It also contains provision for the deadline day to be extended and for the tax credit closure notice to be cancelled in certain circumstances. If the notice is issued in error it may be treated as if it were a migration notice under the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2014 or the corresponding provisions for Northern Ireland.
New article 3B provides for the ending of the tax credit award following the issue of a tax credit closure notice. The award is ended by the cessation of the saving provision in article 3 of the No. 32 Order. This has the effect of bringing the provision in section 33(1)(f) fully into effect for that case.
New article 3B also provides for the tax credit award to be finalised after it has been ended by a tax credit closure notice by applying the same modifications of tax credit legislation as apply to awards terminated by a claim for universal credit.
Regulation 4 contains amendments to the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/1792) which provide for transitional protection in state pension credit for persons issued with a tax credit closure notice.
Regulation 4(4) amends regulation 18 of those Regulations to provide a 52 week exemption from the notional income rule for persons who have deferred their state or non-state pension.
Regulation 4(5) inserts a new Schedule IIB which provides for a new transitional additional amount to be included in the guarantee element of a state pension credit award where a person entitled to child tax credit is issued with a tax credit closure notice and is either already entitled to state pension credit or claims before the final deadline. It provides for the calculation of the amount and the circumstances in which it reduces or ceases.
Regulation 5 makes provision in relation to the time for claiming state pension credit where a person is issued with a tax credit closure notice. Where the claim is made on or before the deadline day the state pension credit award starts on the day of the claim and the tax credit award ends on the day before. When a claim is made within 3 months of the deadline day the award may be backdated so it begins on that day.
Regulation 6 makes changes to the Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/214) so the applicable amount no longer includes a maximum of two amounts for any children or young persons for whom the claimant is responsible or the claimant’s partner is responsible and who are members of the same household.
Regulation 7 amends the Social Security (Widow's Benefit and Retirement Pensions) Regulations 1979 (S.I. 1979/642) (the “1979 Regulations”) and the Social Security (Deferral of Retirement Pensions) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/453) (the “2005 Regulations”).
If a person defers entitlement to a state pension, that person may become entitled to a higher rate of state pension or, if they reached state pension age before 6th April 2016, a lump sum payment (“deferral benefits”), which accrue over time while the benefit remains unclaimed, provided the person is not receiving certain Social Security benefits while deferring. These Regulations amend regulation 4 of the 1979 Regulations and regulation 3 of the 2005 Regulations to provide that a single person does not accrue any deferral benefits while that person is in receipt of universal credit. This brings the provisions concerning when deferral benefits may be accrued by a single person into line with those already applicable to couples.

26th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order appoints 28th March 2024 as the day for the coming into effect of the Pensions Regulator General Code of Practice. The General Code of Practice consolidates ten existing codes of practice and provides guidance to those running occupational, personal, and public service pension schemes.
The General Code of Practice is available on the Pensions Regulator’s website: https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/document-library. Copies may be obtained by post from the Pensions Regulator, Telecom House, 125-135 Preston Road, Brighton, BN1 6AF.
Article 3 of this Order amends article 2 of the Pensions Act 2004 (Commencement No. 4 and Amendment) Order 2005 (S.I. 2005/1108) by omitting paragraph (1) of that article, which brought into effect the Pensions Regulator Code of Practice No. 1: Reporting breaches of the Law. That Code of Practice is revoked with effect from 28th March 2024, under the Pensions Act 2004 (Codes of Practice) (Revocation) Order 2024 (S.I. 2024/273) (“the 2024 Revocation Order”).
Article 4 revokes the seven Appointed Day Orders which brought into effect a number of other codes of practice issued by the Pensions Regulator, which have also been revoked by the 2024 Revocation Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 3 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”) makes provision in relation to arrangements for school admissions.
In particular, section 89B of Part 3 of the 1998 Act enables the Welsh Ministers to make regulations requiring a local authority in Wales to formulate a qualifying scheme for co-ordinating the arrangements for the admission of pupils to community, voluntary controlled, voluntary aided and foundation schools in its area. These Regulations make provision in relation to such a qualifying scheme.
These Regulations do not apply to maintained nursery schools or maintained special schools. These Regulations also do not apply to the admission arrangements for pupils who have ceased to be of compulsory school age or for the purpose of receiving sixth form education (see section 89B(7) of the 1998 Act).
These Regulations require each local authority in Wales to formulate a qualifying scheme for maintained schools in their area. That qualifying scheme must comply with the requirements for such schemes set out in the Schedule to these Regulations (regulation 3).
The first qualifying scheme must be formulated and adopted by 1 January 2025 (“the first qualifying scheme”) and by 1 January for all subsequent years (regulation 4). The first qualifying scheme will apply to admission arrangements in the academic year 2027 to 2028.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations also makes provision in respect of consultation in relation to, and adoption of, the qualifying scheme. Section 85A of the 1998 Act provides that in carrying out their functions in relation to admission arrangements, admission authorities must have regard to any relevant advice given to them by an admission forum established under that section in respect of those functions.
Each local authority in Wales must inform the Welsh Ministers whether or not it has adopted a qualifying scheme by 28 February in the academic year 2 years before the academic year in which pupils will be admitted under the scheme. This duty applies to local authorities from 28 February 2025 (in respect of admission in the academic year 2027 to 2028) and all subsequent academic years (regulation 5).
Section 89B(2) of the 1998 Act enables the Welsh Ministers to make and impose a scheme for the co-ordination of admission arrangements (“Welsh Minister scheme”). Section 89B(3) of the 1998 Act provides that a Welsh Minister scheme may not be made if the circumstances set out in that subsection are met by a date to be prescribed by the Welsh Ministers. The prescribed date is set out in regulation 5, and is 28 February.
Each local authority in Wales must communicate to parents its determination to offer or to refuse admission of a pupil to a primary or secondary school on the date set out in regulation 6 (regulation 6).
These Regulations apply the powers of intervention in Part 2 of the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013 (intervention in the conduct of maintained schools) to the obligations imposed on governing bodies and local authorities under a qualifying scheme (regulation 7).
These Regulations amend the Education (Admission Appeals Arrangements) (Wales) Regulations 2005 (“the 2005 Regulations”) so as to correct a mistake in regulation 3 and regulation 5 of the 2005 Regulations (regulation 8).
These Regulations insert a new paragraph 5A into Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the School Information (Wales) Regulations 2011 (“the 2011 Regulations”) so as to require that information in relation to a local authority’s qualifying scheme or a Welsh Minister scheme be included in the local authority school prospectus (regulation 9). The new paragraph 5A applies to the admission school year 2026 to 2027 and so the information prescribed by it will be included in the local authority school prospectus for the first time for the admission school year 2026 to 2027 (see regulation 2(1) of the 2011 Regulations for the definition of “admission school year”).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

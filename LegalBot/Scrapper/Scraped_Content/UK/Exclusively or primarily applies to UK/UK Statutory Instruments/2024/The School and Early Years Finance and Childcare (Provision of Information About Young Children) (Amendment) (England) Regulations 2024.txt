(2) A single per pupil amount in relation to each pupil at key stage 1 or 2 whose first language is not English, where the pupil was not recorded as attending a school in England on any school census before 1st October 2021.
(3) A single per pupil amount in relation to each pupil at key stages 3 and 4 whose first language is not English, where the pupil was not recorded as attending a school in England on any school census before 1st October 2021.Mobility factor
19.—(1) In determining budget shares for primary and secondary schools (other than special schools, pupil referral units, and nursery schools), a local authority must ascertain and take into account in its formula the following factors.
(2) Where the total number of pupils to whom paragraph (3) applies is more than 6% of the total number of pupils at key stages 1 and 2 in the school, a single per pupil amount for every pupil in excess of that 6%.
(3) This paragraph applies to pupils at key stages 1 and 2 who—
(a)
joined the school in the previous three school years; and
(b)
were first recorded on the school census in a spring or summer term,
excluding pupils who joined the school in the nursery class (if the school has such a class) and pupils who were first recorded on the school census in a spring term as being in Reception.
(4) Where the total number of pupils to whom paragraph (5) applies is more than 6% of the total number of pupils at key stages 3 and 4 in the school, a single per pupil amount for every pupil in excess of that 6%.
(5) This paragraph applies to pupils at key stages 3 and 4 who joined the school in the previous three school years and were first recorded on the school census in a spring or summer term.The London fringe

21.—(1) In determining budget shares for primary and secondary schools (other than special schools, pupil referral units and nursery schools), a local authority must ascertain and take into account in its formula the following factors.
(2) In respect of all maintained primary schools to which paragraph (3) applies, other than those which are middle schools(1), an amount (“the final value”) calculated in accordance with paragraphs (4) to (6).
(3) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
the mean distance by road between—
(i)
the centroid of the home postcode(2) (“the home postcode”) of each pupil for whom a school falling within paragraph (2) is their closest compatible school (irrespective of whether or not the pupil attends that school); and
(ii)
the second closest compatible school in relation to each of those pupils,
is greater than 80% of a distance determined by the local authority, which must not be less than two miles, and must be the same distance in relation to all maintained primary schools which meet the criteria specified in this paragraph; and
(b)
the mean size of a year group in that school is less than a number determined by the local authority, which must be—
(i)
no more than 21.4; and
(ii)
the same number in relation to all schools which meet the criteria specified in this paragraph.
(4) Where the school meets the criteria specified in paragraph (3)—
(a)
a year group weighting is determined as follows—
(i)
if A is less than 0.5 x B, the value of 1; or
(ii)
if A is equal to or more than 0.5 x B, the value of 1 – ((A – (0.5 x B)) / (0.5 x B)); and
(b)
a distance weighting is determined as follows—
(i)
if D is equal to or greater than C, the value of 1;
(ii)
if D is less than C but greater than 0.8 x C, the value of 1 – (C – D) / (0.2 x C).
(5) The final value is calculated by multiplying the lump-sum funding for sparsity determined by the local authority, the year-group weighting, and the distance weighting.
(6) For the purposes of paragraph (4)—
A is the number which represents the mean size of a year group at the school (derived by dividing the number of pupils by the number of year groups);
B is the number determined by the authority in accordance with paragraph (3)(b);
C is the number determined by the authority in accordance with paragraph (3)(a);
D is the number which represents the “sparsity distance” for the school (calculated by identifying all the pupils for whom the school is their closest compatible school and calculating the mean road distance from the home postcodes of those pupils to their second closest compatible school).
(7) In respect of all maintained middle schools and secondary schools which meet the criteria specified in paragraph (8), the final value is calculated in accordance with paragraphs (10) to (12).
(8) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
the mean distance by road between—
(i)
the home postcodes of all those pupils for whom a school falling within paragraph (7) is their closest compatible school (irrespective of whether or not the pupils attend that school); and
(ii)
the second closest compatible school in relation to each of those pupils,
is greater than 80% of a distance determined by the local authority in accordance with paragraph (9); and
(b)
the mean size of a year group in that school is less than a number determined by the local authority, which—
(i)
must not be less than—
(aa)
69.2 in respect of middle schools other than all-through schools;
(bb)
62.5 in respect of middle schools which are all-through schools; or
(cc)
120 in respect of secondary schools other than middle schools; and
(ii)
must be the same number in relation to all schools of each type mentioned in paragraph (i).
(9) The distance to be determined by the local authority, referred to in paragraph (8)(a)—
(a)
must not be less than—
(i)
two miles in respect of middle schools; and
(ii)
three miles in respect of secondary schools other than middle schools; and
(b)
must be the same distance in relation to all the schools of each type mentioned in sub-paragraph (a)(i) and (ii).
(10) Where a school meets the criteria specified in paragraph (8)—
(a)
a year group weighting is determined as follows—
(i)
if A is less than 0.5 x B, the value of 1;
(ii)
if A is equal to or more than 0.5 x B, the value of 1– ((A – (0.5 x B)) / (0.5 x B)); and
(b)
a distance weighting is determined as follows—
(i)
if D is equal to or greater than C, the value of 1;
(ii)
if D is less than C but greater than 0.8 x C, the value of 1 – (C – D) / (0.2 x C).
(11) The final value is calculated by multiplying the year-group weighting, the distance weighting and the lump-sum funding for sparsity determined by the local authority.
(12) For the purposes of paragraph (10)—
A is the number which represents the mean size of a year group at the school (derived by dividing the number of pupils by the number of year groups);
B is the number determined by the authority in accordance with paragraph (8)(b);
C is the number determined by the authority in accordance with paragraph (8)(a);
D is the number which represents the “sparsity distance” for the school, calculated by identifying all the pupils for whom the school is their closest compatible school and calculating the mean road distance from the home postcode of each of those pupils to that pupil’s second closest compatible school.
(13) Where determining the year group weighting in accordance with paragraph (4)(a) or (10)(a) or the distance weighting in accordance with paragraph (4)(b) or (10)(b) would produce a result which, in the opinion of a local authority, is unfair or disproportionate, the authority may instead use either of the criteria specified in paragraph (14) (“the alternative criteria”) if—
(a)
the use of the alternative criteria is authorised by the local authority’s schools forum under regulation 12(1)(f) or the Secretary of State under regulation 12(3); and
(b)
the local authority uses the same criteria to calculate the year group weighting or the distance weighting for all schools which meet the criteria specified in paragraph (3), or as the case may be, paragraph (8).
(14) The alternative criteria which may be used instead of those specified in paragraph (4) or (10) are—
(a)
that the year-group weighting is given either—
(i)
as a value of 1; or
(ii)
as a value of the amount (1 – A/B);
(b)
that the distance weighting is given as a value of 1.
(15) In this regulation—

in the case of a pupil referral unit, the local authority has entered into a risk protection arrangement with the Secretary of State which is still in force, or enters into such an arrangement which commences on or after 1st April 2024.
(3) In paragraph (2)(a) and (b), Z is the number of days that the school or pupil referral unit is subject to a risk protection arrangement with the Secretary of State, beginning with 1st April 2024, or on the day on which that arrangement commences, if later, and ending with 31st March 2025.Split sites factor
23.—(1) In determining budget shares for primary and secondary schools (other than special schools, pupil referral units and nursery schools), a local authority must determine additional funding for each school with a split site by calculating, for each of the school’s eligible sites other than the main site—
(a)
a basic eligibility factor; and
(b)
a distance funding factor,
and adding the two factors together.
(2) The basic eligibility factor referred to in paragraph (1)(a) is a single per site sum determined by the local authority and applied to each of the school’s eligible sites up to a maximum of three sites.
(3) The basic eligibility factor determined under paragraph (2) must be no more than 2.5% above or below the amount which would be produced by multiplying the basic eligibility factor set under the national funding formula(1) (which for the financial year beginning with 1st April 2024 is £53,700) by the ACA applying in relation to the local authority in question, except where the authority is a fringe authority, in which case the ACA used as the multiplier is the lowest ACA applying in relation to that authority.
(4) The distance funding factor referred to in paragraph (1)(b) must be calculated for each eligible site which is more than 100 metres by road from the main site, up to a maximum of three sites, according to the formula A x B where—
(a)
A is the distance weighting for each eligible site—
(i)
where a site is 500 metres or more by road from the main site, A = 1; and
(ii)
where a site is less than 500 metres by road from the main site, A is calculated according to the formula 1- ((500 - C) divided by 400) where C is the distance by road in metres from the main site; and
(b)
B is a single per site amount determined by the local authority.
(5) The amount determined under paragraph (4)(b) must be no more than 2.5% above or below the amount which would be produced by multiplying the distance funding factor set under the national funding formula(2) (which for the financial year beginning with 1st April 2024 is £26,900) by the ACA applying in relation to that local authority, except where the authority is a fringe authority, in which case the ACA used as the multiplier is the lowest ACA applying in relation to that authority.
(6) Where a school has more than three split sites, the calculation of the distance funding factor in respect of each site must be based on the distance from the main site of each of the three sites which are furthest from the main site.
(7) For the purposes of this regulation—
(a)
a school has an eligible split site if it has at least one site other than the main site which—
(i)
shares the same unique reference number(3) with the school’s main site;
(ii)
is separated from the school’s main site by a road or railway and can only be accessed by crossing or walking alongside the road or railway;
(iii)
has a building on it which is owned, controlled or maintained by the school and is primarily used for the education of 5- to 16-year-old pupils; and
(b)
“road” means a road to which the public have 24-hour access.

(a)
in the case where the local authority decides to fund only funded early years provision, take into account—
(i)
the predicted total number of hours of attendance of pupils in the nursery school or nursery class, and of children being provided with community early years provision, who will receive funded early years provision during the period (basing the calculation on the actual hours of such attendance in each of at least three sample weeks); or
(ii)
the actual total number of hours of such attendance for the period; or

40.—(1) A local authority may at any time during the funding period redetermine a maintained school’s budget share, or the amount allocated to a relevant early years provider, for the funding period or any previous funding period in order to correct an error in a determination or redetermination made under these Regulations or any previous regulations made under section 47 or 47ZA of the 1998 Act (“preceding regulations”), whether arising from a mistake as to the number of pupils at the school or otherwise, and any such redetermination will take effect in the next financial year following the funding period.
(2) In so far as any redetermination under paragraph (1) would require the amount that would otherwise have been the budget share of a school to be reduced, it may not be reduced to a figure which is lower than that which could have been allocated to that school under these Regulations or under the preceding regulations in force during the funding period in which the error occurred.
(3) A local authority may redetermine a school’s budget share to take into account any changes in that school’s non-domestic rate liability in relation to the funding period or any previous funding period.Alternative arrangements approved by the Secretary of State

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for local authorities’ financial arrangements in relation to the funding of maintained schools and providers of funded early years provision in England, for the financial year 2024-2025. They also contain minor amendments to the Childcare (Provision of Information About Young Children) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/1554).
The School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/27) are revoked on 1st April 2024. The School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/59) remain in force.
Part 2 defines the non-schools education budget (regulation 4 and Schedule 1), the schools budget (regulation 6 and Schedule 2), central expenditure and the individual schools budget (regulation 8 and Schedule 2). It requires local authorities to determine budget shares for schools maintained by them and amounts to be allocated in respect of early years provision in their areas, in accordance with the appropriate formulae (regulations 10 and 11).
Chapter 1 of Part 2 deals with the determination of budget shares for schools. Regulations 13 and 15 to 23 make provision for specific factors that the local authority must include in their local funding formulae for certain schools. The allowable ranges for these amounts or sums are set in relation to the distance between their respective value in the national funding formula, and for all mandatory factors other than the split site factor, the value in the local authority’s funding formula in the previous funding period (financial year 2023 – 2024). Regulation 24 specifies additional criteria which may, or must, be taken into account in setting budgets for certain schools. The Regulations also impose a minimum per pupil amount (regulation 26) and a minimum funding guarantee for schools (regulation 27 and Schedule 3). Regulations 28 to 30 make provision for calculation of budgets in relation to specific types of school or specific circumstances.
Chapter 2 of Part 3 deals with early years provision and requires local authorities’ formulae to take into account the predicted hours of attendance (with provision for review and redetermination on the basis of information about actual hours of attendance) (regulation 31) and to include one or more social deprivation factors (regulation 32). Regulations 33 and 34 provide for additional amounts to be included in respect of children in specified circumstances (regulation 33) and disabled children (regulation 34). There is a requirement to pass 95% of funding to early years providers (regulation 36) and a 12% limit on the amount of funding that may be attributable to the discretionary (supplementary) part of the early years formulae (regulation 37).
There are also requirements in relation to local authorities’ schemes (regulation 42 and Schedule 4).
Part 5 of these Regulations contains minor amendments to S.I 2009/1554. Paragraphs (1), (2) and 3(c) of regulation 45 make amendments to regulation 2 (interpretation) of, and paragraph 14 of the Schedule to, S.I. 2009/1554, which are consequential to the regulations applying to the 2024-25 financial year in Parts 1 to 4 of, and the Schedules to, these Regulations. Paragraph (3)(a) and (b) of regulation 45 amends the Schedule to S.I. 2009/1554 to simplify the way a “stretched” free entitlements (when a child takes fewer hours a week of free provision over more weeks of the year) is recorded on the Early Years Census and to provide for the phased introduction of the Government’s expansion of free early years entitlements to qualifying children aged 9 months to 2 years of working parents from 1st April 2024.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

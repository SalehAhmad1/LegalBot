The 2013 Regulations apply to England only.
The 2013 Regulations are amended to increase voucher values by approximately 1.68%.
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 20 of the 2013 Regulations to increase the redemption value of a voucher issued for replacement of a single contact lens or repair of a frame.

Regulation 3 is a saving provision which provides that the old values will continue to apply in relation to vouchers accepted or presented before 1st April 2024.

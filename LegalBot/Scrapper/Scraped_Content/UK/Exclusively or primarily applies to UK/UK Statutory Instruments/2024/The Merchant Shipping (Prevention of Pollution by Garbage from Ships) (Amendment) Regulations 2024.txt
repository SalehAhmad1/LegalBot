(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution by Garbage from Ships) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/621) (“the Garbage Regulations”) to implement an amendment to Annex V (prevention of pollution by garbage from ships) to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (“MARPOL”). The amendment was adopted by International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolution MEPC.360(79) on 16th December 2022 and comes into force on 1st May 2024.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 12 of the Garbage Regulations to give effect to the amendment to Annex V of MARPOL. This amendment extends the requirement in regulation 10.3 of Annex V of MARPOL to provide a Garbage Record Book to ships of 100 gross tonnage and above. This requirement previously applied only to ships of 400 gross tonnage and above.
Regulation 3 makes a consequential amendment to the entry for the Garbage Regulations in Schedule 1 to the Merchant Shipping (Fees) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1104).
MARPOL, the Protocol of 1978 modifying MARPOL, the amendments to it including Resolution MEPC.360(79), may be obtained in copy from the IMO, 4 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7SR and are available on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) treaties database (https://treaties.fcdo.gov.uk/responsive/app/consolidatedSearch).

(This note is not part of the Order)

This Order modifies the application of certain provisions in Part 4 of the Extradition Act 2003 (c. 41) which provide that certain powers may be exercised only with the authorisation of a police officer of at least the rank of inspector. It enables a designated NCA officer of at least grade 3 to authorise designated NCA officers when they are exercising their powers under these provisions.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under section 150 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 which, among other things, allows the Secretary of State to make provision in consequence of Acts of Senedd Cymru.
The Tertiary Education and Research (Wales) Act 2022 (“the 2022 Act”) abolishes the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (“HEFCW”) and creates the Commission for Tertiary Education and Research (“the Commission”). This Order makes consequential amendments to reflect the new provisions of the 2022 Act.
Article 2 amends the definition of “special case charity” in regulation 2 of the Charities (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 to replace the reference to HEFCW with a reference to the Commission. Section 1 of the 2022 Act establishes the Commission and section 23 of the 2022 Act provides for the dissolution of HEFCW.
Article 3 amends regulation 3 of the Charities (Exception from Registration) Regulations 2010 to replace the reference to HEFCW with a reference to the Commission.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

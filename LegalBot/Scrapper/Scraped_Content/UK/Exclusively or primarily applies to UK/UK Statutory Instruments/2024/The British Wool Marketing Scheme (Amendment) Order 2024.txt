Coming into force

The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(1), the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs(2) and the Welsh Ministers(3)(4) make this Order with the consent of the Scottish Ministers(5), in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2 of, and the First Schedule to, the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958(6).
In accordance with the above provisions, proposed amendments to the British Wool Marketing Scheme(7) were submitted to the Minister(8) and published in the Gazette(9).
No objections were made, and the Minister is satisfied that the proposed amendments will lead to the more efficient operation of the Scheme(10).
(1)
The functions of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food were transferred to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by article 2(2) and (5) of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/794; to which there are amendments not relevant to this Order). In relation to functions exercisable jointly, note article 1(5) of that Order.
(2)
Under article 3(3) and (4) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Modification of Enactments) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/2843 (N.I.); to which there are amendments not relevant to this Order), the powers being exercised were transferred from the Secretary of State concerned with agriculture in Northern Ireland to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (now the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs by virtue of section 1(2) of the Departments Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 (c.5 (N.I.))).
(3)
Under article 2(4) of, and Schedule 1 to, the Transfer of Functions (Wales) (No. 1) Order 1978 (S.I. 1978/272; to which there are amendments not relevant to this Order), the functions exercisable by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in relation to Wales became exercisable jointly with the Secretary of State. The functions of a Minister of the Crown in relation to agriculture were, so far as exercisable in relation to Wales, transferred to the National Assembly for Wales (now Senedd Cymru by virtue of section 2 of the Senedd and Elections (Wales) Act 2020 (anaw 1)) by section 22 of, and paragraph 1 of Schedule 2 to, the Government of Wales Act 1998 (c. 38) (now repealed) and Article 2(a) of, and Schedule 1 to, the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/672; to which there are amendments not relevant to this Order). Those functions were then transferred from the National Assembly of Wales to the Welsh Ministers by paragraph 30 of Schedule 11 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32).
(4)
Section 52 of, and Part 1 of the Third Schedule to, the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 (c.47 (6 & 7 Eliz 2)) (“the 1958 Act”) provide the definition of “the Minister” for the purpose of the powers being exercised.
(5)
The Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public Authorities) (Specification) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/1319) specified the British Wool Marketing Board as a cross-border public authority for the purposes of the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46). By article 3 of, and paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to, the Scotland Act 1998 (Cross-Border Public Authorities) (Adaptation of Functions etc.) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999/1747, amended by S.I. 2000/1113), the Secretary of State for Scotland ceased to be a Minister of the Crown who may, under the 1958 Act, modify the British Wool Marketing Scheme (Approval) Order 1950 (S.I. 1950/1326, amended by S.I. 2000/1709, 2002/2843, 2008/948; there are other amending instruments but none is relevant) (“the 1950 Order”), and that function became exercisable only with the consent of the Scottish Ministers.

14th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes further amendments to the British Wool Marketing Scheme (Approval) Order 1950 (S.I. 1950/1326) (“the 1950 Order”).
The amendments principally enable decisions and meetings to be held by electronic, digital and virtual forms of communication. They also allow for additional members to be appointed to the Board to expand its expertise, remove the age limit for regional Board members and county representatives to take account of legislation protecting against age discrimination and bring the timetable for producing annual accounts in line with other public bodies.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

16 July 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision about the resolution of disputes in relation to landlord’s consent and variations to the terms of a contract of tenancy of an agricultural holding under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 (c. 5) (“the 1986 Act”) and about applications to succeed to a tenancy of an agricultural holding under the 1986 Act.
Part 1 contains introductory provisions.
Part 2 provides for a tenant to refer a request to arbitration or, by agreement in writing with the landlord, third party determination where a landlord’s consent or a variation of the terms of a contract of tenancy of an agricultural holding under the 1986 Act is required either to enable a tenant to request or apply for relevant financial assistance under the Agriculture (Wales) Act 2023 (asc 4) as defined in regulation 2 or in order to meet a statutory duty.
Regulation 3 sets out the scope of requests that may be made under this Part, the requirements that must be met before a request can be made and the information that must be included in a formal notice to the landlord that a request for arbitration is being made.
Regulation 4 provides that when considering a request, an arbitrator or third party may order the landlord to comply with the request, in full or in part, or make any award or determination they consider reasonable and just between the landlord and tenant having regard to all relevant matters.
Regulation 4(2) provides for additional considerations that may form part of the award or determination including costs, the time when the award or determination takes effect and any conditions to which the award or determination is subject. Regulation 4(3) provides that the arbitrator or third party must not make an award or determination which varies the rent of the holding. Regulations 4(4) and 4(5) provide that the arbitrator or third party must not make an award or determination which provides for compensation except to provide that any consent or variation to the tenancy must be disregarded for the purposes of assessing a claim for compensation made by a landlord under sections 71 to 73 of the 1986 Act. Regulation 4(6) provides that any award or determination takes effect as if the terms and provisions in it were contained in an agreement in writing entered into by the landlord and tenant by way of variation to the agreement previously in place in respect of the tenancy from the making of the award or determination or at any specified later date.
Part 3 sets out the criteria which a Tribunal must have regard to when determining an application by a person as to whether they are suitable to succeed to a tenancy of an agricultural holding under Part 4 of the 1986 Act following the death or retirement of a tenant. The Tribunal is required to consider all relevant matters and regulation 5(2) sets out a list of some of the matters which must be taken into account, including the person’s capability to farm the holding commercially, taking into account the need for high standards of efficient production and care for the environment in relation to managing the holding. It goes on to provide that, having considered all relevant matters, the Tribunal must be satisfied that if the applicant had applied in an open competition for that tenancy, a prudent and willing landlord could reasonably be expected to regard the applicant as among the candidates to whom they would be willing to grant the tenancy. All offers as to rent in respect of the holding and the age of the applicant must be disregarded under regulation 5(3).
Regulation 6 makes transitional provision.
Regulation 7 provides for a review of these Regulations by 13 June 2031 and at intervals not exceeding 5 years thereafter.

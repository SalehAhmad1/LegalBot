(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes changes to electoral arrangements for Northumberland following recommendations made by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. This Order does not change the boundary of the local authority itself.
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral divisions of Northumberland and replaces them with the 69 new ones listed in Schedule 1 for the purpose of elections to be held on or after the ordinary day of election of councillors in England in 2025. It also establishes the names and areas of the new electoral divisions and the number of councillors for each.
Article 4 makes changes to parish wards which are consequential on the changes made by article 3. The changes to parish wards introduced by article 4 come into force for the purpose of parish elections in 2025 and in respect of subsequent parish elections.
The area covered by each division created by this Order is identified on a map which is available for inspection at reasonable times at the offices of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, 1st Floor, Windsor House, 50 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0TL.
The map may also be accessed at: https://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/northumberland.

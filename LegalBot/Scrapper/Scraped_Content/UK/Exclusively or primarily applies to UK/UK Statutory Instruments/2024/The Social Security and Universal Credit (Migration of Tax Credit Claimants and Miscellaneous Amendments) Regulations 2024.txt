8th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments and modifications to various social security regulations.
Regulations 2, 3, 4 and 5 make amendments to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1967), the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/207), the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/213) and the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/794) to enable a loan for specific purposes paid in Scotland to be disregarded as student income when calculating entitlement to benefits in the same way as a special support loan is disregarded in England.
Regulation 6 makes amendments to regulation 5 of the Social Security (Payments on Account of Benefit) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/383), which contains provisions setting out the circumstances in which the Secretary of State may make a payment on account of benefit to a person, where their claim for benefit has been made but not yet determined, or where no claim is required but an award has not yet been made. The amendments add an additional requirement to the cumulative circumstances in which the Secretary of State may make a payment on account of benefit (also known as an “advance”) where such a payment is on account of universal credit. The additional requirement is that the person has been allocated a national insurance number.
Regulation 7 makes amendments to the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376). The amendments to regulation 2 update the definition of a foster parent as a result of changes to the legislative framework governing the placement of children. The amendment to regulation 4A ensures that a child element of universal credit can be paid where a child is placed for adoption with a claimant. The amendment to regulation 68 removes a young student’s bursary payable in Scotland from the definition of a student loan. The amendment to regulation 71 enables student income to be averaged across a year, or a period of study if shorter, even in circumstances where the claimant was not entitled to universal credit for part of that year or period of study, when calculating the amount of student income that is to be attributed to a claimant for a particular assessment period.
Regulation 8 makes amendments to the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1230) (‘the 2014 Regulations’). Regulation 8(2) revokes paragraphs (6) and (7) of regulation 6A, which allow claimants to claim and renew tax credits, from 6th April 2025, and amends paragraphs (1) and (8) accordingly. Regulation 8(3) amends regulation 12A to allow tax credit awards to be in year finalised where a claimant who has been invited to claim universal credit has not done so by their deadline date. Regulation 8(4) amends paragraph 16 of Schedule 1 following reform of the “basis period” for tax purposes in relation to trades, professions and vocations, under the Finance Act 2022 (c. 3).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

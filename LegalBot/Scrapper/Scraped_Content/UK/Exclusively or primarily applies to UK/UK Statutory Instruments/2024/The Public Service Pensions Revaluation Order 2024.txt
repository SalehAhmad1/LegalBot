Section 9 of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25) (revaluation) applies to pension schemes which, under that Act, require a revaluation of pensionable earnings, or a proportion of such earnings, accrued as a pension, by reference to a change in prices or earnings (or both) in a given period.
In relation to the period from 1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024 inclusive, article 2 of this Order specifies an increase in prices of 6.7 per cent, based on a measure of the year on year change in the Consumer Prices Index to September 2023; and an increase in earnings of 7.7 per cent, based on a measure of the year on year change in average weekly earnings to September 2023.
This Order comes into force on 1st April 2024 but, for the schemes specified in article 1(4), this Order will have effect from 6th April 2024.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

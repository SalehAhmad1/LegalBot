6th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
The Planning Act 2008 (c. 29) provides for the granting of development consent for certain types of nationally significant infrastructure projects.
This instrument amends the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010 (“the 2010 Rules”).
Rule 3 removes the requirement in Rule 10 of the 2010 Rules for a minimum of 21 days’ notice to be given by the Examining authority when specifying the date by which a written representation is to be received.
Rule 4 amends Rule 13 of the 2010 Rules by removing certain minimum notice periods relating to notification of hearings under sections 92(2) and 93(1) of the Act. It also expands the meaning of “by local advertisement” to include by publication on the applicant’s website.
Rule 5 amends Rule 22 of the 2010 Rules by removing the requirement for consent to be given by the recipient for any representation, notice or other document required or authorised to be sent under any provision of the Rules by electronic transmission.
Rule 6 is a transitional provision so that the amendments in these rules do not apply to any application for an order granting development consent under section 37 of the Act made before 30th April 2024.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

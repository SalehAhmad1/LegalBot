“Purchase of service during the extended limited period – total pensionable service
6D.—(1) This rule applies where—

a person joined this Scheme as a special member or as a standard member in respect of service which that person could otherwise reckon as special pensionable service and purchased service following an application under rule 5A of this Part,
(b)
that person purchased additional service under rule 5 of this Part at the same time as the election under rule 5A,
(c)
that person elects to purchase service in respect of the extended limited period under rule 5B of this Part, and
(d)
the addition of the period of service in respect of the extended limited period to the member’s special pensionable service (within the meaning of rule 2A(1) of Part 10) would result in a period exceeding 30 years.
(2) The authority must revise the election to purchase additional service under rule 5, in accordance with paragraph (3), so that the total special pensionable service does not exceed 30 years by the member’s normal retirement age.
(3) The period by which the total special pensionable service would exceed 30 years (“the excess service”) at the member’s normal retirement age is to be deducted from the additional service which the member elected to purchase under rule 5.
(4) Any contributions paid by the member in respect of the excess service are to be deducted from the contributions due in respect of the service in respect of the extended limited period purchased under rule 5B.
(5) Where the contributions paid by the member in respect of the excess service exceed the contributions due in respect of the service purchased under rule 5B, the authority is to refund the excess contributions to the member.
Compensation deduction
6E.—(1) The authority must deduct from a special member’s mandatory special period pension contributions an amount calculated in accordance with this rule (the “compensation deduction”) where that special member—
(a)
elects to pay mandatory special period pension contributions in respect of the special member’s service during the mandatory special period in accordance with rule 6A of this Part, in relation to service purchased following an application under rule 5B of this Part, and
(b)
provides the statement referred to in paragraph (5).
(2) The compensation deduction must—
(a)
be calculated on the advice of the Scheme Actuary;
(b)
be equal to the amount of tax relief on mandatory special period pension contributions to which the special member would have been entitled in the compensation scenario described in paragraph (3) (“the compensation scenario”);
(c)
include interest calculated at the past interest rate and applied to that amount of tax relief as described under rule 6A(13), having taken into account any tax relief on mandatory special period pension contributions that has been received through PAYE.
(3) The compensation scenario means that it is assumed that—
(a)
the special member had been entitled to join this Scheme as a special member on the first day of the mandatory special period,
(b)
from that date, the special member had paid the mandatory special period contributions in accordance with rule 3(1A) of Part 11 (pension contributions), deducted from each instalment of the member’s pensionable pay in accordance with rule 3(2) of that Part, and
(c)
tax relief on the special period pension contributions at the rate set out in paragraph (4) had been applied at the time each instalment of pensionable pay had been paid.
(4) The rate of tax relief which must be applied in the compensation scenario is—
(a)
where a member establishes, with such supporting evidence as the authority may reasonably require, that the rate of tax relief which would have applied to the special member in the compensation scenario is a higher tax rate, that higher tax rate, or
(b)
in any other case, the basic tax rate that would have applied to the special member during the mandatory special period.
(5) In order to be entitled to the compensation deduction, the special member must provide a statement to the authority that the special member will not claim tax relief in respect of the mandatory special period pension contributions.”

S.I. 2007/3193 (W. 280).
(3)
Article 3A(3) was inserted by S.I. 2017/168 (W. 49).EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends Schedule 2 to the Firemen’s Pension Scheme Order 1992 (which sets out the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (Wales) 1992) and Schedule 1 to the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (Wales) Order 2007 (which sets out “the 2007 Pension Scheme”), to extend the period during which persons who were employed in Wales as retained firefighters have access to a pension scheme.
The Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (Wales) (Amendment) Order 2014 amended the 2007 Pension Scheme to provide those persons who were employed in Wales as retained firefighters during the period from 1 July 2000 to 5 April 2006 inclusive with access to a pension scheme for that period. This Order extends that period so that it can begin from 7 April 2000, or, in cases where a person was employed as a retained firefighter on 7 April 2000 and first took up that employment on an earlier date, this Order extends that period so that it begins on that earlier date (“the extended limited period”).
Schedule 1 to this Order amends the 2007 Pension Scheme.
Paragraphs 1 and 2 amend Parts 1 (title and interpretation) and 2 (scheme membership, cessation and retirement) of the 2007 Pension Scheme to provide for the extended limited period.
Paragraph 3 amends Part 3 (personal awards) of the 2007 Pension Scheme to provide for applications for recalculations of retrospective awards on ill-health retirement where a person purchases service in relation to the extended limited period.
Paragraph 4 inserts new rules 1B and 1C into Part 5 (awards on death) of the 2007 Pension Scheme to provide for the award of death grants in relation to the extended limited period.
Paragraph 5 makes minor amendments to Part 10 (qualifying service and pensionable service) of the 2007 Pension Scheme to reflect the extended limited period.
Paragraph 6 inserts new rules 5B, 5C, 6D and 6E into Part 11 (pensionable pay, pension contributions and purchase of additional service) of the 2007 Pension Scheme. They provide for the purchase of service during the extended limited period and make provision in relation to payments to an authority for that service.
Paragraph 7 amends Part 12 (transfers into and out of the Scheme) of the 2007 Pension Scheme and inserts rules 19 and 20 into that Part, to provide for the conversion of service purchased during the extended limited period. It also provides for cases where a conversion decision was made previously, and service is now purchased during the extended limited period.
Paragraphs 8 and 9 amend Part 14 (payment of awards) and Annex 1 (ill health pensions) of the 2007 Pension Scheme respectively to make provision relating to the extended limited period.
Article 3 of this Order makes a consequential amendment to the Firefighter’s Pension Scheme (Wales) 1992, which is set out in Schedule 2 to the Firemen’s Pension Scheme Order 1992.
This Order also amends the Firefighters’ Compensation Scheme (Wales) Order 2007. Schedule 2 amends Schedule 1 to that Order to allow awards to be made in relation to injury sustained while a person is performing certain duties other than fire-fighting under a temporary secondary employment with the same fire and rescue authority. In those cases, any injury will be treated as if it were sustained under the person’s primary employment, and consequently an award will be based on service and pay under that primary employment. The amendments also provide that where a person is performing duties under a secondary retained employment with the same fire and rescue authority, any injury will be treated as if it were sustained under the person’s regular service employment, meaning that an award will be based on the person’s service and pay under that regular service contract.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order. A copy can be obtained from the Fire Services Branch, Welsh Government, Rhydycar, Merthyr Tydfil, CF48 1UZ and is published on www.gov.wales.

MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply with the necessary modifications as respects compensation in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A)(1) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act, substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 5 to the Network Rail (Cambridge Re-Signalling) Order 2024 (“the 2024 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 5 to the 2024 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purposes of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(2) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for the words “land is acquired or taken” substitute “a right over land is purchased”; and
(b)
for the words “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act of 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 5 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 4 (power to acquire land) applies to a compulsory acquisition of rights under article 7 (power to acquire new rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or
(b)
the land over which the right is, or is to be, exercisable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in the case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had, not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure of owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraph 2(3) and 8(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be acquired compulsorily is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(3) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority have served notice to treat in respect of any right as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 5(1)), it has power, exercisable in the equivalent circumstances and subject to the equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A(4) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(5) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(6) (unauthorised entry) and 13(7) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of that Act are modified accordingly.
(6) Section 20(8) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of the land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 5(6) (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A

Introduction
1.  This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over a house, building or factory.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” include any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.

(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the proposed use of the right to be acquired, and
(c)
if the right is proposed to be acquired for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

SCHEDULE 6
APPARATUS OF STATUTORY UNDERTAKERS, ETC. IN STOPPED UP STREETS
1.  Where a street it stopped up under article 3 (stopping up of streets) any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, along or across that street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus, subject to the provisions of this Schedule, as if this Order had not been made.
2.  Where a street is stopped up under article 3 any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, over, along or across that street may, and if reasonably requested to do so by Network Rail must—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus in substitution for it in such other position as the statutory utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in that other position.
3.  Subject to the following provisions of this Schedule, Network Rail must pay to any statutory utility an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the statutory utility in or in connection with—
(a)
the execution of the relocation works required in consequence of the stopping up of the street; and
(b)
the doing of any other work or thing rendered necessary by the execution of the relocation works.
4.  If in the course of execution of relocation works under paragraph 3—
(a)
apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of paragraph 3 is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
5.  For the purposes of paragraph 4—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
6.  An amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be payable to a statutory utility in respect of works by virtue of paragraph 3 (and having regard, where relevant, to paragraph 4) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the statutory utility any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
7.  Paragraphs 3 to 6 do not apply where the authorised works constitute major transport works for the purpose of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act, but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of cost of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section; and
(b)
the allowable costs are to be borne by Network Rail and the statutory utility in such proportions as may be prescribed by any such regulations.
8.  In this Schedule—
“apparatus” has the same meaning as in Part 3 of the 1991 Act;
“relocation works” means work executed, or apparatus provided, under paragraph 2; and
“statutory utility” means a statutory undertaker for the purposes of the 1980 Act(1) or a public communications provider as defined in section 151(1) (interpretation of chapter 1) of the Communications Act 2003(2).

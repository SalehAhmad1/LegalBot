(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision specifying four scientific methods that may be used for the purposes of age assessments on age-disputed persons (age-disputed persons are persons subject to immigration control where there is not enough evidence to be sure of their age) under section 50 or 51 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 (c. 36).
Regulation 2 specifies the four scientific methods: (a) the use of radiographs to assess the mandibular third molars; (b) the use of radiographs to assess the bones in the hand and wrist; (c) the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the distal femur and proximal tibia; and (d) the use of MRI to assess the clavicle.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order introduces management measures and a permitting regime for the management of the exploitation of cockles from cockle beds within the specified area in Wales.
The Order, which applies in relation to Wales, amends or revokes and replaces the Byelaws of the former North Western and North Wales Sea Fisheries Committee and the former South Wales Sea Fisheries Committee and provisions of the Cockles and Mussels (Specified Areas) (Wales) Order 2011 in so far as they regulate cockle fishing.
The Sea Fisheries Committees were abolished in relation to Wales on 1 April 2010 when the Sea Fisheries Regulation Act 1966 was repealed by section 187 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.
The Byelaws of the former North Western and North Wales Sea Fisheries Committee and former South Wales Sea Fisheries Committee have had effect since 1 April 2010 as if made by the Welsh Ministers in a statutory instrument by virtue of article 13(1) and (3) and Schedules 3 and 4 to the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (Commencement No. 1, Consequential, Transitional and Savings Provisions) (England and Wales) Order 2010.
Part 1 of this Order (articles 1 and 2) deals with introductory matters.
Part 2 of this Order (articles 3 to 7) makes provision for the management of cockle beds within the specified area. Fishing for and taking cockles from cockle beds which are closed and without a permit is prohibited under article 3. Articles 5 to 7 provide for the assessment and the opening and closing of cockle beds within the specified area.
The specified area is described in Schedule 1.
Part 3 of this Order (articles 8 to 13 and Schedule 2) makes provision for a new cockle permitting regime setting out the requirement for a permit to fish and making provision about eligibility, the duration of a permit and fees. Article 9 and Schedule 2 provide for conditions to be attached to permits.
Part 4 of this Order (articles 14 to 18 and Schedule 3) makes provision for exemptions from the provisions of this Order, the re-deposit of cockles and for the revocation and amendment of various Byelaws of the former North Western and North Wales and the former South Wales Sea Fisheries Committees and the amendment of the Cockles and Mussels (Specified Area) (Wales) Order 2011.

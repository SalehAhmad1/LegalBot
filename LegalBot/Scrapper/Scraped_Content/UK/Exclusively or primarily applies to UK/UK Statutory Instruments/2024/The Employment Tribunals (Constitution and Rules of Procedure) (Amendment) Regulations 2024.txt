(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Schedule 1 to the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/1237) sets out the rules of procedure that apply in the Employment Tribunals. These Regulations make amendments to those rules.
Regulation 2(3) amends rule 15 (sending claim form to respondents) to enable the Tribunal to direct that the time limit provided under rule 16(1) (response) for the presentation of a response to the Tribunal begins from the date that the Tribunal sends a copy of the claim form to an alternative address to that provided by the claim form. Where such a direction is made any earlier sending by the Tribunal of a copy of the claim form to an address provided in the claim form is disregarded for the purposes of rule 16(1). Regulation 2(6) amends rule 86 (delivery to parties) as a consequence of amendments to this rule.
Regulation 2(4) amends rule 16(1) to specify that in addition to the requirement for a response to be presented to the Tribunal on the prescribed form and within the relevant time limit, a response must also comply with any requirement specified by practice direction. Regulation 2(5) amends rule 85(2) (delivery to the tribunal) as a consequence of amendments to this rule.
Regulation 2(7) inserts a new rule 92A (digital case management) to provide that where provision is made by practice direction to allow for the delivery of documents to a party or the Tribunal through the Tribunal’s digital case management system, and where a party or the Tribunal complies with those requirements then they will also be deemed to have complied with any requirements in the rules to provide a document to the Tribunal or another party.
Regulation 2(2) amends rule 8(1) (presenting the claim) to remove redundant drafting.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

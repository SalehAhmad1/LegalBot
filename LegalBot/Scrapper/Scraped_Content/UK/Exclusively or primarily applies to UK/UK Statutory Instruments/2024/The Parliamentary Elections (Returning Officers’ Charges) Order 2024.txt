(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides for payments for services and expenses of returning officers in connection with the conduct of parliamentary elections in England, Wales and Scotland. It replaces the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers’ Charges) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/1454), except in relation to parliamentary elections for which the day of poll is before the coming into force of this Order.
Articles 2 and 3 set the maximum recoverable amounts for specified services (listed in article 2(2) and specified expenses (listed in article 3(2)) respectively for each constituency. Article 4 sets the overall maximum recoverable amount for each constituency. The table in the Schedule sets out those maximum amounts.
Article 5 sets an alternative overall maximum recoverable amount where a particular parliamentary election is uncontested.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

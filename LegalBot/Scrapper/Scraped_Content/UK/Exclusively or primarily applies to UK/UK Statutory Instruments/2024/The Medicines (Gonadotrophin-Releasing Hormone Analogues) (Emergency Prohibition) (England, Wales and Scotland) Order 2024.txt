(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order prohibits, subject to exceptions, the retail sale, and the supply in circumstances corresponding to retail, of medicinal products that consist of or contain a list of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (“GnRH”) analogues (article 3).
Orders for GnRH analogues in pursuance of NHS prescriptions or directions are excluded from the prohibition (article 4).
In the case of orders in pursuance of private prescriptions or directions, different conditions apply depending on the age of the patients. If the patient is 18 or over, GnRH analogues can continue to be supplied for any purposes, subject to prescription formalities in some cases, and age and identity checks in others (article 5).
If the private prescription or direction is for a child who is under 18 when the prescription or direction is issued, in addition to prescription formalities or potential identity checks, only a limited range of authorised prescribers will be able to have new prescriptions dispensed going forward, a list which does not include prescribers who are not United Kingdom registered. Also, the prescription or direction must be for a purpose other than treatment for the purpose of puberty suppression in respect of either or a combination of gender dysphoria and gender incongruence. However, if a child under 18 started a course of treatment with a GnRH analogue before 3rd June 2024, GnRH analogues may continue to be sold supplied to or for them, if the other conditions for private prescribing for such children are met.
An assessment of the effect of this instrument was undertaken and it was deemed that a full impact assessment would not be undertaken. These Regulations are not expected to have a significant impact on the public and voluntary sectors, and only a limited impact on the private sector, below the threshold for undertaking a full impact assessment.

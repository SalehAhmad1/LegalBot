(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (“the GPDO”). The GPDO provides for the granting of permission for certain classes of development without the requirement for a planning application to be made under Part 3 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
Class MA of Part 3 (changes of use) of Schedule 2 to the GPDO permits the change of use of commercial, business and service uses to use as dwellinghouses. Article 3 of this Order amends Class MA to remove the requirement that a building must have been vacant for a continuous period of at least 3 months immediately prior to the date of an application for prior approval. Additionally, Class MA is amended to remove the floorspace upper limit for buildings changing use under the right.

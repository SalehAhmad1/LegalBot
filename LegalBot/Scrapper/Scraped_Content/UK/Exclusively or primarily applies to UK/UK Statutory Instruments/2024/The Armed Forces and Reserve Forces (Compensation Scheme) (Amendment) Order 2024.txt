(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces (Compensation Scheme) Order 2011 (S.I. 2011/527) (the “Principal Order”), which provides for benefits to be payable to, or in respect of a person by reason of injury, illness or death caused wholly or partly, by service in the regular or reserve armed forces.
Article 4 amends article 24A of the Principal Order to increase the amount of the allowance known as “the armed forces independence payment” which is designed to provide financial support to cover extra costs that a recipient of that benefit may incur as a result of a relevant injury. That amount is increased to £184.30 per week.
Article 5 amends article 24D of the Principal Order to increase the amount that may be paid in settlement of liabilities due under an agreement between a claimant and Motability in respect of the hire or hire purchase of a vehicle. That amount is increased to £75.75 per week.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

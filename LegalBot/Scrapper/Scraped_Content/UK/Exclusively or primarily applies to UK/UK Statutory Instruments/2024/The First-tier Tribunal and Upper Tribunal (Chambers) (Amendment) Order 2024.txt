(This note is not part of the Order)
The First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal (Chambers) Order 2010 (S.I. 2010/2655) (“the 2010 Order”) organises the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal into chambers and makes provision for the allocation of those tribunals’ functions between the chambers.
This Order amends the 2010 Order to reflect the conferral of further jurisdictions on the First-tier Tribunal relating to proceedings under Schedule 3A to the Communications Act 2003 (c. 21) (the Electronic Communications Code) by the Electronic Communications Code (Jurisdiction) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1220). It also makes consequential amendments and savings provisions in relation to the allocation of those proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.
Additionally this Order makes provision for appeals against the exercise by the Gambling Commission of functions under Part 3 of the Finance Act 2022 (c. 3) to be allocated to the Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal; appeals against the exercise of related functions by His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs are already allocated to that chamber.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Swansea, West Glamorgan 
during flying displays for the general public which are due to take place there on 6th July 2024 
and 7th July 2024. 
A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and 
therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should 
be restricted in the vicinity of the displays for reasons of public safety. 
These Regulations apply except insofar as flying is already prohibited by the Air Navigation 
(Restriction of Flying) (Prisons and Young Offender Institutions) (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1101). 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in Regulation 3(2)(b), the Wales Airshow Swansea flying 
director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr Alan Frew, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 382734.

to a magistrates’ court or to the Crown Court for trial.

for trial; an offence classified as triable only summarily must be tried in a 
magistrates’ court; and an offence classified as triable either way, on indictment 
or summarily, must be allocated to one or the other court for trial, subject to the

allocation there), in this sequence— 
 
(i) any one or more that the court must send for trial because of section 51(1) or

(iii) any the court may send for trial under paragraph (4) of this rule; and 
(c) any to which rule 9.23 applies (Sending after allocation for Crown Court trial). 
(3) Where the court on the same or separate occasions considers the cases of two or more 
defendants charged jointly with an offence, if the court sends one of those defendants to the 
Crown Court for trial for that offence— 
(a) on the same occasion the court must so send each other defendant so charged even 
if by then the court has decided to allocate that other defendant for magistrates’ 
court trial; and 
(b) on a subsequent occasion the court may so send another defendant so charged; but 
(c) where a jointly charged defendant is under 18— 
 
(i) unless the jointly charged offence is one that falls within section 51A(12) of 
the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (homicide and certain offences involving 
weapons), before the court sends that defendant to the Crown Court for that 
offence the court must take a plea indication from that defendant under

where that applies) and deal with the defendant accordingly, and 
 
(ii) if the defendant indicates a not guilty plea then the court may send that

defendant whose case it is considering to the Crown Court for trial for an offence because 
of section 51(1) or section 51A(A1) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (in this rule, ‘a 
lead offence’)— 
(a) on the same occasion as that sending the court must send that defendant to the 
Crown Court for trial for any other indictable or summary offence with which that 
defendant is charged (in this rule, ‘a connected offence’)— 
 
(i) if the circumstances of that other offence appear to the court to be the same as, 
or connected with, those giving rise to a lead offence, and 
 
(ii) where the connected offence is a summary offence, if it is one to which 
section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 applies (specified summary 
offences founded on the prosecution evidence), or one which is punishable 
with imprisonment, or one which involves obligatory or discretionary 
disqualification from driving, but 
 
(iii) where the defendant is under 18, only if the court considers it necessary in the 
interests of justice to do so; 
(b) on the same occasion as that sending, if another defendant whose case the court is 
considering is charged with a connected offence then the court must send that other 
defendant to the Crown Court for trial for that offence, subject to paragraph (4)(d) 
if it applies; 
(c) on an occasion subsequent to that sending the court may send any defendant whose 
case it is considering to the Crown Court for trial for a connected offence with 
which that defendant is charged, subject to paragraph (4)(d) if it applies; and 
(d) where a defendant to whom paragraph (4)(b) or (4)(c) refers is under 18 then— 
 
20
 
(i) a connected offence for which that defendant is sent for trial must be an 
indictable offence, 
 
(ii) unless the connected offence is one that falls within section 51A(12) of the 
Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (homicide and certain offences involving 
weapons), before the court sends that defendant to the Crown Court for that 
offence the court must take a plea indication from that defendant under 
section 24A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 (or section 24B of that Act, 
where that applies) and deal with the defendant accordingly, and 
 
(iii) if the defendant indicates a not guilty plea then the court may send that 
defendant for Crown Court trial only if the court considers it necessary in the 
interests of justice to do so. 
(5) The court must require the defendant to provide or confirm the defendant’s name and 
date of birth in response to a notice served on the defendant under— 
(a) rule 9.8(3) (Sending by written procedure for Crown Court trial); 
(b) rule 9.10(2) (Request by written procedure for plea indication); or 
(c) rule 9.19(2) (Allocation by written procedure for youth court or Crown Court 
trial). 
(6) At a hearing, the court— 
(a) must, as a general rule, exercise its powers in public, but it may exercise any 
power it has to— 
 
(i) withhold information from the public, or 
 
(ii) order a hearing in private; and 
(b) may exercise its power to adjourn— 
 
(i) if either party asks, or 
 
(ii) on its own initiative. 
(7) At a hearing the general rule is that the court must exercise its powers in the 
defendant’s presence (which presence may be by live link or through a legal 
representative), but it may exercise the powers to which the following rules apply in the 
defendant’s absence on the conditions specified— 
(a) where rule 9.9 (Sending at a hearing for Crown Court trial) applies, after following 
the procedure in rule 9.8 (Sending by written procedure for Crown Court trial); 
(b) where rule 9.14 (Request at a hearing for plea indication), rule 9.16 (Not guilty 
plea indication at a hearing) or rule 9.17 (Allocation for magistrates’ court trial at a 
hearing) applies, if the court is satisfied that it is not contrary to the interests of 
justice to proceed in the defendant’s absence and— 
 
(i) the defendant’s legal representative is present and either that representative 
tells the court that the defendant agrees to it proceeding in the defendant’s 
absence or the court does not consider that there is an acceptable reason for 
the defendant’s failure to attend, 
 
(ii) either the court is satisfied that the defendant had reasonable notice of the 
hearing or the defendant has attended a previous hearing in the case and in 
either case the court does not consider that there is an acceptable reason for 
the defendant’s failure to attend, or 
 
(iii) the defendant’s disorderly conduct at the hearing makes it impracticable to 
proceed in the defendant’s presence; 
(c) where rule 9.21 (Allocation at a hearing for youth court or Crown Court trial) 
applies, when the court asks the defendant for a plea indication, guilty or not 
guilty, if— 
 
(i) the defendant’s legal representative is present, 
 
21
 
(ii) the defendant’s disorderly conduct at the hearing makes it impracticable to 
proceed in the defendant’s presence, and 
 
(iii) the court considers that it should proceed in the defendant’s absence; 
(d) where rule 9.21 (Allocation at a hearing for youth court or Crown Court trial) 
applies, after the court asks the defendant for a plea indication if— 
 
(i) the defendant has given no notice of plea indication under rule 9.19 
(Allocation by written procedure for youth court or Crown Court trial), 
 
(ii) either the court is satisfied that the defendant had reasonable notice of the 
hearing or the defendant has attended a previous hearing in the case and in 
either case the court does not consider that there is an acceptable reason for 
the defendant’s failure to attend, and 
 
(iii) the court is satisfied that it is not contrary to the interests of justice to proceed 
in the defendant’s absence; and 
(e) where rule 9.24 (Committal for sentence for offence related to an offence sent for 
trial) applies, unless— 
 
(i) it appears to the court to be contrary to the interests of justice to do so, and 
 
(ii) the court considers that there is an acceptable reason for the defendant’s 
absence. 
(8) Where the defendant is under 18— 
(a) if rule 9.8 or rule 9.19 applies (Sending by written procedure for Crown Court 
trial; Allocation by written procedure for youth court or Crown Court trial), unless 
the court is satisfied that it would be unreasonable to do so having regard to the 
circumstances of the case the court may, in any case, and where the defendant is 
under 16 the court must— 
 
(i) ask whether a parent or guardian of the defendant is aware of the written 
proceedings, and 
 
(ii) if that may not be so then serve on at least one such person the notices, 
explanations and requests required by whichever of those rules applies; 
(b) if the defendant gives notice of a guilty or not guilty plea under rule 9.19, unless 
the court is satisfied that it would be unreasonable to do so having regard to the 
circumstances of the case the court may, in any case, and where the defendant is 
under 16 the court must— 
 
(i) ask whether a parent or guardian of the defendant is aware of that, and 
 
(ii) if that may not be so then serve on at least one such person notice that the 
defendant has given that plea indication; and 
(c) if there is to be a hearing, unless the court is satisfied that it would be unreasonable 
to do so having regard to the circumstances of the case— 
 
(i) the court must require a parent or guardian of the defendant to attend where 
the defendant is under 16, and 
 
(ii) may require such a person to attend where the defendant is over 16.

Under sections 51(3A), (3B) and 51A(4A), (4B) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998(b), 
Criminal Procedure Rules may make provision about situations where a defendant is sent 
to the Crown Court for trial for an alleged offence and any other offence is, or appears to 
be, related (in such a way as is specified in the Rules) to that alleged offence. 
Under section 51 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the court may require a defendant to 
attend by live link a hearing to which this Part applies. 
Part 46 contains rules allowing a representative to act on a defendant’s behalf for the 
purposes of these Rules. Rules 9.8 and 9.17 set out procedures that apply where neither the 
defendant nor the defendant’s legal representative attends a hearing to which those rules 
apply. 
Where a defendant waives the right to be present then the court may nonetheless require his 
or her attendance by summons or warrant: see section 26 of the 1980 Act(c).

of proceedings at which the court must require the information listed in rule 9.2(5) and may

commits an offence if, without reasonable excuse, that person fails to comply with such a 
requirement, whether by providing false or incomplete information or by providing no 
information.

circumstances requires, the court to notify a parent or guardian and require their 
attendance.

Prosecutor’s notice requiring Crown Court trial

the management of the case should without delay be taken over by the Crown 
Court. 
Under section 51C of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998(b), the Director of Public 
Prosecutions may require the court to send for trial in the Crown Court a case involving 
one of certain specified violent or sexual offences if, in the Director’s opinion— 
(a) the evidence of the offence would be sufficient for the person charged to be put on 
trial for that offence;

otherwise would be served, or

place specified in the notice, and 
 
(iii) advising the defendant to consult a legal representative and giving information 
about how to find a representative if the defendant does not already have one; 
(b) explanations that— 
 
(i) because at least one offence of which the defendant is accused can only be 
tried in the Crown Court, or for some other reason must or can be sent for trial 
there, the court expects to send the defendant for Crown Court trial, 
 
(ii) the court can send the defendant without a hearing for Crown Court trial, 
 
(iii) if the court sends the defendant without a hearing for Crown Court trial it will 
be on bail, which will be without conditions if the defendant is already on

the defendant is already on conditional bail, 
 
(iv) the parties may make any written representations they wish to make about the

preparation of the case for trial in the Crown Court, and may supply in writing 
such information as the court requires for the purposes of case management,

Court, guilty or not guilty, to each offence of which the defendant is accused,

electronic arrangements to which that paragraph refers then the court officer must give by 
those means— 
(a) an explanation that an indication of intended plea in the Crown Court— 
 
(i) does not of itself constitute a plea, there will be a court hearing for the 
defendant to confirm that plea, and the defendant will be able to withdraw that 
indication before the plea is taken in court, but 
 
(ii) the defendant is likely to receive a reduced sentence as a result of indicating at 
once an intention to plead guilty and then pleading guilty in the Crown Court; 
(b) a request that the parties— 
 
(i) make such representations as the parties wish to make about the exercise of 
the court’s powers and about any ancillary matters, including the preparation 
of the case for trial in the Crown Court, and 
 
(ii) give such information as the court requires for the purposes of case 
management; 
(c) a request that the defendant gives an indication of intended plea in the Crown 
Court to each offence of which the defendant is accused; and 
 
28
(d) a warning that if after considering such responses as are received the court requires 
a hearing for the defendant to attend after all— 
 
(i) the court officer will so notify the parties, 
 
(ii) if the defendant fails to attend that hearing then the defendant may be arrested 
and, if the defendant is on bail, then as well as being arrested may be punished 
and bail may be withdrawn, and 
 
(iii) with or without a hearing the defendant may be sent for trial. 
(6) No sooner than the earlier of the date specified under paragraph (3)(c) or the receipt 
from both parties of responses to the requests under paragraph (5) the court must— 
(a) consider any responses to those requests; and 
(b) decide whether to— 
 
(i) send the defendant by written notice to the Crown Court for trial, or 
 
(ii) require a hearing, or further hearing, under rule 9.9 (Sending at a hearing for 
Crown Court trial). 
(7) In deciding whether to require such a hearing, or further hearing, the court must have 
regard to— 
(a) any need, in the court’s opinion, for a hearing to— 
 
(i) consider bail, or 
 
(ii) collect or consider information required for the purposes of case management; 
(b) any indication that the defendant has no legal representative; and 
(c) any other circumstance which in the court’s opinion makes such a hearing 
necessary. 
(8) If the court decides to send the defendant by written notice to the Crown Court for 
trial— 
(a) the court must give any ancillary directions; and 
(b) the court officer must— 
 
(i) issue a notice of sending under rule 9.5(1),

hearing in the Crown Court, and

an offence for which the defendant may be arrested and punished and bail 
may be withdrawn. 
(9) If the court requires a hearing, or further hearing, under rule 9.9 (Sending at a hearing 
for Crown Court trial) the court officer must so notify the parties.

51A(3A), (3B) of the 1998 Act, unless the defendant is present before the court a 
magistrates’ court must follow the written procedure described in this rule except in 
circumstances for which Criminal Procedure Rules provide: see sections 51(2D), (2E) and 
51A(3D), (3E). 
A defendant will be present at a hearing to which rule 9.9 applies if arrested and brought to 
court in custody. A hearing to which rule 9.9 will apply will have been arranged if a 
defendant is not in custody but has been required to attend court for such a hearing. 
Rule 9.5 (Duty of magistrates’ court officer) prescribes the content of a record of sending.] 
Sending at a hearing for Crown Court trial 
9.9.—(1) This rule applies at a hearing where a magistrates’ court must, or can, send a 
defendant to the Crown Court for trial without first allocating the case for trial there. 
(2) The court must read the allegation of the offence to the defendant. 
(3) The court must explain, in terms the defendant can understand (with help, if 
necessary)— 
(a) the allegation, unless it is self-explanatory; 
(b) that the offence is one for which the court, as appropriate— 
 
(i) must send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial, or 
 
(ii) may send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial if the court decides that 
the offence is connected with one already sent for trial there; and 
(c) that reporting restrictions apply, which the defendant may ask the court to vary or 
remove. 
(4) In the following sequence, the court must then— 
(a) invite the prosecutor to— 
 
(i) identify the court’s power to send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial 
for the offence, and 
 
(ii) make representations about any ancillary matters, including bail and 
directions for the management of the case in the Crown Court; 
(b) invite the defendant to make representations about— 
 
(i) the court’s power to send the defendant to the Crown Court, and 
 
(ii) any ancillary matters; 
(c) invite the parties to supply such information as the court requires for the purposes 
of case management; and 
(d) send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial, in custody or on bail. 
(5) If the court sends the defendant to the Crown Court for trial, it must— 
(a) ask whether the defendant intends to plead guilty in the Crown Court and— 
 
(i) if the answer is ‘yes’, make arrangements for the Crown Court to take the 
defendant’s plea as soon as possible, or 
 
(ii) if the defendant does not answer, or the answer is ‘no’, make arrangements for 
a case management hearing in the Crown Court; and 
(b) give any other ancillary directions. 
                                                                                                                                            
Section 24A was inserted by section 336 of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 to, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44) and 
amended by section 416 of, and paragraph 49 of Schedule 24 to, the Sentencing Act 2020 (c. 17) and section 50 of, and 
paragraph 14 of Schedule 13 to, the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Act 2021 (c. 11). It is further amended by 
paragraphs 6, 9 and 10 of Schedule 2 to the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (c. 35) with effect from a date to be 
appointed.

(6) Where the court decides to exercise the powers to which this rule applies in the 
defendant’s absence— 
(a) paragraphs (2) to (5) do not apply; and 
(b) rule 9.8 applies instead (Sending by written procedure for Crown Court trial). 
[Note. See sections 51, 51A and 52 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and sections 22A 
and 24A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. Under section 51(2B) of the 1998 Act, if the 
defendant is absent the court must serve specified documents before sending for trial: see 
rule 9.8. 
Rule 9.5 (Duty of magistrates’ court officer) prescribes the content of a record of sending. 
See also Part 6 (Reporting, etc. restrictions).] 
 
ALLOCATION FOR TRIAL: ADULT DEFENDANTS 
Request by written procedure for plea indication 
9.10.—(1) This rule— 
(a) applies where— 
 
(i) the defendant is 18 or over, and 
 
(ii) the court must decide whether a case should be tried in a magistrates’ court or 
in the Crown Court; but 
(b) does not apply where— 
 
(i) the defendant is present at a hearing to which rule 9.14 applies (Request at a 
hearing for plea indication), or 
 
(ii) such a hearing is due to take place less than 15 business days after the notice, 
explanations and warning required by paragraph (2) otherwise would be 
served. 
(2) The court officer must serve on the parties— 
(a) notice— 
 
(i) that the court will consider the offence or offences of which the defendant is 
accused on a date and at a time and place specified in the notice, with a 
statement of each offence, and 
 
(ii) advising the defendant to consult a legal representative and giving information 
about how to find a representative if the defendant does not already have one; 
(b) explanations that— 
 
(i) because the court must decide whether the defendant’s case should be tried in 
a magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court a hearing for that purpose has been 
arranged, 
 
(ii) instead of attending that hearing the defendant may give a written plea 
indication, guilty or not guilty, to each offence of which the defendant is 
accused, 
 
(iii) only legal representatives have access to the electronic arrangements needed 
to give a written plea indication, and 
 
(iv) if the defendant uses those electronic arrangements then the court officer will 
provide more information about the procedure; and 
(c) a warning that if the defendant gives no plea indication using those electronic 
arrangements by a date specified in the notice then the hearing to which the notice 
refers will take place and— 
 
31
 
(i) if the defendant fails to attend that hearing then the defendant may be arrested 
and, if the defendant is on bail, then as well as being arrested may be punished 
and bail may be withdrawn, 
 
(ii) the case may proceed anyway without the court having been able to take 
account of any representations and information that the defendant might want 
to make or give. 
(3) The date specified under paragraph (2)(c) must be not less than 8 business days after 
service of the notice, explanations and warning required by paragraph (2). 
(4) If by the date specified under paragraph (2)(c) the defendant uses the electronic 
arrangements to which that paragraph refers then the court officer must give the defendant 
by those means— 
(a) explanations that— 
 
(i) a plea indication does not of itself constitute a plea, there will be a court 
hearing for the defendant to confirm that plea, and the defendant will be able 
to withdraw the plea indication before the case is sent for trial or the plea is 
taken in court, 
 
(ii) if the defendant indicates an intention to plead guilty then the court officer 
will arrange a hearing at which the plea will be taken in court, and if the 
defendant then pleads guilty the court will pass sentence or commit the 
defendant for sentence to the Crown Court, 
 
(iii) if the defendant indicates an intention to plead not guilty and the court then, 
without a hearing, sends the defendant for trial in the Crown Court it will be 
on bail, which will be without conditions if the defendant is already on 
unconditional bail or is not on bail at all, or will be subject to the same 
conditions if the defendant is already on conditional bail, 
 
(iv) if the defendant is sent for trial on bail, failure to attend at the Crown Court 
when required is an offence for which the defendant may be arrested and 
punished and bail may be withdrawn, and 
 
(v) if the defendant gives a plea indication then the court officer will provide 
more information about the procedure and will ask for more information from 
the defendant; 
(b) a request that the defendant gives a plea indication; and 
(c) a warning that if the defendant gives a plea indication but later withdraws it, or 
during the written procedure asks for a hearing, the hearing to which the paragraph 
(2) notice refers will take place and— 
 
(i) if the defendant fails to attend that hearing then the defendant may be arrested 
and, if the defendant is on bail, then as well as being arrested may be punished 
and bail may be withdrawn, 
 
(ii) the case may proceed anyway without the court having been able to take 
account of any representations and information that the defendant might want 
to make or give. 
[Note. See section 17ZA of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(a). Under section 17ZA(3) of 
the Act, a magistrates’ court must offer the procedure set out in this rule except in 
circumstances for which Criminal Procedure Rules provide: see section 17ZA(2). 
A defendant will be present at a hearing to which rule 9.14 applies if arrested and brought 
to court in custody. A hearing to which rule 9.14 will apply will have been arranged if a 
defendant is not in custody but has been required to attend court for such a hearing.]

Guilty plea indication by written procedure 
9.11.—(1) This rule— 
(a) applies where— 
 
(i) rule 9.10 applied (Request by written procedure for plea indication), and 
 
(ii) in response to a request under rule 9.10(4)(b) the defendant indicates an 
intention to plead guilty; but 
(b) ceases to apply if the defendant withdraws that plea indication before the court 
completes the procedure under this rule, in which event the court officer must 
arrange a hearing for the purposes of rule 9.14 (Request at a hearing for plea 
indication). 
(2) As soon as practicable after that guilty plea indication the court may decide whether it 
would have been highly likely to commit the defendant to the Crown Court for sentence— 
(a) if that guilty plea indication had constituted a guilty plea; and 
(b) taking into account only such information as is then available to the court. 
(3) Where the court decides that it would have been highly likely to commit the defendant 
to the Crown Court for sentence then as soon as practicable after that decision the court 
officer must give the parties explanations that— 
(a) the court has decided that it would have been highly likely to commit the 
defendant to the Crown Court for sentence if the guilty plea indication had 
constituted a guilty plea; 
(b) if neither party objects then the court will send the defendant to the Crown Court 
for trial in the expectation that the defendant will plead guilty as indicated and will 
be sentenced there; but 
(c) if either party objects within 5 business days then the court will not send the 
defendant to the Crown Court but instead a magistrates’ court trial will be 
arranged. 
(4) Where within 5 business days of giving the explanations required by paragraph (3) 
neither party objects to the court sending the defendant to the Crown Court then rule 9.23 
applies (Sending after allocation for Crown Court trial). 
(5) Paragraph (6) applies where any of the following occurs— 
(a) the court chooses to make no decision whether or not it would have been highly 
likely to commit the defendant to the Crown Court for sentence if the guilty plea 
indication had constituted a guilty plea; 
(b) the court decides that it would not have been highly likely to commit the defendant 
to the Crown Court for sentence; or 
(c) within 5 business days of giving the explanations required by paragraph (3) either 
party objects to the court sending the defendant to the Crown Court. 
(6) Where this paragraph applies— 
(a) the court officer must arrange a hearing for the purposes of Part 24 (Trial and 
sentence in a magistrates’ court); 
(b) if at that hearing the defendant pleads guilty the court must deal with the case in 
accordance with rule 24.11 (Procedure if the court convicts); and 
(c) if at that hearing the defendant pleads not guilty the court must deal with the case 
in accordance with rule 9.16 (Not guilty plea indication at a hearing).

[Note. See sections 17ZA and 17ZB of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(a). Under sections 
17ZA(2) and 17ZB(2), Criminal Procedure Rules may provide for circumstances in which 
the procedure set out in this rule does not apply.] 
Not guilty plea indication by written procedure 
9.12.—(1) This rule— 
(a) applies where— 
 
(i) rule 9.10 applied (Request by written procedure for plea indication), and 
 
(ii) in response to a request under rule 9.10(4)(b) the defendant indicates an 
intention to plead not guilty; but 
(b) ceases to apply if the defendant withdraws that plea indication before the court 
completes the procedure under this rule, in which event the court officer must 
arrange a hearing for the purposes of rule 9.14 (Request at a hearing for plea 
indication). 
(2) As soon as practicable after that not guilty plea indication the court officer must give 
the parties explanations that— 
(a) because the defendant has indicated an intention to plead not guilty the court must 
decide whether the case should be tried in a magistrates’ court or in the Crown 
Court; 
(b) (if applicable) the offence is one to which section 22 of the Magistrates’ Courts 
Act 1980(b) applies (Certain offences triable either way to be tried summarily if 
value involved is small) and for that reason— 
 
(i) the court must first assess the value involved, and the parties will be invited to 
make representations about that value, 
 
(ii) if the court decides that that value clearly is less than £5,000 then the court 
will order trial in a magistrates’ court, and 
 
(iii) if the court decides that the value involved is not clearly less than £5,000, 
before deciding whether the case should be tried in a magistrates’ court or in 
the Crown Court the court will ask whether the defendant wants to be tried in 
the Crown Court; 
(c) (if applicable) the offence is one to which section 22A of the Magistrates’ Courts 
Act 1980(c) may apply (Low-value shoplifting to be a summary offence) and for 
that reason— 
 
(i) the court must first assess the value and circumstances involved, and the 
parties will be invited to make representations about that, 
 
(ii) if the court decides that the offence is low-value shoplifting then the case must 
be tried in a magistrates’ court unless the defendant requires Crown Court trial 
and the court will ask whether the defendant wants to be tried in the Crown 
Court; and 
(d) (in any other case) the court will decide by written procedure whether the case 
should be tried in a magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court unless—

34
 
(i) the defendant requires Crown Court trial, in which case the court must send 
the defendant for such a trial without asking for representations about that 
decision and without offering any indication of likely magistrates’ court 
sentence, or 
 
(ii) the defendant gives notice requiring the court to decide at a hearing whether 
the case should be tried in a magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court, in 
which case a hearing will be arranged for the purposes of rule 9.16 (Not guilty 
plea indication at a hearing).

and the court decides that the value involved clearly is less than £5,000; or 
(b) the court decides that section 22A of the 1980 Act applies (low-value shoplifting) 
and the defendant does not require Crown Court trial. 
(7) Where none of paragraphs (4), (5) or (6) applies the court must decide whether the 
case should be tried in a magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court, taking into account— 
(a) the adequacy of a magistrates’ court’s sentencing powers; 
(b) any representations by the parties, and

[Note. See sections 17ZA, 17ZC, 18, 19 and 22 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(a). 
Under sections 17ZA(2) and 17ZC(2), Criminal Procedure Rules may provide for

Under section 22 of the 1980 Act, some offences, which otherwise could be tried in a 
magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court, must be tried in a magistrates’ court in the 
circumstances described in this rule. 
Under section 22A of the 1980 Act, an offence of theft, which otherwise could be tried in a 
magistrates’ court or in the Crown Court, must be tried in a magistrates’ court as low-
value shoplifting if— 
(a) the value of stolen goods does not exceed £200; 
(b) the goods were being offered for sale in a shop or any other premises, stall, vehicle 
or place from which a trade or business is carried on; and 
(c) at the time of the offence the defendant was, or was purporting to be, a customer 
or potential customer, 
unless the defendant requires Crown Court trial. 
The convictions of which the court may take account are those specified by section 19 of the 
1980 Act. 
The Sentencing Council may issue allocation guidelines under section 122 of the Coroners 
and Justice Act 2009(a). The definitive allocation guideline which took effect on 1st March, 
2016 provides: 
(1) In general, either way offences should be tried summarily unless— 
(a) the outcome would clearly be a sentence in excess of the court’s powers for the 
offence(s) concerned after taking into account personal mitigation and any 
potential reduction for a guilty plea; or 
(b) for reasons of unusual legal, procedural or factual complexity, the case should be 
tried in the Crown Court. This exception may apply in cases where a very 
substantial fine is the likely sentence. Other circumstances where this exception 
will apply are likely to be rare and case specific; the court will rely on the 
submissions of the parties to identify relevant cases. 
(2) In cases with no factual or legal complications the court should bear in mind its 
power to commit for sentence after a trial and may retain jurisdiction notwithstanding that 
the likely sentence might exceed its powers. 
(3) Cases may be tried summarily even where the defendant is subject to a Crown Court 
Suspended Sentence Order or Community Order. 
(4) All parties should be asked by the court to make representations as to whether the 
case is suitable for summary trial. The court should refer to definitive guidelines (if any) to 
assess the likely sentence for the offence in the light of the facts alleged by the prosecution 
case, taking into account all aspects of the case including those advanced by the defence, 
including any personal mitigation to which the defence wish to refer. 
Where the court decides that the case is suitable to be dealt with in the magistrates’ court, 
it must warn the defendant that all sentencing options remain open and, if the defendant 
consents to summary trial and is convicted by the court or pleads guilty, the defendant may 
be committed to the Crown Court for sentence.] 
Allocation by written procedure for magistrates’ court trial 
9.13.—(1) This rule— 
(a) applies where—

Act 2022 (c. 35). 
 
36
 
(i) rule 9.12 applied (Not guilty plea indication by written procedure), and 
 
(ii) under rule 9.12(7) the court decides that the case should be tried in a 
magistrates’ court; but 
(b) ceases to apply if the defendant withdraws the not guilty plea indication before the 
court completes the procedure under this rule, in which event the court officer 
must arrange a hearing for the purposes of rule 9.14 (Request at a hearing for plea 
indication). 
(2) As soon as practicable after the court decides that the case should be tried in a 
magistrates’ court the court officer must give the defendant explanations that— 
(a) the court has decided that the case should be tried in a magistrates’ court; 
(b) if the defendant is convicted at a trial in a magistrates’ court then in some 
circumstances the court may commit the defendant to the Crown Court for 
sentence; 
(c) if the defendant agrees to a magistrates’ court trial then such a trial will be 
arranged; 
(d) if the defendant does not agree to such a trial then the court will send the defendant 
to the Crown Court for trial; 
(e) before deciding whether to agree to a magistrates’ court trial the defendant may 
ask the court for an indication of whether a custodial or non-custodial sentence is 
more likely in the event of a guilty plea at such a trial (“a sentencing indication”) 
but the court need not give such an indication; and 
(f) if the defendant asks for and the court gives a sentencing indication then a 
magistrates’ court trial will be arranged if the defendant then either— 
 
(i) indicates an intention to plead guilty instead of not guilty, or 
 
(ii) without changing the not guilty plea indication agrees to magistrates’ court 
trial. 
(3) At the same time as giving the explanations required by paragraph (2) the court officer 
must request that not more than 5 business days later the defendant either— 
(a) agrees to trial in a magistrates’ court; or 
(b) asks for a sentencing indication. 
(4) If within 5 business days of the request under paragraph (3) the defendant asks for a 
sentencing indication—

if so in what terms; 
(b) as soon as practicable after the court makes those decisions the court officer must 
notify the defendant accordingly; and 
(c) at the same time as notifying the defendant of the court’s decisions the court 
officer must request that not more than 3 business days later the defendant either— 
 
(i) gives a guilty plea indication, or 
 
(ii) without giving such an indication agrees to trial in a magistrates’ court. 
(5) If within the time allowed under paragraph (3) or paragraph (4) the defendant gives a 
guilty plea indication or agrees to trial in a magistrates’ court— 
(a) the court must give such directions, if any, as are required for an effective trial and 
may require further information from the parties for that purpose;

The Sentencing Council may issue allocation guidelines under section 122 of the Coroners 
and Justice Act 2009(a). The definitive allocation guideline which took effect on 1st March, 
2016 provides: 
(1) In general, either way offences should be tried summarily unless— 
(a) the outcome would clearly be a sentence in excess of the court’s powers for the 
offence(s) concerned after taking into account personal mitigation and any 
potential reduction for a guilty plea; or 
(b) for reasons of unusual legal, procedural or factual complexity, the case should be 
tried in the Crown Court. This exception may apply in cases where a very 
substantial fine is the likely sentence. Other circumstances where this exception 
will apply are likely to be rare and case specific; the court will rely on the 
submissions of the parties to identify relevant cases. 
(2) In cases with no factual or legal complications the court should bear in mind its 
power to commit for sentence after a trial and may retain jurisdiction notwithstanding that 
the likely sentence might exceed its powers. 
(3) Cases may be tried summarily even where the defendant is subject to a Crown Court 
Suspended Sentence Order or Community Order. 
(4) All parties should be asked by the court to make representations as to whether the 
case is suitable for summary trial. The court should refer to definitive guidelines (if any) to 
assess the likely sentence for the offence in the light of the facts alleged by the prosecution 
case, taking into account all aspects of the case including those advanced by the defence, 
including any personal mitigation to which the defence wish to refer. 
Where the court decides that the case is suitable to be dealt with in the magistrates’ court, 
it must warn the defendant that all sentencing options remain open and, if the defendant 
consents to summary trial and is convicted by the court or pleads guilty, the defendant may 
be committed to the Crown Court for sentence. 
Where the court orders trial in a magistrates’ court, see also rules 3.16 to 3.18 about 
preparation for trial.] 
Allocation at a hearing for magistrates’ court trial 
9.17.—(1) This rule applies at a hearing where— 
(a) rule 9.16 applies; and 
(b) under rule 9.16(5)(e) the court decides that the case should be tried in a 
magistrates’ court. 
(2) The court must explain, in terms the defendant can understand (with help, if 
necessary) that— 
(a) the court has decided that the case should be tried in a magistrates’ court; 
(b) if the defendant is convicted at a trial in a magistrates’ court then in some 
circumstances the court may commit the defendant to the Crown Court for 
sentence; 
(c) if the defendant agrees to a magistrates’ court trial then such a trial will be 
arranged; 
(d) if the defendant does not agree to such a trial then the court will send the defendant 
to the Crown Court for trial; and 
(e) before deciding whether to agree to a magistrates’ court trial the defendant may 
ask the court for an indication of whether a custodial or non-custodial sentence is 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 2009 c. 25; section 122 was amended by section 51 of, and paragraph 13 of Schedule 2 to, the Judicial Review and Courts 
Act 2022 (c. 35). 
 
42
more likely in the event of a guilty plea at such a trial (“a sentencing indication”) 
but the court need not give such an indication. 
(3) If the defendant asks for a sentencing indication and the court gives such an 
indication— 
(a) the court must then ask again whether the defendant intends to plead guilty; 
(b) if, in answer to that question, the defendant indicates an intention to plead guilty 
then the court must deal with the case— 
 
(i) as if the defendant had just pleaded guilty to an offence that can be tried only 
in a magistrates’ court, and 
 
(ii) in accordance with rule 24.11 (Procedure if the court convicts); and 
(c) if, in answer to that question, the defendant indicates an intention to plead not 
guilty, or gives no indication of intended plea, in the following sequence the court 
must then— 
 
(i) ask whether the defendant agrees to trial in a magistrates’ court, 
 
(ii) if the defendant’s answer to that question is ‘yes’, order such a trial, and 
 
(iii) if the defendant does not answer that question, or the answer is ‘no’, then rule 
9.23 applies (Sending after allocation for Crown Court trial). 
(4) If the defendant asks for a sentencing indication but the court gives none, or if the 
defendant does not ask for such an indication, in the following sequence the court must 
then— 
(a) ask whether the defendant agrees to trial in a magistrates’ court; 
(b) if the defendant’s answer to that question is ‘yes’, order such a trial; and 
(c) if the defendant does not answer that question, or the answer is ‘no’, then rule 9.23 
applies (Sending after allocation for Crown Court trial). 
(5) Where neither the defendant nor the defendant’s legal representative is present when 
this rule applies— 
(a) paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) do not apply; 
(b) the court must order trial in a magistrates’ court; but 
(c) the court may direct a fresh hearing under this rule if— 
 
(i) before pleading guilty or not guilty at that trial the defendant asks for such a 
fresh hearing and gives an explanation for the absence, and 
 
(ii) the court thinks it in the interests of justice so to direct, having regard to that 
explanation.

the court officer must arrange a hearing for the purposes of rule 9.21 (Allocation at 
a hearing for youth court or Crown Court trial). 
(2) The court officer must serve on the parties— 
(a) notice— 
 
(i) that the court will consider the offence or offences of which the defendant is 
accused on a date and at a time and place specified in the notice, with a 
statement of each offence, and 
 
(ii) advising the defendant to consult a legal representative and giving information 
about how to find a representative if the defendant does not already have one; 
(b) explanations that— 
 
(i) because the court must decide whether the defendant’s case should be tried in 
the Crown Court instead of in a youth court a hearing for that purpose has 
been arranged, 
 
(ii) instead of attending that hearing the parties may make written representations 
about whether the court should order trial in a youth court or send the 
defendant for Crown Court trial, 
 
(iii) instead of attending that hearing the defendant may give a written plea 
indication, guilty or not guilty, to each offence of which the defendant is 
accused, 
 
(iv) only legal representatives have access to the electronic arrangements needed 
to make written representations or give a written plea indication, and 
 
(v) if the defendant uses those electronic arrangements to respond then the court 
officer will provide more information about the procedure; and 
(c) a warning that if the defendant does not respond using those electronic 
arrangements by a date specified in the notice then the hearing to which the notice 
refers will take place and— 
 
(i) if the defendant fails to attend that hearing then the defendant may be arrested 
and, if the defendant is on bail, then as well as being arrested may be punished 
and bail may be withdrawn, 
 
(ii) the case may proceed anyway without the court having been able to take 
account of any representations and information that the defendant might want 
to make or give. 
(3) The date specified under paragraph (2)(c) must be not less than 8 business days after 
service of the notice, explanations and warning required by paragraph (2). 
(4) If by the date specified under paragraph (2)(c) the defendant uses the electronic 
arrangements to which that paragraph refers then the court officer must give the defendant 
by those means— 
(a) explanations that— 
 
(i) a plea indication does not of itself constitute a plea, there will be a court 
hearing for the defendant to confirm that plea, and the defendant will be able 
to withdraw the plea indication before the case is sent for trial or the plea is 
taken in court, 
 
(ii) before giving a plea indication the defendant may ask the court for an 
indication of whether a custodial or non-custodial sentence is more likely in 
the event of a guilty plea at a trial in a youth court (“a sentencing indication”) 
but the court need not give such an indication, 
 
(iii) if the defendant indicates an intention to plead guilty then the court officer 
will arrange a hearing at which the plea will be taken in court, and if the 
defendant then pleads guilty the court will pass sentence or commit the 
defendant for sentence to the Crown Court, 
 
45
 
(iv) if the defendant indicates an intention to plead not guilty and the court then, 
without a hearing, sends the defendant for trial in the Crown Court it will be 
on bail, which will be without conditions if the defendant is already on 
unconditional bail or is not on bail at all, or will be subject to the same 
conditions if the defendant is already on conditional bail, 
 
(v) if the defendant is sent for trial on bail, failure to attend at the Crown Court 
when required is an offence for which the defendant may be arrested and 
punished and bail may be withdrawn, and 
 
(vi) if the defendant gives a plea indication then the court officer will provide 
more information about the procedure and will ask for more information from 
the defendant; 
(b) a request that the defendant gives a plea indication or asks for a sentencing 
indication; and 
(c) a warning that if the defendant gives a plea indication but later withdraws it the 
hearing to which the paragraph (2) notice refers will take place and— 
 
(i) if the defendant fails to attend that hearing then the defendant may be arrested 
and, if the defendant is on bail, then as well as being arrested may be punished 
and bail may be withdrawn, 
 
(ii) the case may proceed anyway without the court having been able to take 
account of any representations and information that the defendant might want 
to make or give. 
(5) If in response to the request under paragraph (4) the defendant asks for a sentencing 
indication— 
(a) the court must as soon as practicable decide whether to give such an indication, 
and if so in what terms; and 
(b) as soon as practicable after the court makes those decisions, the court officer 
must— 
 
(i) notify the defendant accordingly, and 
 
(ii) request that the defendant gives a plea indication not more than 3 business 
days later. 
(6) If by the date specified under paragraph (2)(c) or within the time allowed under 
paragraph (5) the defendant indicates an intention to plead guilty then— 
(a) the court officer must arrange a hearing for the purposes of Part 24 (Trial and 
sentence in a magistrates’ court); 
(b) if at that hearing the defendant pleads guilty the court must deal with the case in 
accordance with rule 24.11 (Procedure if the court convicts); and 
(c) if at that hearing the defendant pleads not guilty the court must deal with the case 
in accordance with rule 9.21(7) (procedure where defendant pleads not guilty 
under that rule). 
(7) If by the date specified under paragraph (2)(c) or within the time allowed under 
paragraph (5) the defendant indicates an intention to plead not guilty then— 
(a) the court officer must request that not more than 5 business days later the parties 
should make representations about whether the court should send the defendant for 
Crown Court trial instead of ordering trial in a youth court; and 
(b) no sooner than the earlier of the receipt from both parties of responses to that 
request or the expiry of 5 business days the court must consider any response and 
must decide whether the case should be tried in a youth court or in the Crown 
Court, taking into account— 
 
(i) any representations by the parties, and 
 
(ii) any guidelines affecting the court’s decision issued by the Sentencing 
Council. 
 
46
(8) If the court decides that the case should be tried in a youth court— 
(a) the court must give such directions as are required for an effective trial and may 
require further information from the parties for that purpose; and 
(b) the court officer must arrange a hearing for the purposes of Part 24 (Trial and 
sentence in a magistrates’ court). 
(9) If the court decides that the case should be tried in the Crown Court then rule 9.23 
applies (Sending after allocation for Crown Court trial). 
[Note. See sections 24ZA and 24ZB of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(a) and section 51A 
of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998(b). Under section 24ZA(3) of the 1980 Act, a 
magistrates’ court must offer the procedure set out in this rule except in circumstances for 
which Criminal Procedure Rules provide: see section 24ZA(2). 
A defendant will be present at a hearing to which rule 9.21 applies if arrested and brought 
to court in custody. A hearing to which rule 9.21 will apply will have been arranged if a 
defendant is not in custody but has been required to attend court for such a hearing. 
The Sentencing Council may issue sentencing guidelines under section 120 of the Coroners 
and Justice Act 2009(c). The definitive guideline on sentencing children and young people 
which took effect on 1st June, 2017, in Section two: Allocation provides, “Subject to the 
exceptions noted below, cases involving children and young people should be tried in the 
youth court. It is the court which is best designed to meet their specific needs. A trial in the 
Crown Court with the inevitably greater formality and greatly increased number of people 
involved (including a jury and the public) should be reserved for the most serious cases.” 
The guideline includes further detailed guidance. 
For the circumstances in which a magistrates’ court may (and, in some cases, must) commit 
a defendant who is under 18 to the Crown Court for sentence after that defendant has 
indicated a guilty plea, see sections 16, 16A, 17, 19 and 20 of the Sentencing Act 2020(d). 
Where the court orders trial in a youth court, see also rules 3.16 to 3.18 about preparation 
for trial. 
In the circumstances for which this rule provides section 34A of the Children and Young 
Persons Act 1933(e) allows, and in some circumstances requires, the court to ensure that a 
parent or guardian is aware of the proceedings.] 
Young defendant becoming an adult during written procedure 
9.20.—(1) This rule applies where the defendant becomes 18 before the court completes 
the procedure under rule 9.19 (Allocation by written procedure for youth court or Crown 
Court trial). 
(2) Instead of that procedure— 
(a) where the defendant becomes 18 without having indicated an intention to plead 
guilty or not guilty under rule 9.19(6) and before the time for such an indication 
expires then the request for that indication constitutes a request under rule 9.10

effect from a date to be appointed. 
(b) 1998 c. 37; section 51A was inserted by paragraphs 15 and 18 of Schedule 3 to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44) and 
amended by section 49 of, and paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to, the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 (c. 38), paragraph 6 of 
Schedule 21 to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (c. 10), and paragraph 156 of Schedule 24 
to the Sentencing Act 2020 (c. 17). It is further amended by section 10 of the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (c. 35) 
with effect from a date to be appointed. 
(c) 2009 c. 25; section 120 was amended by section 416 of, and paragraph 277 of Schedule 24 to, the Sentencing Act 2020 (c. 
17). 
(d) 2020 c. 17; section 16A was inserted, and sections 17 and 19 amended, by section 50 of, and paragraph 26 of Schedule 13 
to, the Counter-Terrorism and Sentencing Act 2021 (c. 11).

(request by written procedure for plea indication by an adult) and rules 9.11 to 9.13 
apply accordingly (the rules about written procedures in respect of an adult 
defendant); 
(b) where the defendant becomes 18 after indicating an intention to plead guilty or not 
guilty under rule 9.19(6) but before the court decides whether the case should be 
tried in a youth court or in the Crown Court and before the defendant enters a plea 
at a hearing then paragraph (3) applies; 
(c) where the defendant becomes 18 without having indicated an intention to plead 
guilty or not guilty under rule 9.19(6), after the time for such an indication expires 
and before the hearing under rule 9.21 (Allocation at a hearing for youth court or 
Crown Court trial), then that hearing constitutes a hearing under rule 9.14 (request 
at a hearing for plea indication by an adult); and 
(d) where the defendant becomes 18 after withdrawing a notice of intention to plead 
guilty or not guilty under rule 9.19(6) but before the hearing under rule 9.21 then 
paragraph (3) applies. 
(3) Where this paragraph applies (plea indication but no allocation yet, or withdrawal of 
plea indication)— 
(a) the court must decide whether to continue as if the defendant were still under 18, 
taking into account— 
 
(i) any representations by the parties, and 
 
(ii) any guidelines affecting the court’s decision issued by the Sentencing 
Council; 
(b) if the court decides not to continue as if the defendant were still under 18 where 
the offence is one for which an adult defendant must be tried in the Crown Court 
(an offence triable only on indictment) then rule 9.8 applies (Sending by written 
procedure for Crown Court trial); and 
(c) if the court decides not to continue as if the defendant were still under 18 where 
the offence is one for which an adult defendant can be tried in a magistrates’ court 
or the Crown Court (an offence triable either way)— 
 
(i) rule 9.11(6) or rule 9.12 applies accordingly (the rules about written 
indications by an adult defendant of intention to plead guilty or not guilty), 
and 
 
(ii) a hearing under rule 9.21 constitutes a hearing under rule 9.14 (request at a 
hearing for plea indication by an adult). 
[Note. See section 24ZB of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 and section 47 of the Crime 
and Disorder Act 1998(a). 
See also the note to rule 9.19 (Allocation by written procedure for youth court or Crown 
Court trial).] 
Allocation at a hearing for youth court or Crown Court trial 
9.21.—(1) This rule applies at a hearing where— 
(a) the defendant is under 18 and 
(b) the court must decide whether to send the defendant for Crown Court trial instead 
of ordering trial in a youth court. 
(2) The court must read the allegation of the offence to the defendant. 
                                                                                                                                            
(a) 1998 c. 37; section 47 was amended by sections 165 and 168 of, and Part I of Schedule 12 to, the Powers of Criminal 
Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 (c. 6), section 336 of, and Part 4 of Schedule 37 to, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44) and 
article 2 of, and paragraph 59 of the Schedule to, S.I. 2005/886. It is further amended by section 12 of the Judicial Review 
and Courts Act 2022 (c. 35) with effect from a date to be appointed. 
 
48
(3) The court must explain, in terms the defendant can understand (with help, if 
necessary)— 
(a) the allegation, unless it is self-explanatory; 
(b) that the offence is one which can be tried in the Crown Court instead of in a youth 
court; 
(c) that the court is about to ask whether the defendant intends to plead guilty; 
(d) that if the answer is ‘yes’, then the court must treat that as a guilty plea and must 
sentence the defendant, or commit the defendant to the Crown Court for sentence; 
(e) that if the defendant does not answer, or the answer is ‘no’, then the court must 
decide whether to send the defendant for Crown Court trial instead of ordering trial 
in a youth court; 
(f) that before answering and at any time until the court decides whether to send the 
defendant for Crown Court trial or order trial in a youth court— 
 
(i) the defendant may ask the court for an indication of whether a custodial or 
non-custodial sentence is more likely in the event of a guilty plea there and 
then, but 
 
(ii) the court need not give such an indication; and 
(g) that reporting restrictions apply, which the defendant may ask the court to vary or 
remove. 
(4) The defendant may then ask the court for such an indication of sentence. 
(5) Whether the defendant asks for and the court gives such an indication or not, the court 
must then ask whether the defendant intends to plead guilty. 
(6) If the defendant’s answer to that question is ‘yes’, the court must deal with the case— 
(a) as if the defendant had just pleaded guilty at a trial in a youth court; and 
(b) in accordance with rule 24.11 (Procedure if the court convicts). 
(7) If the defendant does not answer that question, or the answer is ‘no’, in the following 
sequence the court must then— 
(a) invite the prosecutor to make representations about whether the court should send 
the defendant for Crown Court trial instead of ordering trial in a youth court; 
(b) invite the defendant to make such representations; and 
(c) decide whether the case should be tried in a youth court or in the Crown Court, 
taking into account— 
 
(i) any representations by the parties, and 
 
(ii) any guidelines affecting the court’s decision issued by the Sentencing 
Council. 
(8) If the court decides that the case should be tried in a youth court— 
(a) the court must give such directions as are required for an effective trial and may 
require further information from the parties for that purpose; and 
(b) the court officer must arrange a hearing for the purposes of Part 24 (Trial and 
sentence in a magistrates’ court). 
(9) If the court decides that the case should be tried in the Crown Court then rule 9.23 
applies (Sending after allocation for Crown Court trial). 
(10) Where the court decides to exercise the powers to which this rule applies in the 
defendant’s absence— 
(a) paragraphs (2) to (6) and (7)(b) do not apply; and 
(b) the rest of paragraph (7) and paragraphs (8) and (9) apply as if the defendant were 
present and had indicated an intention to plead not guilty.

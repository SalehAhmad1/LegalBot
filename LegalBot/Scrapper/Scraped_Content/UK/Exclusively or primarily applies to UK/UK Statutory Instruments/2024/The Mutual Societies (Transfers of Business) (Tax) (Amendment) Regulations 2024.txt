23rd April 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Mutual Societies (Transfers of Business) (Tax) Regulations 2009 (“the principal Regulations”) which make provision for and in connection with the tax consequences of a transfer of the business or engagements of a mutual society. The amendments made by these Regulations apply the provisions of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 in relation to carried forward trading losses on a transfer of business between building societies.
Regulation 1 provides for citation, commencement and effect. Authority for the limited retrospective effect of these Regulations is given by section 124(5) of the Finance Act 2009. Paragraphs (3) to (6) of regulation 1 ensure that any retrospective effect will be relieving only.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 4 of the principal Regulations to apply Chapter 2E of Part 14 and Chapter 1 of Part 22 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 with modifications to relevant transfers (as defined in the principal Regulations) made by a building society.

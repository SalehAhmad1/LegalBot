(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Registration of Births, Deaths, Marriages and Civil Partnerships (Fees) Regulations 2016 (“the Fees Regulations”) and the Births, Deaths, Marriages and Civil Partnerships Records Regulations 2016 (“the Records Regulations”).
Regulations 2 to 6 amend the Fees Regulations. The amounts of all fees are increased. Rows 51 and 52 of the table in Schedule 1 to the Fees Regulations have been amended to reflect changes to services for electronic copies of register entries. Omissions in the definition of “relevant information”, in regulation 2, and in the table in Schedule 1 to the Fees Regulations have been corrected. These Regulations are being issued free of charge to all known recipients of the Fees Regulations.
Regulation 7 amends the Records Regulations, removing the “expedited service”, the “standard service” and related definitions and omitting regulation 5.
Regulations 8 and 9 make transitional provision. Where a service in Schedule 1 to the Fees Regulations was applied for, requested or otherwise triggered before 28th May 2024, the fee payable will be the fee which was payable immediately before 28th May 2024.
So far as the provision made by this instrument is within the scope of policy relating to the publication of impact assessments, no impact assessment has been produced because no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

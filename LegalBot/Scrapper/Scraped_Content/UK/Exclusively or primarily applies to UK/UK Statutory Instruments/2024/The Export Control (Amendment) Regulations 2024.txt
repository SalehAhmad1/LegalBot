Technical Notes:
For the purposes of PL9013.a.4.,
1. ‘Total Processing Performance’ (‘TPP’) is the bit length per operation multiplied by the processing performance measured in Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) over all processor units on the integrated circuit. For example, the ‘TPP’ for an integrated circuit having two digital processor units that are each capable of 200 TOPS at 16 bits is 6400 (2 processors × 200 TOPS × 16 bits = 6400). In PL9013.a.4.c., the ‘TPP’ of each analogue ‘primitive computational unit’ is the processing performance expressed in TOPS multiplied by 8.
2. A ‘primitive computational unit’ is defined as containing zero or more modifiable weights, receiving one or more inputs, and producing one or more outputs. A computational unit is said to perform 2N-1 operations whenever an output is updated based on N inputs, where each modifiable weight contained in the processing element counts as an input. Each input, weight, and output might be an analogue signal level or a scalar digital value represented using one or more bits. Such units include:
- Artificial neurons
- Multiply accumulate (MAC) units
- Floating-Point Units (FPUs)
- Analogue multiplier units
- Processing units using memristors, spintronics, or magnonics
- Processing units using photonics or non-linear optics
- Processing units using analogue or multi-level non-volatile weights
- Multi-value or multi-level units
- Spiking units
3. Operations relevant to the calculation of TOPS include both scalar operations and the scalar constituents of composite operations such as vector operations, matrix operations, and tensor operations. Scalar operations include integer operations, floating-point operations (often measured by FLOPS), fixed-point operations, bit-manipulation operations and/or bitwise operations.
4. The rate of TOPS is the maximum value theoretically possible when all processing units are operating simultaneously. The rate of TOPS and aggregate bidirectional transfer rate is assumed to be the highest value the manufacturer claims in a manual or brochure for the chip.
5. The bit length of an operation is equal to the highest bit length of any input or output of that operation. Additionally, if the processor unit is designed for operations that achieve different bits × TOPS values, the highest bits × TOPS value should be used.
6. For processing units that provide processing of both sparse and dense matrices, the TOPS values are the values for processing of dense matrices (e.g., without sparsity).
N.B.: For “digital computers” and “electronic assemblies” containing integrated circuits specified in PL9013.a.4., see PL9014.a.2
5. Parametric signal amplifiers having all of the following:

For the purposes of 1A007.b., the detonators of concern all utilise a small electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporises when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. In non-slapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator.”.

7th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Export Control Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/3231) (“the 2008 Order”) and Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items (Recast) (EUR 2009/428) (“the assimilated Dual-Use Regulation”).
Regulation 2 amends Schedule 2 to the 2008 Order, updating controls lists to reflect amendments to the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List. Regulation 2 also amends Schedule 3 to the 2008 Order, introducing new controls on certain specific emerging technology that the UK is implementing alongside a number of other like-minded countries, in order to strengthen the national controls and address weaknesses in the multilateral system.
Regulation 3 amends Annex I to the assimilated Dual-Use Regulation, which lists dual-use goods, software and technology subject to export controls. These amendments reflect changes to the Wassenaar Arrangement dual-use list as well as changes to the control lists administered by other multilateral export control regimes, including the Australia Group, Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime, in line with UK’s commitments as a member of these regimes.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is available from the Export Control Joint Unit, Old Admiralty Building, London SW1A 2DY. The Explanatory Memorandum has also been published alongside the instrument on the www.legislation.gov.uk website, and a copy has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

Disposable capital test
3.  A party satisfies the disposable capital test—
(a)
if they or their partner are aged 66 or over and the party’s disposal capital is less than £16,000;

Disposable capital: general
4.  Disposable capital is the value of any savings and investments belonging to the party on the date on which the application for remission is made, unless any savings and investments are treated as income under this Schedule or are excluded disposable capital.
Disposable capital: non-monetary savings and investments

7.  Where disposable capital is held in currency other than sterling, the cost of any banking charge or commission that would be payable if that amount were converted into sterling is deducted from its value.
Disposable capital: jointly owned savings and investments
8.  Where any savings and investments are owned jointly or in common, there is a presumption that the savings and investments are owned in equal shares, unless evidence to the contrary is produced.
Excluded disposable capital
9.  The following are excluded disposable capital—

Gross monthly income test
10.—(1) If a party satisfies the disposable capital test, no fee is payable under this Order if, at the time when the fee would otherwise be payable—
(a)
the party’s gross monthly income does not exceed the applicable threshold specified in sub-paragraph (2); or
(b)
the party is in receipt of any passporting benefits specified in sub-paragraph (7).
(2) The applicable threshold is—
(a)
£1,420, for a party that is single and has no children;
(b)
£2,130, for a party that is part of a couple and has no children; or
(c)
as otherwise calculated in accordance with sub-paragraph (3).
(3) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the applicable threshold is calculated by taking the following steps—
Step 1
Identify the number of children aged 13 or below and multiply this number by £425.
Step 2
Identify the number of children aged 14 or over and multiply this number by £710.
Step 3
Add together the amounts calculated at Step 1 and Step 2.
Step 4
Add £1,420 to the amount calculated at Step 3.
The result is the applicable threshold for a party that is single and has children.
Step 5
If a party is part of a couple, take this additional step.
Add £710 to the amount calculated at Step 4.
The result is the applicable threshold for a party that is part of a couple and has children.
(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (6), if a party’s gross monthly income exceeds the applicable threshold, that party must pay an amount towards the fee payable to which the application for remission relates, which is determined in accordance with sub-paragraph (5).
(5) Where this sub-paragraph applies, the amount payable is determined as follows—
Step 1
Deduct the applicable threshold from the party’s gross monthly income.
The amount calculated is the “excess income”.
Step 2
Apply the rates specified in the second column of the Table to the parts of the party’s
excess income specified in the corresponding row of the first column.
Step 3
Add together the amounts calculated at Step 2 (if there are two or more such amounts).
Subject to sub-paragraph (6), the result is the amount payable.
Table
Part of excess income Rate
Up to and including £1,000 50%
£1,001 to £2,000 70%

(b)

11.  No remission is available if a party’s gross monthly income exceeds the applicable threshold determined in accordance with paragraph 10(2), plus the sum of £3,000.
Gross monthly income
12.—(1) “Gross monthly income” means the total sum of—
(a)
the lower of—
(i)
the gross amount that has been earned by the party in the month immediately preceding that in which the application for remission is made; or
(ii)
the average of the gross amount that has been earned by the party in the three months immediately preceding that in which the application for remission is made, and
(b)
the gross amount received by the party from any other source in the month immediately preceding that in which the application for remission is made, other than receipt of any excluded benefits.
(2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), earnings from a trade, business or gainful occupation other than an occupation at a wage or salary are calculated as the lower of—
(a)
the party’s net profits for the month preceding that in which the application for remission is made; or
(b)
the average of the party’s net profits for the three months preceding that in which the application for remission is made.
(3) In sub-paragraph (2), “net profits” means the profits which have accrued to the party less all sums necessarily expended to earn those profits.
Disposable capital and gross monthly income of a partner
13.—(1) The disposable capital and gross monthly income of a partner of a party is to be treated as disposable capital and gross monthly income of the party, subject to sub-paragraph (2).
(2) Where the partner of a party has a contrary interest to the party in the matter to which the fee relates, the disposable capital and gross monthly income of that partner, if any, is not treated as the disposable capital and gross monthly income of the party.
Application for remission of a fee
14.—(1) An application for remission of a fee must be made at the time when the fee would otherwise be payable.
(2) Where an application for remission of a fee is made, the party must—
(a)
indicate the fee to which the application relates;
(b)
declare the amount of their disposable capital; and
(c)
provide documentary evidence of their gross monthly income and the number of children relevant for the purposes of paragraph 10.
(3) Where an application for remission of a fee is made on the date on which a fee is payable, the date for payment of the fee is disapplied.
(4) Where an application for remission is refused, or if part remission of a fee is granted, the amount of the fee which remains unremitted must be paid within the period notified in writing to the party.
(5) The Chief Executive of the Supreme Court may, by written notice, request such additional information or evidence as is required to assess the party’s entitlement to fee remission under this Order, and the period specified by such notice must not be less than 7 days, beginning with the day after the date on which the notice is sent.
(6) An application for remission of a fee may be treated as abandoned and no further action taken, if a party fails to provide the information requested under sub-paragraph (5) within the period specified by that notice, or such other extended period as may be agreed in writing at the Chief Executive of the Supreme Court’s discretion.
Remission in exceptional circumstances
15.  A fee specified in this Order may be remitted where the Chief Executive of the Supreme Court is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances which justify doing so.
Remission for charitable or not-for-profit organisations
16.  Where an application for permission to intervene in an appeal is filed by a charitable or not- for-profit organisation which seeks to make submissions in the public interest, the Chief Executive of the Supreme Court may remit the fee in that case.
Refunds
17.—(1) Where a party pays a fee at a time when that party would have been entitled to a remission if they had provided the documentary evidence required by paragraph 14, the fee, or the amount by which the fee would have been remitted as the case may be, must be refunded if documentary evidence relating to the time when the fee became payable is provided at a later date.
(2) Where a fee has been paid at a time when the Chief Executive of the Supreme Court, if all the circumstances had been known, would have remitted the fee under paragraph 15, the fee or the amount by which the fee would have been remitted, as the case may be, must be refunded to the party.
(3) No refund may be made under this paragraph unless the party who paid the fee applies within 3 months of the date on which the fee was paid.
(4) The Chief Executive of the Supreme Court may extend the period of 3 months mentioned in sub-paragraph (3) if the Chief Executive of the Supreme Court considers that there is a good reason for a refund being made after the end of the period of 3 months.

(This note is not part of the Order)
The Supreme Court Fees Order 2009 (S.I. 2009/2131 (L. 25)) (“the 2009 Order”) specified the fees payable in the Supreme Court. This Order consolidates the 2009 Order and its amending instruments and increases the fees payable to account for historic inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI).
The fees in column (2) of the table in paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 are payable in relation to the items described in column (1). Where the matter relates to criminal proceedings, the only fee payable is the fee for submitting a claim for costs.
As part of the consolidation—
(a)
the separate fee rates that applied in the 2009 Order between civil cases and devolution jurisdiction cases have been removed. The fees payable for devolution jurisdiction cases and civil cases are now the same;
(b)
fees 2.5 and 4.2 specified in the table in Schedule 1 to the 2009 Order (and summarised in the table below) have been combined with other fees in this Order to reduce the number of fees payable at different stages of proceedings;
(c)
fee 2.3 specified in the table in paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 to this Order applies to the filing of either a reference under—
(i)
the Supreme Court’s devolution jurisdiction (relating to proceedings under the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46), the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32) or the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (c. 47)); or
(ii)
section 6A or 6B of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in relation to assimilated case law (previously known as retained EU case law before 31st December 2023).

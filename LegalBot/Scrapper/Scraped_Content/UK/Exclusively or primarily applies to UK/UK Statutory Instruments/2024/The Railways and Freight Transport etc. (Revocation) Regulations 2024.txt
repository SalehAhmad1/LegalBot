(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke, in their entirety, 24 instruments which are secondary assimilated law for Great Britain, which primarily make provision about the operation of railways and freight transport arrangements. All of the instruments being revoked are secondary assimilated law within the meaning of section 21(1) of that Act (see also section 14(10) of that Act).
The instruments being revoked have become obsolete for various reasons, and they no longer produce any legal effect in Great Britain. The instruments listed in the Schedule consist of:
(a)
instruments which make provision for expired contingency arrangements: (EUR 2019/503, EUR 2020/2222, EUR 2020/698, and EUDN 2020/1237). These were time-limited responses to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU or the COVID-19 pandemic;
(b)
instruments which make provision for cross-border and freight arrangements between the UK and EU which are no longer operable: (EUR 2015/429, EUDN 2018/491, EUR 2020/1056, and EUDN 2020/2228). These pertain to EU systems or platforms that the UK no longer has access to, or only apply to EU member states;
(c)
instruments which make provision for past EU negotiating positions or for the accession to or adoption of international protocols on behalf of the EU and European Community.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside this instrument at www.legislation.gov.uk.

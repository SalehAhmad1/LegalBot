27 June 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 6 (meaning of “public body”) of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 (“the Act”) lists certain persons as being a “public body” for the purposes of Part 2 (improving well-being) and Part 3 (the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales) of the Act.
These Regulations add eight additional persons (“the additional public bodies”) to the list of public bodies in section 6 of the Act: Welsh Ambulance Services University NHS Trust; Digital Health and Care Wales; Health Education and Improvement Wales; Social Care Wales; Welsh Revenue Authority; Transport for Wales (company number 09476013); Centre for Digital Public Services Limited (company number 09341679) and Qualifications Wales. This means that the additional public bodies will be liable to comply with Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.
Regulation 3 makes provision in relation to section 9 (other public bodies’ well-being objectives) of the Act, to specify that the additional public bodies must set and publish well-being objectives by 31 March 2025.
Regulation 4 makes provision in relation to section 15 (the sustainable development principle: Auditor General’s examinations) of the Act, which defines the reporting period for examinations by the Auditor General for Wales (“AGW”). Under section 15 of the Act, the AGW reporting period begins on the date falling one year before the date on which an ordinary general election is to be held under section 3 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 and ends on the date falling one day and one year before the date on which the next such election is to be held. Due to the additional bodies being added to the Act on 30 June 2024 and being required to set well-being objectives by 31 March 2025, this regulation amends the first AGW reporting period in relation to the additional public bodies, meaning that the AGW will be required to report on the additional public bodies from 30 June 2024 to the end of the next reporting period, set under section 15(6)(b). The additional public bodies will subsequently be subject to the reporting period under section 15(6) of the Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared and a copy can be obtained from the Sustainable Futures Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ or Sustainable.Futures@gov.wales.

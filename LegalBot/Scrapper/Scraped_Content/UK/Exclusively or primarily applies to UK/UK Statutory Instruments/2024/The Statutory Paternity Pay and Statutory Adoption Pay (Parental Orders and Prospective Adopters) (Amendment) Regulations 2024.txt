(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations correct drafting errors in the amendments that were made to the Statutory Paternity Pay and Statutory Adoption Pay (Parental Orders and Prospective Adopters) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”) by the Statutory Paternity Pay (Amendment) Regulations 2024.
The 2014 Regulations apply, with modifications, the Statutory Paternity Pay and Statutory Adoption Pay (General) Regulations 2002 to ‘parental order parents’ (those who have applied or intend to apply for a parental order under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008).
Regulation 4 amends regulation 11 of the 2014 Regulations so that a parental order parent may choose for statutory paternity pay (adoption) to be paid in respect of two non-consecutive weeks or in respect of a single period of one or two weeks.
Regulation 5 amends regulation 14 of the 2014 Regulations to provide the timescales for giving notice stating the week or weeks in respect of which payments of statutory paternity pay (adoption) are to be made and the timescales for varying that notice.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

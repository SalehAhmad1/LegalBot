SCHEDULE 9
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS AND IMPOSITION OF NEW RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land are to apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph 2(2).
(2) For section 5A (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act, after “if” substitute—
“(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 9 to the Medworth Energy from Waste Combined Heat and Power Order 2024;
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 9 to the Medworth Energy from Waste Combined Heat and Power Order 2024) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land where it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 30 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 23 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right under article 25 (compulsory acquisition of rights and imposition of restrictive covenants)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (refusal to convey, failure to make title etc.);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (persons without power to sell their interests);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified to secure that, as from the date on which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restriction, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applied to compulsory acquisition under article 23 (compulsory acquisition of land)), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12 (unauthorised entry) and 13 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 30(7) (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965) is so modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, or enforce the restriction imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A (counter–notice requiring purchase of land not in notice to treat) to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 (execution of declaration) of the 1981 Act as applied by article 29 (application of the 1981 Act) of the Medworth Energy from Waste Combined Heat and Power Facility Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 26 (acquisition of subsoil only) of the Medworth Energy from Waste Combined Heat and Power Facility Order 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of twenty-eight days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of three months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.

(b)
a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986(4);
(c)
a water undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991; and
(d)
a sewerage undertaker within the meaning of Part 1 of the Water Industry Act 1991,
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained.
3.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
4.  Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 13 (temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets and public rights of way), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub‑paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46, and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6, the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub‑paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 8(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 8(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 8(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in paragraph 8(2) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
11.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaking in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

(3) The protective provisions in this Part of this Schedule apply and take precedence over article 35 (apparatus and rights of statutory undertakers in altered or closed streets) of the Order which does not apply to Cadent.
Apparatus of Cadent in altered or closed streets
20.  Notwithstanding the temporary alteration, diversion or restriction of use of any street under the powers of article 11 (power to alter layout, etc., of streets), article 13 (temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets and public rights of way) or article 17 (traffic regulation measures), Cadent will be at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as it would have been entitled to do immediately before such temporary alteration, diversion or restriction in respect of any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that street.
Protective works to buildings
21.  The undertaker must exercise the powers conferred by article 20 (protective works to buildings) so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of Cadent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Acquisition of land
22.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker may not appropriate or acquire any interest in land or appropriate, acquire, extinguish, interfere with or override any easement or other interest in land of Cadent otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the construction or maintenance of any part of the authorised development (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of Cadent or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Cadent and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as Cadent reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent unless otherwise agreed by Cadent, and the undertaker must use reasonable endeavours to procure or secure the consent to and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised development or maintenance thereof.
(3) The undertaker and Cadent agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus, including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by Cadent and other enactments relied upon by Cadent as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by Cadent under paragraph 25 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) As a condition of an agreement under sub-paragraph (1) that involves de-commissioned apparatus being left in situ the undertaker must accept a surrender of any existing easement or other interest of Cadent in such decommissioned apparatus and release Cadent from all liabilities in respect of such de-commissioned apparatus from the date of such surrender.
(6) Where an undertaker acquires land which is subject to any Cadent right or interest (including, without limitation, easements and agreements relating to rights or other interests) and the provisions of paragraph 23 do not apply, the undertaker must, unless Cadent agrees otherwise—
(a)
retain any notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land; and
(b)
where no such notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register, include with its application to register title to the undertaker’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry a notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land.
Removal of apparatus
23.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, including pursuant to any agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 22, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed and any right of Cadent to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished or interfered with until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and the facilities and rights referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of Cadent and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Cadent advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Cadent reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to Cadent to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 24(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus);
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus); and
(c)
to allow access to that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus).
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub‑paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for Cadent to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub‑paragraph (2) or (3), then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
24.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 31 of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of Cadent
25.—(1) Not less than 56 days (or such time period as may be agreed in writing between Cadent and the undertaker) before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to Cadent a plan and, if reasonably required by Cadent, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement which describes—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc.;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any specified works until Cadent has given written approval of the plan so submitted (and the ground monitoring scheme if required).
(4) Any approval of Cadent given under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub‑paragraph (5); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and Cadent must meaningfully engage with the undertaker within 28 days of the date of submission of the plan under sub‑paragraph (1).
(5) In relation to any specified works to which sub-paragraph (1) applies, Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plan as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Specified works must only be executed in accordance with—
(a)
the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) (and ground monitoring scheme if required), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent; and
(b)
all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and Cadent is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If Cadent, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs (1) to (3) and (6) to (8) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 23(2) provided that such written notice must be given by Cadent to the undertaker within 42 days of submission of a plan pursuant to sub-paragraph (1).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days (unless otherwise agreed in writing by Cadent and the undertaker) before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development (including such an event attributable to its maintenance)—
(a)
the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme; and
(b)
Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 26.
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(12) In this paragraph, “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to, or to prevent the occurrence of, circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works believes on reasonable grounds to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.
Expenses
26.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Cadent on demand, all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or reasonably incurred by Cadent in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised development including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by Cadent in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including professional fees) incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 23(3) if it elects to do so; or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers under this Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works (including any protective works pursuant to article 20 (protective works to buildings), plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works if required;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule; and
(g)
any watching brief pursuant to paragraph 25(6).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re–used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 31 to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Where the undertaker has paid to Cadent monies in respect of any reasonably anticipated charges, costs and expenses in accordance with sub-paragraph (1) and such charges, costs and expenses are subsequently not incurred by Cadent, Cadent must repay to the undertaker on demand the amount of such charges, costs and expenses.
Indemnity
27.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development (including works carried out under article 20 (protective works to buildings)) by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by the undertaker) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from Cadent, the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty, compensation or costs properly incurred by, paid by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Cadent becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any negligence, omission or default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed between the undertaker and Cadent.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect, omission or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any part of the authorised development carried out by Cadent in the exercise of any functions conferred by this Order pursuant to a grant or transfer under article 8 (consent to transfer benefit of the Order).
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering its representations.
(5) Cadent must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 27 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, Cadent must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker is only liable under this paragraph 27 for claims reasonably incurred by Cadent.
Enactments and agreements
28.  Except where this Part of this Schedule provides otherwise, or by agreement in writing between Cadent and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Cadent in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
29.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or Cadent requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 23(2) or Cadent makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 25, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Cadent’s undertaking and Cadent must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever Cadent’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by Cadent, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
30.  If in consequence of any agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 22(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable Cadent to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration

PART 4
FOR THE PROTECTION OF EASTERN POWER NETWORKS
33.  For the protection of EPN as referred to in this Part of this Schedule the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and EPN.
34.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable EPN to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(8)), belonging to or maintained by EPN;
“EPN” means Eastern Power Networks plc (company number 02366906) whose registered office is at Newington House, 237 Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 6NP;
“functions” includes powers and duties; and
“in”, in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land, includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land;
35.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and EPN are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
36.  Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 13 (temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets and public rights of way), EPN is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
37.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
38.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that EPN’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of EPN to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of EPN in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to EPN written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order EPN reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to EPN the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, EPN must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed provided that this obligation shall not require EPN to exercise any power it may have to acquire any land or rights by compulsory purchase order.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between EPN and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(5) EPN must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration), and after the grant to EPN of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to EPN that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by EPN, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of EPN.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
39.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to EPN facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and EPN or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to EPN than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to EPN as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
40.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 38(2), the undertaker must submit to EPN a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by EPN for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and EPN is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by EPN under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If EPN in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 38 to 39 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 38(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to EPN notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
41.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to EPN the reasonable expenses incurred by EPN in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 38(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to EPN by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 38(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to EPN in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on EPN any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
42.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 38(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of EPN, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by EPN, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by EPN in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify EPN for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from EPN,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of EPN, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) EPN must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
43.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and EPN in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

which is caused by, or results from, the construction of the specified work or any act or omission of the undertaker, its contractors, agents or employees whilst engaged upon the specified work.
(2) The Board must give to the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand, and no settlement or compromise may be made without the agreement of the undertaker which agreement must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(3) The Board must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any claims, demands, proceedings, costs, damages, expenses or loss to which this paragraph applies.
73.  The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done by the undertaker in accordance with a plan approved or deemed to be approved by the Board, or to its satisfaction, or in accordance with any directions or award of an arbitrator, does not relieve the undertaker from any liability under this Part.
74.  If in consequence of the powers granted under this Order the access to any drainage work is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such drainage work as will enable the Board to maintain or use the drainage work no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
75.—(1) The Board and the undertaker may enter into agreements with respect to the maintenance of any drainage work located within the boundary of Work No. 2B as shown on the works plans.
(2) Such an agreement may, without prejudice to the generality of sub-paragraph (1), contain such terms as to the nature and frequency of any maintenance works, payments and otherwise as the parties consider appropriate.
76.  Any dispute between the undertaker and the Board under this Part, unless otherwise agreed, must be determined by arbitration under article 46 (arbitration), but must be determined by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero acting jointly on a reference to them by the undertaker or the Board, after notice in writing by one to the other.
PART 7
FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANGLIAN WATER
77.  For the protection of Anglian Water, the following provisions shall, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Anglian Water, have effect.
78.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable Anglian Water to fulfil its statutory functions in no less efficient a manner than previously;
“Anglian Water” means Anglian Water Services Limited (company number 02366656) whose registered office is at Lancaster House, Lancaster Way, Ermine Business Park, Huntington, Cambridgeshire PE29 6XU;
“apparatus” means:
(a)
works, mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by Anglian Water for the purposes of water supply and sewerage;
(b)

(e)
includes a sludge main, disposal main or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming part of any sewer, drain or works (within the meaning of section 219 of that Act) and any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus,
and in this definition, expressions and words used in this definition and defined in section 219 (general interpretation) of the Water Industry Act 1991 have the same meaning as in that Act;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in” in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land; and
“plan” includes all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably necessary properly and sufficiently to describe the works to be executed.
On street apparatus
79.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and Anglian Water are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus in stopped up streets
80.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 11 (power to alter layout, etc., of streets), where Anglian Water has apparatus in the street or accessed by virtue of the street, it has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to Anglian Water legal easements reasonably satisfactory to Anglian Water in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of Anglian Water to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 83 or the power of the undertaker to carry out works under paragraph 85.
(2) Regardless of the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under the powers conferred by article 13 (temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets and public rights of way), Anglian Water is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
81.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 20 (protective works to buildings), must not exercise those powers so as to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of Anglian Water (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Acquisition of land
82.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
83.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that Anglian Water’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of Anglian Water to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until—
(a)
alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (8); and
(b)
facilities and rights have been secured for that alternative apparatus in accordance with paragraph 84.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to Anglian Water 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Anglian Water the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed Anglian Water must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Anglian Water and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(5) Anglian Water must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46, and after the grant to Anglian Water of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if Anglian Water gives notice in writing to the undertaker that it desires the undertaker to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker or to the extent that Anglian Water fails to proceed with that work in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or the undertaker and Anglian Water otherwise agree, that work, instead of being executed by Anglian Water, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water.
(7) If Anglian Water fails either reasonably to approve, or to provide reasons for its failure to approve along with an indication of what would be required to make acceptable, any proposed details relating to required removal works under sub-paragraph (2) within 28 days of receiving a notice of the required works from the undertaker, then such details are deemed to have been approved. For the avoidance of doubt, any such “deemed consent” does not extend to the actual undertaking of the removal works, which shall remain the sole responsibility of Anglian Water or its contractors.
(8) Whenever alternative apparatus is to be or is being substituted for existing apparatus, the undertaker shall, before taking or requiring any further step in such substitution works, use best endeavours to comply with Anglian Water’s reasonable requests for a reasonable period of time to enable Anglian Water to—
(a)
make network contingency arrangements; or
(b)
bring such matters as it may consider reasonably necessary to the attention of end users of the utility in question.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
84.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Anglian Water or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Anglian Water than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Anglian Water as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
(3) Such facilities and rights as are set out in this paragraph are deemed to include any statutory permits granted to the undertaker in respect of the apparatus in question, whether under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 or other legislation.
Retained apparatus
85.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus (or any means of access to it) the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 83(2), the undertaker must submit to Anglian Water a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub‑paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Anglian Water for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Anglian Water is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Anglian Water under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If Anglian Water in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 83 to 84 and 86 to 88 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 83(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give to Anglian Water notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances, using its reasonable endeavours to keep the impact of those emergency works on Anglian Water’s apparatus, on the operation of its water and sewerage network and on end-users of the services Anglian Water provides to a minimum.
(7) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) and without prejudice to the generality of the principles set out in that sub-paragraph, works are deemed to be in land near Anglian Water’s apparatus (where it is a pipe) if those works fall within the following distances measured from the medial line of such apparatus—
(a)
4 metres where the diameter of the pipe is less than 250 millimetres;
(b)
5 metres where the diameter of the pipe is between 250 and 400 millimetres, and
(c)
a distance to be agreed on a case by case basis and before the submission of the plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted where the diameter of the pipe exceeds 400 millimetres.
Expenses and costs
86.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Anglian Water all expenses reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Anglian Water by virtue of sub‑paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
87.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 81 or 83(2), or by reason of any subsidence resulting from such development or works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Anglian Water, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Anglian Water, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Anglian Water for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by Anglian Water,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Anglian Water on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Anglian Water or in accordance with any requirement of Anglian Water or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Anglian Water fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and professional like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the unlawful or unreasonable act, neglect or default of Anglian Water, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) Anglian Water must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made, without the consent of the undertaker (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Cooperation
88.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, the undertaker or Anglian Water requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 83(2) or Anglian Water makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 85, the undertaker must use all reasonable endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Anglian Water’s undertaking, using existing processes where requested by Anglian Water, provided it is appropriate to do so, and Anglian Water must use all reasonable endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
89.  Where the undertaker identifies any apparatus which may belong to or be maintainable by Anglian Water but which does not appear on any statutory map kept for the purpose by Anglian Water, it shall inform Anglian Water of the existence and location of the apparatus as soon as reasonably practicable.
90.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Anglian Water in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
91.  The undertaker and Anglian Water may by written agreement substitute any period of time for those periods set out in this Part of this Schedule.

(a)
in constructing any part of a specified work on behalf of the undertaker as provided by paragraph 96(3) or in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 96(4) including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signallers, watch-persons and other persons whom it shall be reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer, require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or from the substitution or diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work.
102.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
“Network Rail’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised development) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 96(1) for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 96(1)) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 96(1) has effect subject to the sub-paragraph.
(6) Prior to the commencement of operation of the authorised development the undertaker shall test the use of the authorised development in a manner that shall first have been agreed with Network Rail and if, notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing of the authorised development causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(c)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus or such EMI; and
(d)
the undertaker shall not allow the use or operation of the authorised development in a manner that has caused or will cause EMI until measures have been taken in accordance with this paragraph to prevent EMI occurring.
(8) Where Network Rail approves modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus pursuant to sub-paragraphs (5) or (6)—
(a)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail’s apparatus;
(b)
any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus approved pursuant to those sub-paragraphs must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 97.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 106(1) applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses suffered by Network Rail through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Network Rail’s apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which sub-paragraph 97 applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 101(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph shall be deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
(11) In relation to any dispute arising under this paragraph the reference in article 46 (arbitration) to the Institution of Civil Engineers shall be read as a reference to the Institution of Engineering and Technology.
103.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.
104.  The undertaker must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Network Rail unless it has first consulted Network Rail and it must comply with Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.
105.  Any additional expenses which Network Rail may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the undertaker, be repaid by the undertaker to Network Rail.
106.—(1) The undertaker must pay to Network Rail all reasonable costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part of this Schedule (subject to article 45 (no double recovery)) which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)

(b)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged upon a specified work;
(c)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst accessing to or egressing from the authorised development;

(e)
in respect of costs incurred by Network Rail in complying with any railway operational procedures or obtaining any regulatory consents which procedures are required to be followed or consents obtained to facilitate the carrying out or operation of the authorised development;
and the undertaker must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or any such failure, act or omission: and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision shall not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Network Rail must—
(a)
give the undertaker reasonable written notice of any such claims or demands;
(b)
not make any settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand without the prior consent of the undertaker; and
(c)
take such steps as are within its control and are reasonable in the circumstances to mitigate any liabilities relating to such claims or demands.
(3) The sums payable by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) shall if relevant include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs.
(4) Subject to the terms of any agreement between Network Rail and a train operator regarding the timing or method of payment of the relevant costs in respect of that train operator, Network Rail must promptly pay to each train operator the amount of any sums which Network Rail receives under sub-paragraph (3) which relates to the relevant costs of that train operator.
(5) The obligation under sub-paragraph (3) to pay Network Rail the relevant costs shall, in the event of default, be enforceable directly by any train operator concerned to the extent that such sums would be payable to that operator pursuant to sub-paragraph (4).
(6) In this paragraph—
“the relevant costs” means the costs, losses and expenses (including loss of revenue) reasonably incurred by each train operator as a consequence of any specified work including but not limited to any restriction of the use of Network Rail’s railway network as a result of the construction, maintenance or failure of a specified work or any such act or omission as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1); and
“train operator” means any person who is authorised to act as the operator of a train by a licence under section 8 of the Railways Act 1993.
107.  Network Rail must, on receipt of a request from the undertaker, from time to time provide the undertaker free of charge with written estimates of the costs, charges, expenses and other liabilities for which the undertaker is or will become liable under this Part of this Schedule (including the amount of the relevant costs mentioned in paragraph 106) and with such information as may reasonably enable the undertaker to assess the reasonableness of any such estimate or claim made or to be made pursuant to this Part of this Schedule (including any claim relating to those relevant costs).
108.  In the assessment of any sums payable to Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule there must not be taken into account any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken by or any agreement entered into by Network Rail if that action or agreement was not reasonably necessary and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or increasing the sums so payable.
109.  The undertaker and Network Rail may, subject in the case of Network Rail to compliance with the terms of its network licence, enter into, and carry into effect, agreements for the transfer to the undertaker of—

PART 9
FOR THE PROTECTION OF CAMBRIDGESHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL AS HIGHWAY AUTHORITY
114.—(1) The following provisions of this Part of this Schedule, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Cambridgeshire County Council, have effect.
(2) In this Part of this Schedule—
“highway” means any highway of which Cambridgeshire County Council is the highway authority;
“plans” includes sections, designs, drawings, specifications, soil reports, staging proposals, programmes, calculations, methods of construction, risk assessments and details of the extent, timing and duration of any proposed occupation of any highway and “approved plans” means plans approved or deemed to be approved or settled by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule; and
“property of Cambridgeshire County Council” means any apparatus or street furniture of the highway authority affixed to or placed under any highway.
“works” means so much of any part of the authorised development as forms part of or is intended to become a highway, or part of any such highway, or any work which could introduce water onto the highway or any work which is underneath or over the highway.
(3) Wherever in this Part of this Schedule provision is made with respect to the approval or consent of Cambridgeshire County Council, that approval or consent must be in writing and subject to such reasonable terms and conditions as Cambridgeshire County Council may require.
(4) In exercising the powers conferred by this Order in relation to any highway the undertaker must have regard to the potential disruption of traffic which may be caused and must seek to minimise such disruption so far as is reasonably practicable.
115.—(1) Before commencing the construction of, or the carrying out of any work which involves interference with a highway, the undertaker must submit to Cambridgeshire County Council for its approval plans relating thereto, and the works must not be carried out except in accordance with the plans submitted to, and approved by, Cambridgeshire County Council.
(2) If within 28 days after the plans have been submitted Cambridgeshire County Council has not approved or disapproved them, it is deemed to have approved the plans as submitted provided that this sub-paragraph does not apply to any plans submitted for approval pursuant to requirement 5 of Schedule 2 where the time periods set out in Schedule 12 apply.
(3) In the event of any disapproval of plans by Cambridgeshire County Council under sub‑paragraph (2), the undertaker shall re-submit the plans with modifications and, in that event, if Cambridgeshire County Council has not intimated its disapproval and the grounds of disapproval within 28 days of the plans being re-submitted, it is deemed to have approved them.
(4) The undertaker must include in any submission made to Cambridgeshire County Council under sub-paragraph (1) or any re-submission under sub-paragraph (3), a statement that the deemed approval provisions of sub-paragraph (2) or sub-paragraph (3) apply, as the case may be, and if the submission fails to do so, the deemed approval provision is null and void.
(5) Any officer of Cambridgeshire County Council duly appointed for the purpose of inspecting the works may at all reasonable times during the carrying out of work and following completion of the works, on giving to the undertaker such notice as may in the circumstances be reasonable, enter upon and inspect any part of the works authorised by this Order (and such inspection may include works to be uncovered as reasonably required by the officer at the cost of the undertaker) which—
(a)
is in, over or under any highway; or
(b)
which may affect any highway or any property of Cambridgeshire County Council,
during the carrying out of the work, and the undertaker must give to such officer all reasonable facilities for such inspection and shall ensure that the officer is accompanied by one of its contractors, agents or employees familiar with the works, if the officer is of the opinion that the construction of the work is attended with danger to any highway or to any property of Cambridgeshire County Council on or under any highway, the undertaker must adopt such measures and precautions as may be reasonably practicable for the purpose of preventing any damage or injury to the highway.
(6) In the construction of any part of the said works under a highway no part of it shall, except with the consent of Cambridgeshire County Council, be so constructed as to interfere with the provision of proper means of drainage of the surface of the highway.
116.—(1) The undertaker must not alter, disturb or in any way interfere with any property of Cambridgeshire County Council on or under any highway, or the access thereto, without the consent of the Cambridgeshire County Council, and any alteration, diversion, replacement or reconstruction of any such property which may be necessary may be made by Cambridgeshire County Council or the undertaker as the Cambridgeshire County Council thinks fit, and the expense reasonably incurred by Cambridgeshire County Council in so doing must be repaid to Cambridgeshire County Council by the undertaker.
(2) The undertaker must not under the powers conferred by or under this Order without the consent of Cambridgeshire County Council, acquire or enter upon, take or use whether temporarily or permanently or acquire any new rights over any part of any highway, including subsoil beneath the surface of any highway.
(3) If within 28 days after a request for consent has been submitted Cambridgeshire County Council has not given or refused such consent, it is deemed to have consented to the request as submitted provided that the undertaker includes in any such request for consent a statement confirming that the deemed consent provisions this paragraph apply to such request and if such request fails to do so, the deemed consent provision of this paragraph is null and void.
117.—(1) Where any part of any highway has been broken up or disturbed by the undertaker, the undertaker must make good the subsoil, foundations and surface of that part of the highway to the reasonable satisfaction of Cambridgeshire County Council and must maintain the same to the reasonable satisfaction of Cambridgeshire County Council for such time as may reasonably be required for the permanent reinstatement of the highway.
(2) The reinstatement of that part of the highway must be carried out by the undertaker to the reasonable satisfaction of Cambridgeshire County Council in accordance with such requirements as to specification of material and standards of workmanship as may be prescribed for equivalent reinstatement work by regulations made under section 71 of the 1991 Act.
118.  If any damage to any highway or any property of Cambridgeshire County Council on or under any highway is caused by, or results from, the construction of any work authorised by this Order or any act or omission of the undertaker, its contractors, agents or employees whilst engaged upon such work, the undertaker must, in the case of damage to a highway, make good such damage to the reasonable satisfaction of Cambridgeshire County Council and, where the undertaker does not make good, or in the case of damage to property of Cambridgeshire County Council, the undertaker must pay reasonable compensation to Cambridgeshire County Council for such damage.
119.  The fact that any act or thing may have been done in accordance with plans approved by Cambridgeshire County Council does not (if it was not attributable to the act, neglect or default of Cambridgeshire County Council or of any person in its employment or its contractors or agents) exonerate the undertaker from any liability, or affect any claim for damages, under this Part or otherwise.
120.  Cambridgeshire County Council must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which paragraph 118 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, Cambridgeshire County Council must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised. The undertaker is only liable under paragraph 118 for claims reasonably incurred by Cambridgeshire County Council.
121.  On completion of the works the undertaker must seek written certification from Cambridgeshire County Council that the works are acceptable and relevant drawings and new highway asset information shall be provided to Cambridgeshire County Council as part of the undertaker’s request for certification. Cambridgeshire County Council shall only resume its maintenance responsibilities for the affected highways once certification under this paragraph has been issued.
122.—(1) Cambridgeshire County Council must not unreasonably withhold or delay the issue of a written certification under paragraph 121. Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if Cambridgeshire County Council has not given or refused such written certification within 28 days, it is deemed to have issued a written certification provided that the undertaker includes in any such request for certification a statement confirming that the deemed certification provisions this paragraph apply to such request and if such request fails to do so, the deemed certification provision of this paragraph is null and void.
(2) Any officer of Cambridgeshire County Council duly appointed for the purpose of issuing a written certification under sub-paragraph (1) may at all reasonable times and on reasonable notice during the 28 day period enter upon and inspect any part of the completed works.
(3) If further information is requested by Cambridgeshire County Council, the 28 day period to issue a written certificate in accordance with sub-paragraph (1) will recommence starting on the date that such further information has been submitted by the undertaker to Cambridgeshire County Council.
123.  On receipt of certification that completed works are acceptable under paragraph 121 above unlocking devices for the new bollards on New Bridge Lane shall be provided by the undertaker to Cambridgeshire County Council.
124.  Any difference arising between the undertaker and the Cambridgeshire County Council under this part of this Schedule (other than in difference as to the meaning or construction of this Part of this Schedule) shall be resolved by arbitration under article 46 (arbitration).
125.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), the undertaker must indemnify Cambridgeshire County Council from and against all costs, expenses, damages, losses and liabilities suffered by Cambridgeshire County Council arising from or in connection with any claim, demand, action or proceedings resulting from damage caused by the construction, maintenance or use of the specified works.
(2) Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply if the costs, expenses, liabilities and damages were caused by or arose out of the neglect or default of Cambridgeshire County Council or its officers, servants, agents or contractors or any person or body for whom it is responsible.
(3) If any person makes a claim or notifies an intention to make a claim against Cambridgeshire County Council which may reasonably be considered likely to give rise to a liability under this paragraph then Cambridgeshire County Council must—
(a)
as soon as reasonably practicable give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand, specifying the nature of the indemnity liability in reasonable detail; and
(b)
not make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to the indemnity liability without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(4) The undertaker acknowledges that Cambridgeshire County Council may receive statutory compensation claims and that Cambridgeshire County Council may not be able to comply with sub-paragraph (3) in respect of such claims.
(5) Where Cambridgeshire County Council considers that sub-paragraph (4) applies to any claim or demand it must give notice of that view as part of the relevant notice provided pursuant to sub-paragraph (3)(a).
(6) Cambridgeshire County Council must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within Cambridgeshire County Council’s reasonable gift and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of Cambridgeshire County Council’s control. If reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker, Cambridgeshire County Council must provide an explanation of how any claim has been mitigated or minimised or where mitigation or minimisation is not possible an explanation as to why.
126.  All reasonable costs incurred by Cambridgeshire County Council under this part of this Schedule shall be paid in full by the undertaker on written demand by Cambridgeshire County Council.

such longer period as may be agreed in writing by the undertaker and the relevant authority,
whichever is the latest.
(2) Subject to paragraph (4), in the event that the relevant authority does not determine an application within the period set out in sub-paragraph (1), the relevant authority is to be taken to have granted all parts of the application (without any condition or qualification) at the end of that period.
(3) Any application made to the relevant planning authority pursuant to sub-paragraph (1) must:
(a)
include a statement to confirm whether it is likely that the subject matter of the application will give rise to any materially new or materially different environmental effects compared to those in the environmental statement and if it will then it must be accompanied by information setting out what those effects are; and
(b)
include confirmation that the application has been notified and provided to the requirement consultees in accordance with sub-paragraph (5), if the provision governing or requiring the application specifies that consultation with a requirement consultee is required.

(4) Where an application has been made to the relevant authority for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order, and—
(a)
the relevant authority does not determine the application within the period set out in sub‑paragraph (1) and such application is accompanied by a report pursuant to subparagraph (3) which states that the subject matter of such application is likely to give rise to any materially new or materially different environmental effects compared to those in the environmental statement; or
(b)
the relevant planning authority determines during the period set out in sub-paragraph (1) that it considers that the subject matter of such application will give rise to any materially new or materially different environmental effects compared to those in the environmental statement,
then the application is to be taken to have been refused by the relevant authority at the end of that period.
(5) At the same time as submitting an application to the relevant planning authority for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement, the undertaker must also give notice of such application, and provide a copy of the application, to any requirement consultee, if the provision governing or requiring the application specifies that consultation with a requirement consultee is required.

(3) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable him to consider the appeal he must, within five working days of his appointment, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required.
(4) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) must be provided by the undertaker to the appointed person, the relevant authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the article or requirement the subject of the appeal on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the appointed person within 10 working days of the specified date but otherwise is to be in accordance with the process and time limits set out in paragraphs (2)(c) to (2)(e).
(5) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal; or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not),
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to him in the first instance.
(6) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits.
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears to him that there is sufficient material to enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case.
(8) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(9) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is to be deemed to be an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 (requirements) as if it had been given by the relevant authority. The relevant authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.
(10) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (11) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(11) On application by the relevant authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to Planning Practice Guidance: Appeals (March 2014) or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.Article 42

SCHEDULE 15
ARBITRATION RULES
Primary objective
1.—(1) The primary objective of these Arbitration Rules is to achieve a fair, impartial, final and binding award on the substantive difference between the parties (save as to costs) within 4 months from the date the arbitrator is appointed pursuant to article 46.
(2) The parties will first use their reasonable endeavours to settle a dispute amicably through negotiations undertaken in good faith by the senior management of the parties. Any dispute which is not resolved amicably by the senior management of the parties within twenty (20) working days of the dispute arising, or such longer period as agreed in writing by the parties, will be subject to arbitration in accordance with the terms of this Schedule.
(3) The Arbitration will be deemed to have commenced when a party (“the Claimant”) serves a written notice of arbitration on the other party (“the Respondent”).
Time periods
2.—(1) All time periods in these Arbitration Rules will be measured in working days and this will exclude weekends, bank and public holidays.
(2) Time periods will be calculated from the day after the arbitrator is appointed which will be either—
(a)
the date the arbitrator notifies the parties in writing of his/her acceptance of an appointment by agreement of the parties; or
(b)
the date the arbitrator is appointed by the Secretary of State.
Timetable
3.—(1) The timetable for the arbitration will be that set out in sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) below unless amended in accordance with paragraph 5(3).
(2) Within 15 days of the arbitrator being appointed, the Claimant will provide both the Respondent and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written Statement of Claim which describes the nature of the difference between the parties, the legal and factual issues, the Claimant’s contentions as to those issues, and the remedy it is seeking; and
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of all documents on which it relies, including contractual documentation, correspondence (including electronic documents), legal precedents and expert witness reports.
(3) Within 15 days of receipt of the Claimant’s statements under sub-paragraph (2) by the arbitrator and Respondent, the Respondent will provide the Claimant and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written Statement of Defence responding to the Claimant’s Statement of Claim, its statement in respect of the nature of the difference, the legal and factual issues in the Claimant’s claim, its acceptance of any element(s) of the Claimant’s claim, its contentions as to those elements of the Claimant’s claim it does not accept;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of all documents on which it relies, including contractual documentation, correspondence (including electronic documents), legal precedents and expert witness reports; and
(c)
any objections it wishes to make to the Claimant’s statements, comments on the Claimant’s expert report(s) (if submitted by the Claimant) and explanations for the objections.
(4) Within 5 days of the Respondent serving its statements pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the Claimant may make a Statement of Reply by providing both the Respondent and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement responding to the Respondent’s submissions, including its reply in respect of the nature of the difference, the issues (both factual and legal) and its contentions in relation to the issues;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of documents in response to the Respondent’s submissions;
(c)
any expert report in response to the Respondent’s submissions;
(d)
any objections to the statements of evidence, expert reports or other documents submitted by the Respondent; and
(e)
its written submissions in response to the legal and factual issues involved.
Procedure
4.—(1) The arbitrator will make an award on the substantive difference(s) based solely on the written material submitted by the parties unless the arbitrator decides that a hearing is necessary to explain or resolve any matters.
(2) Either party may, within 2 days of delivery of the last submission, request a hearing giving specific reasons why it considers a hearing is required.
(3) Within 5 days of receiving the last submission, the arbitrator will notify the parties whether a hearing is to be held and the length of that hearing.
(4) Within 10 days of the arbitrator advising the parties that he will hold a hearing, the date and venue for the hearing will be fixed by agreement with the parties, save that if there is no agreement the arbitrator will direct a date and venue which he considers is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. The date for the hearing will not be less than 35 days from the date of the arbitrator’s direction confirming the date and venue of the hearing.
(5) A decision will be made by the arbitrator on whether there is any need for expert evidence to be submitted orally at the hearing. If oral expert evidence is required by the arbitrator, then any expert(s) attending the hearing may be asked questions by the arbitrator.
(6) There will be no process of examination and cross–examination of experts, but the arbitrator will invite the parties to ask questions of the experts by way of clarification of any answers given by the expert(s) in response to the arbitrator’s questions. Prior to the hearing the procedure for the expert(s) will be that—
(a)
at least 20 days before a hearing, the arbitrator will provide a list of issues to be addressed by the expert(s);
(b)
if more than one expert is called, they will jointly confer and produce a joint report or reports within 10 days of the issues being provided; and
(c)
the form and content of a joint report will be as directed by the arbitrator and must be provided at least 5 days before the hearing.
(7) Within 10 days of a hearing or a decision by the arbitrator that no hearing is to be held the parties may by way of exchange provide the arbitrator with a final submission in connection with the matters in dispute and any submissions on costs. The arbitrator will take these submissions into account in the award.
(8) The arbitrator may make other directions or rulings as considered appropriate in order to ensure that the parties comply with the timetable and procedures to achieve an award on the substantive difference within 4 months of the date on which they are appointed, unless both parties otherwise agree to an extension to the date for the award.
(9) If a party fails to comply with the timetable, procedure or any other direction then the arbitrator may continue in the absence of a party or submission or document, and may make a decision on the information before them attaching the appropriate weight to any evidence submitted beyond any timetable or in breach of any procedure or direction or both.
(10) The arbitrator’s award will include reasons. The parties will accept that the extent to which reasons are given will be proportionate to the issues in dispute and the time available to the arbitrator to deliver the award.
Arbitrator’s powers
5.—(1) The arbitrator has all the powers of the Arbitration Act 1996(1), including the non–mandatory sections, save where modified by these Rules.
(2) There will be no discovery or disclosure, except that the arbitrator will have the power to order the parties to produce such documents as are reasonably requested by another party no later than the Statement of Reply, or by the arbitrator, where the documents are manifestly relevant, specifically identified and the burden of production is not excessive. Any application and orders should be made by way of a Redfern Schedule without any hearing.
(3) Any time limits fixed in accordance with this procedure or by the arbitrator may be varied by agreement between the parties, subject to any such variation being acceptable to and approved by the arbitrator. In the absence of agreement, the arbitrator may vary the timescales or procedure or both—
(a)
if the arbitrator is satisfied that a variation of any fixed time limit is reasonably necessary to avoid a breach of the rules of natural justice; and
(b)
only for such a period that is necessary to achieve fairness between the parties.
(4) On the date the award is made, the arbitrator will notify the parties that the award is completed, signed and dated, and that it will be issued to the parties on receipt of cleared funds for the arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
Costs
6.—(1) The costs of the Arbitration will include the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the reasonable fees and expenses of any experts and the reasonable legal and other costs incurred by the parties for the Arbitration.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), the arbitrator will award recoverable costs on the general principle that each party should bear its own costs.
(3) The arbitrator may depart from the general principle in sub-paragraph (2) and make such other costs award as it considers reasonable where a party has behaved unreasonably as defined within the National Planning Practice Guidance or such other guidance as may replace it.
Confidentiality
7.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), any arbitration hearing and documentation will be open to and accessible by the public.
(2) The arbitrator may direct that the whole or part of a hearing is to be private or any documentation to be confidential where it is necessary in order to protect commercially sensitive information.
(3) Nothing in this paragraph will prevent any disclosure of a document by a party pursuant to an order of a court in England and Wales or where disclosure is required under any enactment.

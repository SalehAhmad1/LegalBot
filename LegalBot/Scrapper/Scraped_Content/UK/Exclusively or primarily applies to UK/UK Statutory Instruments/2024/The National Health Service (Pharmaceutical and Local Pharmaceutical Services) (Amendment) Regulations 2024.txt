(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013 (“the PLPS Regulations”). The PLPS Regulations govern the arrangements in England, under Part 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”), for the provision of NHS pharmaceutical and local pharmaceutical services.
The scheme for paying for NHS pharmaceutical and local pharmaceutical services is predicated on the basis that pharmaceutical remuneration that relates to prescription items will ordinarily include an amount which is in respect of (but ordinarily slightly more than) the price that a service provider paid when they purchased a prescription item that they go on to supply or administer. However, there are powers in Part 7 of the 2006 Act to enable alternatives to these ordinary remuneration arrangements in some circumstances. Regulation 2 amends the alternative arrangements that already allow a zero or nominal NHS reimbursement price to be set for centrally purchased coronavirus vaccines so that they also apply to centrally purchased respiratory syncytial virus vaccines and centrally purchased measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.
An assessment of the effect of this instrument was undertaken and it was deemed that a full impact assessment would not be proportionate. These Regulations are expected to have no or no significant impact on the public and voluntary sectors, and only a limited impact on the private sector, below the threshold for undertaking a full impact assessment.

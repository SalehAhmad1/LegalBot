28th February 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations further amend the National Health Service Pension Scheme Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/300) (“the 1995 Regulations”), the National Health Service Pension Scheme (Additional Voluntary Contributions) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/619) (“the 2000 Regulations”); the National Health Service Pension Scheme Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/653) (“the 2008 Regulations”); the National Health Service Pension Scheme Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/94) (“the 2015 Regulations”); the National Health Service Pension Scheme (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/95) (“the Transitional Regulations”) and the National Health Service Pension Schemes (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/301).
These Regulations come into force on 1st April 2024, although regulation 1(3) provide for certain provisions to take effect from an earlier date. Section 3(3)(b) of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25) provides that Scheme Regulations may make retrospective provision.
Regulations 3 and 4 amend the 1995 Regulations to make provision regarding definitions.
Regulations 5, 6 and 7 make provision regarding partial retirement in the 1995 Scheme in two ways. Firstly, regulations 5(2)(a) and (b), (3), (5) and (6), and regulation 7(2) ensure that members of the 1995 Scheme who have reached maximum service are able to access partial retirement with respect to their 1995 Scheme benefits. Secondly, regulations 5(2)(c), 6, 7(3) and (4) ensure that the effect on pensionable pay of entering into or leaving a salary sacrifice arrangement is disregarded for partial retirement purposes.
Regulation 5(4) amends the 1995 Regulations to reflect changes made by the Finance Act 2024, in removing the lifetime allowance and replacing this with the lump sum and death benefit allowance. The 2008, 2015 and Transitional Regulations are amended to similar effect by regulations 12(4), 16(3), 25(3) and 33 respectively.
Regulations 8 and 35 amend the 1995 Regulations and the Transitional Regulations respectively to remove special class abatement.

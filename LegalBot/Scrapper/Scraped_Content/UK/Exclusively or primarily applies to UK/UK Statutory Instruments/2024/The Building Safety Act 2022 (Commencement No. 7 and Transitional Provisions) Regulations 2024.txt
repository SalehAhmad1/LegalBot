28th January 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are the seventh commencement Regulations made under the Building Safety Act 2022 (c. 30) (“the 2022 Act”).
Regulation 2 brings into force on 6th April 2024 a number of provisions of the 2022 Act, amending the Building Act 1984 (c. 55) (“the 1984 Act”), which in particular provide for the transfer of approved inspectors to become registered building control approvers. This is achieved, in England, by commencing sections 43 of, and Schedule 4 to, the 2022 Act. The amendments to the 1984 Act made by the 2022 Act also provide for plans certificates, cancellation of initial notices and new initial notices. Welsh Ministers have separate powers to commence most of the provisions in Part 3 of the 2022 Act in relation to Wales.
Regulations 3 to 6 set out transitional provisions, in particular to ensure that existing approved inspectors can continue to operate. S.I. 2023/906 and S.I. 2023/909 made transitional provisions in relation to initial notices and approved inspectors which would continue to apply.
There are three impact assessments for implementing the changes to the building safety regime, they were published alongside the explanatory memorandum for S.I.s 2023/906, 2023/907 and 2023/911 at www.legislation.gov.uk.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT REGULATIONS

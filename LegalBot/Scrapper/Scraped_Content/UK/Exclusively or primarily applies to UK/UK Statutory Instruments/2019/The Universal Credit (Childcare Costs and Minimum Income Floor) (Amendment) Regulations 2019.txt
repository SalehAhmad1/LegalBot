These Regulations amend the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376).
Regulation 2 extends the time which claimants have to report payment of childcare costs in order for those costs to be taken into account in the childcare costs element when calculating an award of Universal Credit.
Regulation 3 clarifies that all claimants who satisfy the gainful self-employment test, are expected to work and do not benefit from the start-up period, are subject to the Minimum Income Floor (MIF). They cannot be exempted from the MIF based on average earnings.

Part 2 amends legislation concerning animal health required as a result of recent amendments made to EU legislation. It amends retained direct EU legislation and secondary legislation.
Part 3 amends the Genetically Modified Organisms (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/90) to correct some minor inconsistencies of terminology.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

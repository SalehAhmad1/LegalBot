8th October 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Trade Remedies (Increase in Imports Causing Serious Injury to UK Producers) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019(1) provide for certain EU safeguarding remedies (tariff rate quotas) that will be in place immediately before the United Kingdom leaves the European Union to take effect (with appropriate adjustments) as new UK tariff rate quotas. These Regulations amend those Regulations to give effect to changes introduced to the EU safeguarding remedies by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1590 of 26 September 2019 amending Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/159 imposing definitive safeguard measures against imports of certain steel products(2) so that they can be implemented when the new UK tariff rate quotas take effect. Those changes include, for example, stipulating that access to the tariff rate quota for a particular category of steel products is to be restricted based on end-use, and limiting each country’s access to only a specified proportion of the global/residual quota.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument as the expected impact of the trade remedies system has already been assessed in the impact assessment accompanying the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018.

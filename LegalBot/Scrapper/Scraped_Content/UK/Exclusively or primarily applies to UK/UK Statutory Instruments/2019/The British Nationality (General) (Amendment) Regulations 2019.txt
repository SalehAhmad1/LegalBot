(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Regulations amend the British Nationality (General) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”), which detail the procedures and requirements relating to applications in connection with British nationality made under the British Nationality Act 1981 (“the 1981 Act”).
Regulation 2 amends regulation 5A of the 2003 Regulations, which sets out how applicants for naturalisation as a British citizen under section 6 of the 1981 Act must demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the English language and life in the United Kingdom. Paragraph 2 amends the 2003 Regulations so that a person will have sufficient knowledge of the English language for the purpose of an application for naturalisation as a British citizen under 6 of the 1981 Act if they have passed a Secure English Language Test which: is at a level equivalent to level B1 or above on the Council of Europe’s Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment; was taken at an approved English language test provider; and was taken no more than two years before the date of the application for naturalisation. A list of Secure English Language Tests and approved test providers is published on the UK Visas and Immigration pages of Gov.uk. A hard copy is available from the Nationality Policy Team, Home Office, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF.

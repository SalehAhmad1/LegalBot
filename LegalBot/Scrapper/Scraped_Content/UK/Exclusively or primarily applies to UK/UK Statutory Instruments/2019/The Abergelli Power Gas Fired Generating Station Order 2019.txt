Removal of apparatus
36.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of WPD to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation and access to it has been provided if necessary to the reasonable satisfaction of WPD.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to WPD written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order WPD reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker shall, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to WPD the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land owned or controlled by the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus and—
(a)
if, for the purpose of executing any works, the undertaker requires to remove or divert any apparatus placed within the Order land, and alternative apparatus or any part of such alternative apparatus is to be constructed in land other than the Order land as a consequence of the removal or diversion of apparatus, then the undertaker shall use its reasonable endeavours to obtain alternative rights in other land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed;
(b)
should the undertaker not be able to obtain the alternative rights required under sub-paragraph (a) then the undertaker and WPD shall use reasonable endeavours to agree a reasonably practicable and mutually agreeable alternative engineering solution which does not require alternative apparatus to be constructed in land other than Order land and does not require alternative rights; and
(c)
if alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker and the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) and an alternative engineering solution cannot be agreed in accordance with sub-paragraph (b), WPD shall on receipt of written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to a requirement on WPD to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless WPD elects to do so.
(3) Any alternative apparatus required pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) shall be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between WPD and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled in accordance with paragraph 39.
(4) WPD shall, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled pursuant to paragraph 39, and after the grant to WPD of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule 11.
(5) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (4), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to WPD that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by WPD, shall be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of WPD.
(6) Nothing in sub-paragraph (5) shall authorise the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 600 millimetres of the apparatus.
(7) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to WPD facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights shall be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and WPD or in default of agreement settled in accordance with paragraph 39.

(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised development and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the undertaker; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in the land for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(9) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the expert less favourable on the whole to WPD than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the expert shall make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to WPD as appears to the expert to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
(10) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule WPD require that alternative apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions, or at a greater depth is necessary in substitution for existing apparatus which for WPD’s network requirements is over and above what is necessary as a consequence of and for the purpose of the authorised development WPD shall reduce the cost of such additional requirements from the amount payable by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 38(1).
(11) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (10)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.

(2) DCC must examine the draft specification submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and give its written consent or proposed amendments (each not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to the draft specification (including the proposed commencement date and anticipated completion date) within 28 days from the date of receipt (and in the event of amendments the process in this sub-paragraph (2) must be repeated where those amendments are not accepted). For the avoidance of doubt, DCC’s proposed amendments may include such reasonable requirements for the alteration (including but not limited to the extension of DCC apparatus) or otherwise for the protection of DCC apparatus, or for securing access to it.
(3) Once approved under sub-paragraph (2), the draft specification is to be the specification and the works must be executed only in accordance with the specification and such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) and DCC is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(4) Nothing in this paragraph 44 precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a draft specification instead of the draft specification previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph 44 apply to and in respect of the new draft specification.

(6) DCC may opt to carry out any temporary and/or protective works specified under sub-paragraph (2) to DCC apparatus, and if DCC opts to do so it must—
(a)
agree the scope and timings of the works with the undertaker (and the undertaker must not unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement to the same);
(b)
provide an invoice together with supporting evidence of the estimated costs of the works on the basis of which it must agree with the undertaker the reasonable costs of the works to be met by the undertaker;
(c)
following agreement and payment of the costs, DCC must as soon as reasonably practicable carry out and complete the works; and
(d)
notify the undertaker immediately in writing upon completion of the temporary and/or protective works.
(7) Only those contractors that satisfy DCC’s reasonable health and safety requirements are permitted to make openings into or connections with or carry out any works on or within any public sewer or drain vested in DCC unless otherwise agreed with DCC.
(8) Only DCC is permitted to make openings into or connections with or carry out any works on or within any public water main vested in DCC unless otherwise agreed with DCC.
(9) Where DCC apparatus will be affected by the works the undertaker must determine the exact location of DCC apparatus prior to any works being carried out by the undertaker and the undertaker should contact DCC where trial holes are required.

(c)
DCC must submit to the undertaker within 3 days following the suspension, a written notice specifying the reasons for suspending the works;
(d)
in the event that DCC fails to supply the written notice within 3 days of suspension, DCC’s instruction to suspend the works will be void and the undertaker will be entitled to recommence the works; and

(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a protected person on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a protected person or in accordance with any requirement of the protected person or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) where the undertaker fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner which does not materially accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed between the undertaker and the protected person.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—

any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of the protected person, its officers, servants, contractors or agents or is otherwise caused by or is attributable to the protected person; and
(b)

(4) The protected person must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise will be made without first consulting the undertaker and taking into account its representations.
(5) The protected person must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which this paragraph 64 applies.

Further information
2.—(1) In relation to any part of the application to which this Schedule applies, the relevant planning authority may request such reasonable further information from the undertaker as is necessary to enable it to consider the application.

(3) If the provision governing or requiring the application specifies that consultation with a requirement consultee is required, the relevant planning authority must issue the consultation to the requirement consultee within five business days of receipt of the application, and must notify the undertaker in writing specifying any further information requested by the requirement consultee within five business days of receipt of such a request and in any event within twenty–eight days of receipt of the application.

Appeals
3.—(1) The undertaker may appeal in the event that—
(a)
the relevant planning authority refuses an application for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order or grants it subject to conditions;
(b)
the relevant planning authority is deemed to have refused an application pursuant to paragraph 1(4);
(c)
on receipt of a request for further information pursuant to paragraph 2 the undertaker considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the relevant planning authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or
(d)
on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant planning authority notifies the undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the application.
(2) The appeal process is to be as follows—
(a)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning authority and the requirement consultee (together with the undertaker, these are the “appeal parties”);
(b)
the Secretary of State must appoint a person within twenty business days of receiving the appeal documentation and must forthwith notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for his attention should be sent, the date of such notification being the “start date” for the purposes of this sub-paragraph (2);
(c)
the relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within twenty business days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(d)
the appeal parties must make any counter–submissions to the appointed person within twenty business days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph (c) above;
(e)
the appointed person must make his decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within thirty business days of the deadline for the receipt of counter–submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (d); and.
(f)
the appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (b) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(3) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable him to consider the appeal he must, within five business days of his appointment, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required.
(4) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) must be provided by the undertaker to the appointed person, the relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the appointed person within ten business days of the specified date but must otherwise be in accordance with the process and time limits set out in sub-paragraphs (2)(c) to (2)(e).
(5) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal, or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant planning authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not),
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to him in the first instance.
(6) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits.
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears to him that there is sufficient material to enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case.
(8) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(9) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is deemed to be an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 (requirements) as if it had been given by the relevant planning authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.
(10) The appointed person may or may not be a member of the Planning Inspectorate but must be a qualified town planner of at least ten years’ experience.
(11) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (12) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(12) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to the Development Management Manual, Section 12 Annex: Award of Costs, or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

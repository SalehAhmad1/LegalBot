(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the statutory utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in such position as described in sub-paragraph (a).

23.—(1) Prior to installation, details of all mechanical and ventilation plant and any other noise-making machinery, or mobile plant (including HGV chiller units) that is intended to be used on any of the warehouses or other buildings within the main site, must be submitted to and approved in writing by the relevant planning authority. This will include an assessment of the expected noise impact at relevant receptors using a methodology first approved in writing by the relevant planning authority. The assessment will consider noise from the proposed plant and machinery to demonstrate compliance with government and local policy on noise. Any fixed plant or ventilation equipment must be installed and operated in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions at all times.
(2) The undertaker must during the course of 2032 carry out a scheme of monitoring of the operational railway noise arising from the use of the authorised development. The scheme of monitoring must first be approved by the relevant planning authority and be designed to establish whether there is a significant adverse effect (as defined in paragraph 8.3.32 of Chapter 8 of the environmental statement) at any residential property arising from night-time maximum levels. In the event of there being significant adverse effects as a result of the use of the authorised development the undertaker must agree with the relevant planning authority a noise insulation scheme for the properties concerned, based on the principles of the 1996 Regulations, and must implement the agreed scheme in accordance with a timetable agreed with the relevant planning authority.
(3) In the event that between 2032 and 2042 there is an increase in the number of train movements at night arising from the use of the authorised development the undertaker must during the course of 2042 carry out a scheme of monitoring of the operational railway noise arising from the use of the authorised development. The scheme of monitoring must first be approved by the relevant planning authority and be designed to establish whether there is a significant adverse effect (as defined in paragraph 8.3.32 of chapter 8 of the environmental statement) at any residential property arising from night-time maximum levels. In the event of there being significant adverse effects as a result of the use of the authorised development the undertaker must agree with the relevant planning authority a noise insulation scheme for the properties concerned, based on the principles of the 1996 Regulations, and must implement the agreed scheme in accordance with a timetable agreed with the relevant planning authority.

Contamination risk
25.—(1) None of the authorised development is to commence on any specifically identified localised areas of land within the Order limits potentially affected by contamination as identified within the desk study contained within chapter 6 of the environmental statement until further investigations and a risk based land contamination assessment (geo-environmental interpretative report) has been undertaken in line with the recommendations made within the desk study for that localised area of the Order limits and this has been submitted to and approved in writing by the relevant planning authority. The risk based land contamination assessment must be carried out in accordance with the Environment Agency’s Land Contamination: Risk Management manual (“the LCRM”).
(2) Should any unacceptable risks be identified in the risk based land contamination assessment, a remediation strategy scheme also detailing a proposed verification works plan must be prepared and submitted to and agreed in writing by the relevant planning authority. The remedial scheme must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the LCRM. The verification plan must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of—
(a)
Evidence Report on the Verification of Remediation of Land Contamination Report SC030114/R1, published by the Environment Agency 2010; and
(b)
the LCRM.
(3) If, during the course of construction, previously unidentified contamination is discovered, construction must cease on that localised area of land within the Order limits and the contamination must be reported in writing to the relevant planning authority within 10 working days. Prior to the recommencement of construction on that localised area of land within the Order limits, suitable investigation and risk based land contamination assessment for the discovered contamination (to include any required amendments to the remedial scheme and verification plan) must be submitted to and approved in writing by the relevant planning authority. The authorised development must then be implemented in accordance with the details approved by the relevant planning authority and, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the relevant planning authority, retained as such in perpetuity.

12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised works where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
“Network Rail’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised works) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 5(1) of this Part of this Schedule for the relevant part of the authorised works giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised works take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 5(1)) of this Part of this Schedule in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 5(1) of this Part of this Schedule have effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) If at any time prior to the commencement of regular revenue-earning operations on the authorised railway comprised in the authorised works and notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing or commissioning of the authorised works causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI; and

Security
9.—(1) Subject to paragraph 3(4) of this Part of this Schedule the undertaker must provide security for the carrying out of the HE works as follows—
(a)
prior to the commencement of each phase, the HE works within that phase must be secured by a bond from a bondsman first approved by Highways England drafted substantially as detailed in Form 1 contained in paragraph 17 of this Part of this Schedule, or such other form that may be agreed between the undertaker and Highways England, to indemnify Highways England against all losses, damages, costs or expenses arising from any breach of any one or more of the obligations of the undertaker in respect of that phase under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, provided that the maximum liability of the bond does not exceed the bond sum relating to that phase; and
(b)
prior to the commencement of the HE works, the undertaker must provide the cash surety which may be utilised by Highways England in the event of the undertaker failing to meet its obligations to make payments under paragraph 5 of this Part of this Schedule or to carry out works the need for which arises from a breach of one or more of the obligations of the undertaker (which will be a single cash surety for the entirety of the HE works).
(2) Each bond sum and the cash surety (the latter in respect of the final phase only) is to be progressively reduced as follows—
(a)
on receipt of written confirmation (including receipt of receipted invoices evidencing payments made by the undertaker to the contractors) from the undertaker of the payments made from time to time to the contractor, Highways England must, in writing, authorise the reduction of the bond sum by such proportion of the bond sum as amounts to 80% of those payments provided that an evaluation of the HE works completed and remaining has been carried out by the undertaker and audited and agreed by Highways England to ensure that the stage of completion of the works is relative to the payments made by the undertaker to the contractors. Highways England will only be required to provide the said authorisation if it is satisfied that the monies remaining secured by the bond sum will be sufficient to cover all remaining costs and liabilities anticipated to be incurred in completing the HE works plus an additional 20%;
(b)
within 20 working days of completion of each phase of the HE works (as evidenced by the issuing of the provisional certificate in respect of that phase in accordance with paragraph 6(1) of this Part of this Schedule) Highways England must, in writing, release the bond provider from its obligations in respect of 80% of the bond sum relating to that phase (“the revised bond sum”) save insofar as any claim or claims have been made against the bond and/or liability on its part has arisen prior to that date, in which case Highways England will retain a sufficient sum to meet all necessary costs; and
(c)
within 20 working days of the issue of the final certificate for each phase of the HE works referred to in paragraph 8 of this Part of this Schedule, Highways England must, in writing, release the bond provider from its obligations in respect of the revised bond sum relating to that phase and (in respect of the final phase) release the remainder of the cash surety to the undertaker save insofar as any claim or claims have been made against the bond or liability on its part has arisen prior to that date, in which case Highways England will retain a sufficient sum to meet all necessary costs.

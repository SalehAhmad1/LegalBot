PART 3
General provisions
Redundant fixed equipment
15.—(1) If the landlord or tenant is of the opinion that an item of fixed equipment is, or before the same was damaged or destroyed by fire was, redundant to the farming of the holding, the landlord or tenant may, by two months notice in writing served on the other, refer the question to arbitration under the Act unless the landlord and tenant agree to refer the question for third party determination.
(2) In any such arbitration or third party determination, no item of fixed equipment may be determined to be, or to have been before damage or destruction by fire, redundant to the farming of the holding, unless the arbitrator or third party is satisfied that the repair or replacement of such item is or was not reasonably required having regard to—
(a)
the landlord’s responsibilities to manage the holding in accordance with the rules of good estate management;
(b)
the period for which the holding may reasonably be expected to remain a separate holding; and
(c)
the character and situation of the holding and the average requirements of a tenant reasonably skilled in husbandry.
(3) Where an arbitrator awards or a third party determines that the said item of fixed equipment is, or before such damage or destruction by fire was, redundant to the farming of the holding then, as from the date of the award or determination—
(a)
paragraph 16(b) applies to that item and both the landlord and tenant are relieved from all liability in respect of any antecedent breach of any obligation to maintain, repair or replace that item of fixed equipment; and
(b)
the landlord is entitled to demolish and remove that item of fixed equipment and to enter the holding for those purposes.
No liability for landlord and tenant
16.  Nothing contained in Part 1 or Part 2 of this Schedule creates any liability for either the landlord or tenant—
(a)
to maintain, repair, replace or insure any item of fixed equipment which the landlord and the tenant agree in writing to be obsolete or redundant to the farming of the holding;
(b)
to maintain, repair, replace or insure any item of fixed equipment which, in the event of any dispute between the landlord and tenant as to whether it is, or before being damaged or destroyed by fire was, redundant to the farming of the holding, is awarded or determined to be redundant by an arbitrator or third party under paragraph 15; or
(c)
to execute any work if and so far as the execution of such work is rendered impossible (except at prohibitive or unreasonable expense) by reason of subsidence of any land or the blocking of outfalls which are not under the control of either the landlord or tenant.
Dispute mechanism
17.  Any matter arising under these Regulations, unless otherwise provided for under these provisions, may, in default of agreement, be determined by arbitration or third party determination under the Act.Regulation 4

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace, in relation to Wales, the Agriculture (Maintenance, Repair and Insurance of Fixed Equipment) Regulations 1973 (the “1973 Regulations”). They prescribe terms, set out in Schedule 1, as to the maintenance, repair and insurance of fixed equipment which are deemed to be incorporated in every contract of tenancy of an agricultural holding except where they would impose on one of the parties to a written agreement a liability which under the agreement is imposed on the other. Schedule 1 divides between the landlord and the tenant of a holding the responsibility for maintaining, repairing and insuring fixed equipment, and imposes upon each party certain specific liabilities in regard to those matters.
The main changes to the 1973 Regulations are as follows, references being to paragraphs in Schedule 1.
Certain items have been added to the general repair and replacement obligations of the landlord under paragraph 1 including the repair and replacement of the electrical supply system. The list of items in respect of which the landlord may recover one-half cost from the tenant has been extended (paragraph 7).
Certain items have been added to the general repair and maintenance obligations of the tenant under paragraphs 9 and 11 including fixed equipment generating heat or power and slurry, silage and effluent systems.
The circumstances in which the tenant may execute repairs or replacements which are the liability of the landlord has been extended under paragraph 12 so that the tenant may repair fire and carbon monoxide detectors and underground water pipes without notice served on the landlord. (See also paragraphs 14(3)(b) and (c)).
The limit on the tenant’s liability for replacement of roof tiles or slates is increased from £100 to £500 (paragraph 9(2)(e)).
Paragraphs 6, 13 and 17 include provision for third party determination as an alternative to arbitration.
Regulation 3 prescribes time limits for the purposes of section 9 of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986. Regulation 4 and Schedule 2 contain revocations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff CF10 3NQ.

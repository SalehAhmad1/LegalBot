Made

Laid before Parliament

Coming into force
1st October 2021
The Secretary of State makes these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 16(1)(e), 26(3) and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990(1), and, in relation to regulation 2(4), (6) and (10), by paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to the European Communities Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”)(2).
The Secretary of State is a Minister designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the 1972 Act in relation to food and drink intended for sale for human consumption, including the presentation, packaging, labelling, marketing and advertising of such food and drink(3).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the 1972 Act and it appears to the Secretary of State that it is expedient for references to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers(4) mentioned in regulation 2(4) and (6) of these Regulations to be construed as references to that instrument as amended from time to time.
The Secretary of State has had regard to relevant advice given by the Food Standards Agency in accordance with section 48(4A) of the Food Safety Act 1990(5).
There has been consultation as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(6) during the preparation, evaluation and revision of food law in relation to these Regulations.

There is an exemption for packaging or containers the largest surface of which has an area of less than 10cm2. There is also an exemption where an offer for sale is made by means of distance communication.
New regulation 6A, inserted by regulation 2(6) of this instrument, provides that food that is prepacked for direct sale, whether supplied to a final consumer or to a mass caterer, must have the name of the food provided directly on the package or on a label attached to the package.

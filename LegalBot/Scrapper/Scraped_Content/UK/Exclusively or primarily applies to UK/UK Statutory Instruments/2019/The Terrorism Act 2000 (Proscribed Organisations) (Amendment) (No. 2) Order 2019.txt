(This note is not part of the Order)
Part 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) makes provision about proscribed organisations (including setting out offences in relation to such organisations in sections 11 to 13). An organisation is proscribed if it is listed in Schedule 2 to that Act or, in most cases, if it operates under the same name as an organisation so listed (section 3(1)). Article 2 of this Order removes the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group from the list in Schedule 2, so that the organisation is no longer proscribed.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

Two of the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and CustomsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under sections 8(2)(a), 8(2)(b), 8(2)(g) and 8(3)(a)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of customs safety and security procedures to ensure that those procedures continue to operate effectively in the context of the United Kingdom no longer being a member of the European Union. The Regulations make provision in relation to waivers and time-limits during a transitional period and in relation to combining declarations.
This instrument will be covered by an overarching HMRC impact assessment (third edition) which will be published and available on the website at:

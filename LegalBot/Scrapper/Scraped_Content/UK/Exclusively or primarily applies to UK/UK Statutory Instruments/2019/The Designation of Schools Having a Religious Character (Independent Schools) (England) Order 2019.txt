30th August 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order designates the independent schools listed in article 2 as having a religious character and revokes the instruments listed in article 3 to the extent set out in that article. The first revocation relates to a school which has been closed. The second revocation relates to a school which was previously designated but has changed its location. This school is re-designated by article 2(1)(c). The third revocation also relates to a school which has been closed.
Under section 124A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, independent schools which are so designated are permitted to take account of certain religious or denominational considerations in making specified employment decisions which relate to teaching staff (such as decisions on appointment or promotion).
Designation by this Order is not of itself a means of acquiring a religious character or of changing religious character. Designation is the recognition of certain existing attributes of the school or its governing body as described in the Religious Character of Schools (Designation Procedure) (Independent Schools) (England) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/2314, as amended by S.I. 2004/2262).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

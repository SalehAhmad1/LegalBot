(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations replace the Official Controls (Animals, Food and Feed) (England) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/3472) and substantially amend the Trade in Animals and Related Products Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1197) that apply in England only.
These Regulations implement and enforce Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (OJ No. L 95, 7.4.2017, p. 1) on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (“the EU Regulation”) except as regards certain provisions of that Regulation.
Implementation and enforcement of certain provisions of the EU Regulation relating to feed and food are the subject of the Official Feed and Food Controls (England) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/3255).
Implementation and enforcement of provisions relating to plant health and protective measures against plant pests are the subject of separate Regulations.
Part 2 provides for audits to be undertaken of official controls and other official activities in accordance with the EU Regulation.
Part 3 provides for assistance and co-operation under Title IV of the EU Regulation and recovery of expenses.
Part 4 provides for enforcement and penalties.
Part 5 deals with consequential amendments as a result of the application of the EU Regulation.
Part 6 contains amendments to secondary legislation relating to plant health fees as a result of the application of the EU Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament of the Council on protective measures against pests of plants (OJ No. L 317, 23.11.2016, p.4).
Part 7 inserts a review provision in accordance with the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (c. 26), and revokes the Official Controls (Animals, Food and Feed) (England) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/3472).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

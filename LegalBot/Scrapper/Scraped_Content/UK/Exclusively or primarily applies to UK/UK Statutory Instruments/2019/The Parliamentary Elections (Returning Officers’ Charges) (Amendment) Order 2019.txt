13th November 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officers’ Charges) Order 2019 (“the 2019 Order”).
The 2019 Order provides for payments for services and expenses of returning officers in connection with the conduct of parliamentary elections in England, Wales and Scotland. The Schedule to the 2019 Order specifies maximum amounts recoverable by returning officers in each parliamentary constituency in England, Wales and Scotland.
This Order amends the table in the Schedule to the 2019 Order. It substitutes the entry in the table for the constituency of Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, as the figures have been revised as a result of further information from the constituency. It also adds a further entry (for the constituency of York Outer) which was omitted in error from the 2019 Order.
This instrument is issued free of charge to all known recipients of the defective instrument.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

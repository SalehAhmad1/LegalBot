The Secretary of State makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972(1).
The Secretary of State has been designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in relation to measures relating to food (including drink) including the primary production of food.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Secretary of State that it is expedient for any reference to an EU instrument defined in the Schedule to the Fishery Product (Official Controls Charges) (England) Regulations 2007(2) to be construed in accordance with regulation 2(3) of those Regulations as amended by these Regulations as a reference to that instrument as amended from time to time.
As required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(3) there has been open and transparent public consultation during the preparation of these Regulations.

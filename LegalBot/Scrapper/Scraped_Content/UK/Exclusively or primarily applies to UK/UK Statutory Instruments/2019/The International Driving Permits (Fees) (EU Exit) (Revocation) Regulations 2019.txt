19th September 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the International Driving Permits (Fees) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1) which conferred upon the Secretary of State the power to charge a £5.50 fee for the issue of international driving permits under the Convention on Road Traffic done at Vienna on 8th November 1968 (Cm 9570). That Statutory Instrument is now redundant following the coming into force of the Motor Vehicles (International Circulation) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/563) which amended the Motor Vehicles (International Circulation) Order 1975 (S.I. 1975/1208) to, amongst other things, confer the same charging power upon the Secretary of State.

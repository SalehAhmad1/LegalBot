(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes provision to enable the grant of immunities and privileges to the Bank for International Settlements and its governors, executive directors, alternates, officers and employees.
Article 2 amends section 12(3) of the International Development Act 2002 (c. 1) (the “2002 Act”) to add the Bank for International Settlements to the list of international financial institutions on which immunities and privileges may be conferred by an Order in Council made under section 12(1) of the 2002 Act.
Article 3 amends article 4 of the Immigration (Exemption from Control) Order 1972 (S.I 1972/1613) made under section 8(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77). The new provisions update legislative references, replacing references to repealed Acts with the 2002 Act and the International Monetary Fund Act 1979 (c. 29) (the “1979 Act”). New article 4(b) and (c) is to exempt persons entitled to immunity from legal process under an Order in Council made under section 12(1) of the 2002 Act or section 5(1) of the 1979 Act from immigration control under the Immigration Act 1971. The effect of the new provisions is to continue the exemptions from immigration control already in place, and to grant exemption from immigration control in respect of persons granted immunity from legal process under any future Order in Council made under section 12(1) of the IDA 2002.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact, on the private, public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

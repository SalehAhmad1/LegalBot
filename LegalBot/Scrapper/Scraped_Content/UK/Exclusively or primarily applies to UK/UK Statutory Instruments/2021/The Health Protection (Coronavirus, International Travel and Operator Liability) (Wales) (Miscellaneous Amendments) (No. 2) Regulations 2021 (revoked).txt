(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (the “International Travel Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Pre-Departure Testing and Operator Liability) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/48 (W. 11)) (the “Operator Liability Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales from non-exempt countries or territories to isolate for a period determined in accordance with those Regulations.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends Schedule 4 to the International Travel Regulations to update the list of specified sporting events. An individual is able to leave isolation to compete or train in, or provide coaching or other support to a person competing in a sporting event specified in Schedule 4.
The Operator Liability Regulations impose requirements on persons operating international passenger services (“operators”) arriving into Wales from outside the common travel area. In accordance with those requirements operators must, for example, ensure that passengers travelling on such services possess notification of a negative test result and have made arrangements to take further tests following their arrival.
Regulation 3 amends the Operator Liability Regulations so that an operator is not required to ensure that a passenger is in possession of a negative pre-departure test result, or has made arrangements to take tests following their arrival, if that passenger is being lawfully compelled to travel in the course of an extradition, prisoner transfer or deportation.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

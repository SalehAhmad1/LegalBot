(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Performers Lists) (England) Regulations 2013. Any GP offering primary care in an NHS setting is required to be registered on the medical performers list. Regulation 2 amends that requirement so that it does not apply to those who are administering a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine and any primary medical service ancillary to the administration of such a vaccine.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen and the instrument relates to emergency measures that are required for the coronavirus vaccination programme.

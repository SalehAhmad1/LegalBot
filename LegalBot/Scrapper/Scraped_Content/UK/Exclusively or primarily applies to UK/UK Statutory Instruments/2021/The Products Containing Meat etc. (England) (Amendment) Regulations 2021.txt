(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Products Containing Meat etc. (England) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3001) and the Food (Amendment and Transitional Provisions) (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/616).
Regulation 2 amends the Products Containing Meat etc. (England) Regulations 2014 to remove their expiry date, review clause and provisions that are no longer in force.
Regulation 3 amends the Food (Amendment and Transitional Provisions) (England) Regulations 2021 to extend the transitional period during which the requirements of the Products Containing Meat etc. (England) Regulations 2014 do not apply to certain imported meat products, so that the period ends with effect from 1st October 2022 rather than 12th December 2021. This brings the transitional period for these meat products in line with the transitional period applicable to other imported food products to which regulation 6 of the Food (Amendment and Transitional Provisions) (England) Regulations 2021 applies.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

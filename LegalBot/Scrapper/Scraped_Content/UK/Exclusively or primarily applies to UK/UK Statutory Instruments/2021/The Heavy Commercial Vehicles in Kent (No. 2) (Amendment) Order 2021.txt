(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 2) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/1394) (“the 2019 Order”).
Article 2(2) removes article 1(c) of the 2019 Order which provided that the 2019 Order would cease to have effect at the end of 31st October 2021. The 2019 Order therefore continues in force beyond that date.
Article 2(3) omits from article 3 of the 2019 Order:
(a)
paragraph (A1), which restricted the driving of a cross-Channel heavy commercial vehicle on the local road network in Kent (i.e. most roads in Kent except the motorway network) without a Kent Access Permit;
(b)
sub-paragraph (1)(b), which provided for cross-Channel heavy commercial vehicles to be excepted from the restriction on access to the local road network during a traffic restriction period where they were being used on the route between Manston Airfield and the Port of Dover and were displaying a permit; and
(c)
definitions that are no longer used.
Article 2(3) also amends the definition of “the relevant class of road” to remove roads leading to Manston Airfield and include other roads, such as those leading to the Sevington and Ebbsfleet Inland Border Facilities.
Article 2(4) amends a restriction on cross-Channel lorries using both lanes of specified dual carriageways to omit roads leading to Manston Airport.

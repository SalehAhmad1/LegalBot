The Queen’s Most Excellent Majesty in Council
This Order is made under the powers in section 179(1)(a) and (2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992(1) which provide that, for the purpose of giving effect to any agreement with the government of a country outside the United Kingdom providing for reciprocity in specified matters, Her Majesty may by Order in Council make provision for modifying or adapting specified legislation in its application to cases affected by such agreement.
At London on 9th September 2021 a Convention on Social Security Coordination between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Swiss Confederation(2) (“the Convention”) was signed on behalf of the respective Governments.

Article 73 provides that, pending entry into force of the Convention, the States may agree to provisionally apply the Convention by an exchange of notes through diplomatic channels. Provisional application of the Convention shall take effect on the day following the later of the States’ notes.
In order to give effect to the Convention, therefore, Her Majesty, in exercise of the powers conferred on Her by section 179(1)(a) and (2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and of all other powers enabling Her to do so, is pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to order as follows:

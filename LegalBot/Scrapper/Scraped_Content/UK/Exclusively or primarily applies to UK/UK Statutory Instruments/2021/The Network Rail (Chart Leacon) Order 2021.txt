(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 1 to the Network Rail (Chart Leacon) Order 2021 (“the 2021 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph (5)(8) of Schedule 1 to the 2021 Order) to acquire an interest in the land, and

Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act of 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 4 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 3(1) (power to acquire land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of rights under article 6(1) or (1) (power to acquire new rights)—

(a)
references to the appropriate Minister are references to the Secretary of State; and
(b)
references to land acquired or appropriated as mentioned in section 271(1) of the 1990 Act are references to land acquired or appropriated as mentioned in paragraph (1).
3.  Where any apparatus of public utility undertakers or of a public communications provider is removed in pursuance of a notice or order given or made under section 271, 272 or 273 of the 1990 Act, as applied by paragraph 1, any person who is the owner or occupier of premises to which a supply was given from that apparatus is entitled to recover from Network Rail compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of effecting a connection between the premises and any other apparatus from which a supply is given.
4.  Paragraph 3 does not apply in the case of the removal of a public sewer but where such a sewer is removed in pursuance of such a notice or order as is mentioned in that paragraph, any person who is—
(a)
the owner or occupier of premises the drains of which communicated with that sewer; or
(b)
the owner of a private sewer which communicated with that sewer,
is entitled to recover from Network Rail compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of making the drain or sewer belonging to that person communicate with any other public sewer or with a private sewerage disposal plant.
5.  The provisions of the 1990 Act mentioned in paragraph 1, as applied by that paragraph, do not have effect in relation to apparatus as respects which Part 2 of this Schedule or Part 3 of the 1991 Act applies.
6.  In this Schedule—
“public communications provider” has the same meaning as in section 151(1) of the 2003 Act(3); and

PART 2
APPARATUS OF STATUTORY UNDERTAKERS, ETC. IN STOPPED UP STREETS
7.  Where a street is stopped up under article 13 (street to be stopped up) any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, along or across that street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus, subject to the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, as if this Order had not been made.
8.  Where a street is stopped up under article 13 (street to be stopped up) any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, over, along or across that street may, and if reasonably requested to do so by Network Rail must—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in that other position.
9.  Subject to the following provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail must pay to any statutory utility an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the utility in or in connection with—

the execution of the relocation works required in consequence of the stopping up of the street; and
(b)
the doing of any other work or thing rendered necessary by the execution of the relocation works.
10.  If in the course of the execution of relocation works under paragraph 8—
(a)
apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of paragraph 9 is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.

13.  Paragraphs 9 to 12 do not apply where the authorised works constitute major transport works for the purposes of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act, but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of cost of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section; and
(b)

Acquisition of apparatus
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plan, Network Rail must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Alternative apparatus
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, Network Rail acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of an undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in question.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Network Rail requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the undertaker in question and Network Rail, or in default of such agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration).
(4) In any case where alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed under sub-paragraph (2), or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus, Network Rail must, subject to sub-paragraph (5), afford to the undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of Network Rail and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(5) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of Network Rail, or Network Rail is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (4) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Network Rail, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(6) The undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration), and after the grant to the undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (4) or (5), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by Network Rail to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(7) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (6), if Network Rail gives notice in writing to the undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of Network Rail, that work, instead of being executed by the undertaker, must be executed by Network Rail without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker.
(8) Nothing in sub-paragraph (7) authorises Network Rail to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail affords to an undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of Network Rail of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Network Rail and the undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of Network Rail, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Network Rail in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Network Rail to that undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Existing apparatus: protection and access
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2), Network Rail must submit to the undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and an officer of the undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by an undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If an undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by Network Rail, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to Network Rail of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Network Rail from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) Network Rail is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must repay to an undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any of the authorised works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule (other than apparatus that is re-used as alternative apparatus) is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an undertaker in respect of works under sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Any dispute as to whether a financial benefit is conferred in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or as to the amount of such financial benefit which cannot be agreed is to be determined in accordance with article 20 (arbitration).
Damage to apparatus: costs, losses, etc.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the authorised works any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of an undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided or in the supply of any goods by any undertaker, Network Rail must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on Network Rail with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of an undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) An undertaker must give Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of Network Rail which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Enactments and agreements
11.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and an undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Network Rail on the date on which this Order is made.

(a)
retain any notice of SGN’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land;
(b)
(where no such notice of SGN’s easement, right or other interest on the title exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register) include (with its application to register title to the undertaker’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry) a notice of SGN’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land and SGN must provide reasonable assistance to the undertaker to assist that registration; and
(c)
provide up to date official entry copies to SGN within 20 working days of receipt of such up to date official entry copies.
Removal of apparatus
21.—(1) If in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 20 or in any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of SGN to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation and the rights and facilities referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of SGN and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to SGN advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order SGN reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to SGN to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 22(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus);
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus); and
(c)
to allow access to that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus).
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, SGN may, on receipt of written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for SGN to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to so do.
(4) Any alterative apparatus to be constructed in land of, or land secured by the undertaker, under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between SGN and the undertaker.
(5) SGN must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to SGN of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) have been afforded to SGN to its satisfaction, then to proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
22.—(1) Where in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for SGN facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and SGN and must be no less favourable on the whole to SGN than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by SGN.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with SGN under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to SGN than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed (in SGN’s reasonable opinion) then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 29 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to SGN as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of SGN
23.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works, the undertaker must submit to SGN a plan and, if reasonably required by SGN, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to SGN under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)

any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply, until SGN has given written approval of the plans so submitted.
(4) Any approval of SGN required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (5) or (7); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (1) and/or (2) apply, SGN may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) or as relevant sub-paragraph (4), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and SGN and in accordance with all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and SGN will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works having given reasonable notice of their wish to do so.
(7) Where SGN requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to SGN’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If SGN in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 21(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act, but in that case it must give to SGN notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with—
(a)
the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances (where any such applicable conditions have been imposed at that time); and
(b)
sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(11) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised works the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that SGN retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 24.
Expenses
24.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to SGN on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by SGN in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or rights or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by SGN in connection with the negotiation or acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including professional fees) incurred by SGN as a consequence of SGN—

(g)
any watching brief pursuant to paragraph 23(6).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) or placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to SGN by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible or appropriate in the circumstances (including due to statutory or regulatory changes) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
Indemnity
25.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation, relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of SGN, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by SGN or SGN becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by SGN in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)

(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by SGN on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by SGN (save where that plan has been negligently approved by SGN) or in accordance with any requirement of SGN or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless SGN fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) or (2) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of SGN, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) SGN must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and its representations.

26.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between SGN and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and SGN in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
27.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or SGN requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 21(2) or SGN makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 23, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the authorised works, efficiently and in the interests of safety and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of SGN’s undertaking and SGN shall use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever SGN’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by SGN or the taking of action by SGN, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
28.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 20(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus) is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable SGN to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
29.  Any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and SGN under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and SGN, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration).
Notices
30.  The plans submitted to SGN by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 23(1) must be sent to SGN at easments@sgn.co.uk or such other address as SGN may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker.

34.  Regardless of any provisions in this Order or anything shown on the land plan or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker must not acquire any land interest or any apparatus or otherwise override any easement and/or other interest of the utility undertaker otherwise than by agreement, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Removal of apparatus
35.—(1) If, in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 34 or in any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of the utility undertaker to maintain or use that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased or acquired, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the utility undertaker at least 56 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order the utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker to its reasonable satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 36(1)) the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land and subsequently for the maintenance and use of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed with the undertaker’s assistance if reasonably required by the utility undertaker, save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for the utility undertaker to use its powers of compulsory acquisition.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 20, and subject to the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), then proceed and as soon as reasonably practicable to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, and the utility undertaker consents in writing to the execution of that work (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker, which shall include compliance by the undertaker with all relevant statutory requirements and the utility undertaker’s specifications and requirements relating to the execution of that work (and the utility undertaker shall be entitled to inspect such works to verify that they have been carried out in accordance with such requirements and specifications). At all times when carrying out any authorised works, the undertaker must comply with the utility undertaker’s policies for development near overhead lines and HSE’s guidance note 6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Lines”.
(7) If the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) and the utility undertaker does not respond to the notice within 56 days of receipt to confirm whether it consents to the execution of that work by the undertaker, the utility undertaker shall be deemed to have granted consent, subject to the superintendence of that work by the utility undertaker, if given, and to the works being carried out to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker, which shall include compliance by the undertaker with all relevant statutory requirements relating to the execution of that work.
(8) Nothing in sub-paragraphs (6) or (7) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, within 1 metre of other apparatus which does not form part of those works.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
36.—(1) Where in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures the utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction, use and maintenance and protection in land of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be no less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed, unless otherwise agreed by the utility undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with the utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus are less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject may be referred to arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration) of the Order and the arbitrator may make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to the utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case. In respect of the appointment of an arbitrator under this sub-paragraph article 20 (arbitration) of the Order shall apply.
Retained apparatus
37.—(1) Not less than 56 days before commencement of any authorised works that are in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that may affect, or is within 15 metres of, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 35(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker a plan of the works to be executed.

(3) In relation to any works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres of any part of the foundations of an electricity tower or between any two or more electricity towers, the plan to be submitted under sub-paragraph (1) must, in addition to these matters set out in sub-paragraph (2), include in the method statement—
(a)
the details of any cable trench design, including route, dimensions and clearance to pylons foundations;
(b)
a demonstration that pylon foundations will not be affected prior to, during and post construction;
(c)
the details of load bearing capacities of trenches;
(d)
the details of cable installation methodology, including access arrangements, jointing bays and backfill methodology;
(e)
written details of the operations and maintenance regime for the cable, including frequency and method access; and
(f)

(4) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) apply until the utility undertaker has given written approval of the plan submitted.
(5) Any approval of the utility undertaker required under sub-paragraph (2) or (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (6) or (8);

(6) Where the utility undertaker reasonably requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved, pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to the utility undertaker’s reasonable satisfaction, prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) to which sub-paragraph (1) applies and the utility undertaker shall give notice of the need for such protective works within 56 days from the date of receipt of a plan pursuant to sub-paragraph (1) (except in an emergency where no such notice will be required).
(7) If the utility undertaker, in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 35(2) provided always that the utility undertaker may require, following review of the information provided, the undertaker to enter into an asset protection agreement in a form required by the utility undertaker acting reasonably.
(8) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of any authorised works to which sub-paragraph (1) applies, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new pan.
(9) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must—

comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
comply with sub-paragraph (2) at all times.
Expenses and costs
38.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to the utility undertaker on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably and properly incurred by the utility undertaker in, or in connection with—
(a)
the inspection, removal, alteration, relaying, replacing or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in any of these provisions including without limitation—
(i)
any costs reasonably and properly incurred by or compensation paid by the utility undertaker in connection with the acquisition of facilities and rights or the exercise of statutory powers for any such apparatus in consequence of the operation of any of these provisions;
(ii)
the cost of the carrying out of any necessary diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus; and
(iii)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus, or the making safe of any redundant apparatus, in consequence of the exercise of any power conferred by this Order affecting the utility undertaker’s apparatus;
(b)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the superintendence and monitoring of works and the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the exercise of any power conferred by this Order affecting the utility undertaker’s apparatus;
(c)
the approval of plans;
(d)
the carrying out of protective works plus a proportionate capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(e)
the survey of any land, apparatus or work, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule; and
(f)
any other work or thing rendered reasonably necessary in consequence of the exercise of any power conferred by this Order affecting the utility undertaker’s apparatus.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated, after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
Compensation
39.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in any of these provisions or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default by the undertaker (or any person authorised by the undertaker) in the course of carrying out the works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of the utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by the utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by the utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply;
(b)
make reasonable compensation to the utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker; and
(c)
compensate the utility undertaker against all losses, claims, demands, proceedings, costs, damages, penalty and expenses which may be made or taken against or recovered from or incurred by, the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or the utility undertaker becoming liable to any third party.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by the utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by the utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of the utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of the utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) The utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representation.
(5) The utility undertaker must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which the compensation under sub-paragraph (1) applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, the utility undertaker shall provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised.
Co-operation
40.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or the utility undertaker requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 35(2) or the utility undertaker makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 37(6), the undertaker must use its best reasonable endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the authorised works efficiently and in the interests of safety and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the utility undertaker’s undertaking and the utility undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever the utility undertaker’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Enactments and agreements
41.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

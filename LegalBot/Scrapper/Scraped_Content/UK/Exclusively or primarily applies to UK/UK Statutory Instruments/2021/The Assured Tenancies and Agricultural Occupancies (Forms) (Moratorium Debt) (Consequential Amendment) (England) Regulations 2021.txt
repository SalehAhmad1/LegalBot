SCHEDULEEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Assured Tenancies and Agricultural Occupancies (Forms) (England) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/620) (“the principal Regulations”) and come into force on 4th May 2021.
The Regulations are consequential on the coming into force of the Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and Mental Health Crisis Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1311) (“the Moratorium Regulations”) which establishes a scheme which will give someone in problem debt the right to legal protections from their creditors for a period of 60 days in the case of a breathing space moratorium or, in the case of a mental health crisis moratorium, the duration of the mental health crisis treatment plus 30 days. In particular, it pauses any enforcement action such as serving a notice of intention to seek possession of the rented property.
These Regulations amend Form No. 3 in the Schedule to the principal Regulations to insert a reference to the legal protections offered by virtue of the Moratorium Regulations into that Form.

4.  If domestic aviation emissions in 2019 were—
(a)
greater than the domestic aviation cap, an amount of carbon units equal to the difference is to be credited to the net UK carbon account in respect of 2019;
(b)
less than the domestic aviation cap, an amount of carbon units equal to the difference is to be debited from the net UK carbon account in respect of 2019.Duty to cancel carbon units credited to the net UK carbon account in respect of 2019
5.—(1) The Secretary of State must, during a period beginning on 1st January 2023 and ending on 15th May 2024, ensure that each carbon unit credited to the net UK carbon account in respect of 2019 under regulation 5 of the 2009 Regulations is cancelled.
(2) A carbon unit is cancelled for the purpose of this regulation if an operation is performed in relation to it equivalent to the operation of cancellation or deletion under Commission Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 of 2 May 2013 establishing a Union Registry pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Decisions No 280/2004/EC and No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Commission Regulations (EU) No 920/2010 and No 1193/2011, as it had effect immediately before IP completion day(1).

SCHEDULE
The Domestic Aviation Cap
1.  For the purpose of this Schedule—
“EEA aviation emissions” means the emissions of carbon dioxide arising from any aircraft during taking off, flying and landing when the aerodrome from which the aircraft takes off and the aerodrome at which the aircraft next lands are both located in the same EEA State;
“EEA State” means a state which was an EEA state on 31st December 2019 (whether or not that state was an EEA state in the years referred to in sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) of paragraph 2).
2.  The domestic aviation cap (“DAC”), expressed in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, is calculated as follows—
where—
(a)
E is the arithmetic mean of the EEA aviation emissions for each of the years 2004, 2005 and 2006,
(b)
F is domestic aviation emissions for 2010, and
(c)
G is EEA aviation emissions for 2010.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for carbon accounting in respect of 2019 for the purposes of Part 1 of the Climate Change Act 2008 (c. 27) (“the Act”). They form part of the rules for determining the net UK carbon account – defined in section 27(1) of the Act. The amount of the net UK carbon account for different periods determines whether the targets in the Act for emissions reductions have been met. These Regulations are relevant to the third carbon budget set under the Act, by the Carbon Budgets Order 2009 (S.I. 2009/1259), covering 2018-2022.
Regulation 3 sets out the circumstances in which carbon units are to be credited to and debited from the net UK carbon account in respect of 2019 as a result of the operation of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme in that year other than in relation to aviation.
Regulation 4 sets out the circumstances in which carbon units are to be credited to and debited from the net UK carbon account to take into account domestic aviation emissions during 2019. It relies on the calculation of a domestic aviation cap in accordance with the Schedule.
Regulation 5 places a duty on the Secretary of State to cancel all the carbon units (if any) credited to the net UK carbon account in respect of 2019.
Regulation 6 amends the duty in regulation 9 of the Carbon Accounting Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/1257) (the “2009 Regulations”) on the Secretary of State to keep a register of carbon units credited to and debited from the net UK carbon account so that it takes account of these Regulations, and makes other minor amendments to facilitate future updates to the 2009 Regulations.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

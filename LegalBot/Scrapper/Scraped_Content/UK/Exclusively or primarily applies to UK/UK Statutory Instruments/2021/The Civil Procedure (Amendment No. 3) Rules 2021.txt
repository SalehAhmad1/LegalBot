(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998/3132) (“CPR”), by substituting cross-references to “Practice Direction 27A” for cross-references to “Practice Direction 27” in Part 27 of the Rules. These amendments are made in anticipation of the coming into force on 31st May 2021 of new Practice Direction 27B: Claims Under the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents – Court Procedure.
In addition, these Rules amend rule 6 of the Civil Procedure (Amendment No. 2) Rules 2021 (S.I. 2021/196), which amends rule 27.2 of the CPR, to correct a drafting error. Further amendments have been made to improve the grammar of the new provision which is inserted by rule 6.

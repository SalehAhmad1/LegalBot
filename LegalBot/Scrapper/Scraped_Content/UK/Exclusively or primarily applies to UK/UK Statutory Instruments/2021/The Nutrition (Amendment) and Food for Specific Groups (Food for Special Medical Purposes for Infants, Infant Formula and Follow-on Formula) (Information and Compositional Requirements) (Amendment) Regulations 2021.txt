The Secretary of State makes these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 16(1)(a) and (e) and (2)(b), 26(1) and (3) and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990(1) and now vested in him(2), and sections 8C(1)(c) and 23 of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018(3) (“the 2018 Act”).
The Secretary of State has had regard to relevant advice given by the Food Standards Agency in accordance with section 48(4A) of the Food Safety Act 1990(4).
The urgency of this matter does not allow for open and transparent public consultation through representative bodies as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(5), during the preparation and evaluation of these Regulations.

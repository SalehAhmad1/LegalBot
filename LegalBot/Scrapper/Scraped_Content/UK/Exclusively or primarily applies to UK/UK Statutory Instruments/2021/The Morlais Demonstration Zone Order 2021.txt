“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or a restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory, and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 26(3) (power to acquire subsoil only) of the Morlais Demonstration Zone Order 2021 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil only from this schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant,
(b)
the proposed use of the right or the restrictive covenant, and
(c)
if the right is proposed to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is proposed to be imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”
The 1981 Act
6.—(1) The 1981 Act, as applied by article 25 (application of the 1981 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 22 (power to acquire land), applies to a compulsory acquisition of a right or the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 23 (power to acquire new rights and impose restrictive covenants)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 7; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
(2) The enactments relating to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land also apply to a compulsory acquisition of a right or the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 23.
7.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 6(1)(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1981 Act to land are, in appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired or the restrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is, or is to be, exercisable, or over which the restrictive covenant is, or is to be, enforced.
(3) References in the 1981 Act to the 1965 Act are to be read as references to that Act as it applies to a compulsory acquisition of a right or the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 23.
(4) Section 8(1) of the 1981 Act (vesting, and right to enter and take possession) is modified so as to secure—
(a)
that a general vesting declaration in respect of any right vests the right or the restrictive covenant in the acquiring authority on the vesting date; and
(b)
that, as from the vesting date, the acquiring authority have power, exercisable in the same circumstances and subject to the same conditions, to enter land for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing the restrictive covenant as if the circumstances mentioned in section 8(1)(a) and (b) of the 1981 Act had arisen.
(5) Section 9(2) of the 1981 Act (right of entry under section 8(1) not exercisable in respect of land subject to certain tenancies, unless notice has been served on occupiers of the land) is modified so as to require a notice served by the appropriate authority under that provision to refer to the authority’s intention to enter land specified in the notice in order to exercise the right or enforce that restrictive covenant.
(6) In section 10(1) of the 1981 Act (acquiring authority’s liability on vesting of land), the reference to the acquiring authority’s taking possession of the land under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act is to be read instead as a reference to the authority’s exercising the power to enter the land under that provision as modified by paragraph 4(5) of this Schedule.
(7) Schedule A1 to the 1981 Act (counter-notice requiring purchase of land not in general vesting declaration) has effect as if—
(a)
in paragraph 1(1), for “part only of” there were substituted “only the acquisition of a right or the imposition of a restrictive covenant over”;
(b)
references to the land proposed to be acquired were (subject to paragraph (d) below) to the right proposed to be acquired or to the restrictive covenant proposed to be imposed;
(c)
references to the additional land were to the house, building or factory over which the right is proposed to be exercisable or the restrictive covenant to be enforceable;
(d)
in paragraphs 14 and 15, references to the severance of the land proposed to be acquired were to the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant; and
(e)
in paragraph 15, after “in addition to” there were inserted “or in substitution for”.

(4) Paragraph (3) does not apply in the case of the removal of a public sewer but where such a sewer is removed in pursuance of such a notice or order as is mentioned in that paragraph, any person who is—

(b)
the owner of a private sewer which communicated with that sewer,
will be entitled to recover from the undertaker compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by him, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of making his drain or sewer communicate with any other public sewer or with a private sewerage disposal plant.
(5) The provisions of the 1990 Act mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), as applied by that sub-paragraph, will not have effect in relation to apparatus as respects which paragraph 2 or Part 3 of the 1991 Act applies.

2.—(1) Where a street is stopped up under article 8 (temporary stopping up of streets) any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, along or across the street will have the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus, subject to the provisions of this paragraph, as if this Order had not been made.
(2) Where a street is stopped up under article 8 (temporary stopping up of streets) any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, over, along or across the street may, and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker must—
(a)

apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) will be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)—

(b)
the tidal works.
4.  Despite any provision in this Order or anything shown on the onshore plan, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
5.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed; and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3) afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part.
(6) Despite sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction, of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench), within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
6.—(1) Where, in accordance with this Part, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted on such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along the authorised project, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised project and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus that may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the undertaker; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the authorised project for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to the utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
7.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works of the type referred to in paragraph 5(2) that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under that sub-paragraph, the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it; and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of the works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the day on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker, in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 6 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 5(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency, but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
8.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by the utility undertaker in, or in connection with—
(a)
the inspection, removal and relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus under this Part (including any costs reasonably incurred or compensation properly paid in connection with the acquisition of rights or exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus);
(b)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus, or the making safe of any redundant apparatus, in consequence of the exercise by the undertaker of any power under this Order;
(c)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection, superintendence and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the exercise by the undertaker of any power under this Order; and
(d)
any other work or thing rendered reasonably necessary in consequence of the exercise by the undertaker of any such power,
within a reasonable time of being notified by the utility undertaker that it has incurred such expenses.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under this Part, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with this Part—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of subparagraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount that represents that benefit.
9.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works referred to in paragraph 5(2) any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided by the utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by the utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to the utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, must have the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
10.  Nothing in this Part affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker at the date on which this Order is made.

(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signalmen, watchmen and other persons whom it is reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions that may, in the opinion of the engineer, be required to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or from the substitution or diversion of services that may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work.
21.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the onshore works where such interference is of a level that adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus;
“Network Rail’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the onshore works) that are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 5(1) for the relevant part of the onshore works giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised project take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus that may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 5(1)) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can reasonably be prevented only by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 5(1) has effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) If, at any time before commencement of regular operation of the onshore works and notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing or commissioning of the authorised project causes EMI, the undertaker must immediately on receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5) to Network Rail’s apparatus).
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI; and
(c)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus or such EMI.
(8) Where Network Rail approves modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus pursuant to subparagraph (5) or (6)—
(a)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
(b)
any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus approved pursuant to those subparagraphs must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 16.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 25(1) applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses suffered by Network Rail through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Network Rail’s apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which subparagraph (6) applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 20(1) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph is deemed to be protective works referred to in that sub-paragraph.
(11) In relation to any dispute arising under this paragraph the reference in article 49 (arbitration) to the Institution of Civil Engineers shall be read as a reference to the Institution of Engineering and Technology.
22.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.
23.  The undertaker must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Network Rail unless it has first consulted Network Rail and it must comply with Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.
24.  Any additional expenses that Network Rail may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the undertaker, be repaid by the undertaker to Network Rail.
25.—(1) The undertaker must pay to Network Rail all reasonable costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part that may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)
by reason of the construction or maintenance of a specified work or its failure; or
(b)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged on a specified work; and the undertaker must indemnify Network Rail and keep Network Rail indemnified from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or any such failure, act or omission; and the fact that any act may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision does not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under this Part.

25th January 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The amendments made by these Regulations are to further refine the traffic sign and marking requirements for roads in local areas hosting electric scooter trials, to assist the smooth running of trials of electric scooters and therefore to inform assessment of their suitability for use on roads in the future.
Regulation 2(2) makes amendments to the Traffic Signs Regulations 2016 to amend the meanings, in Schedule 1 of “cycle lane” and “bus lane” for electric scooter trials. Supplementary amendments have been made to other Schedules to those Regulations to clarify that signs relating to pedal cycles, also apply to electric scooters being used in a trial, and also to distinguish, where required, how a sign may apply differently to a solo motor cycle and electric scooter being used in a trial. Further amendments have been made to clarify the road markings required for a way that would be a cycle track, but for being subject to an order under section 9 or 14 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
A targeted consultation was carried out with trialling areas to inform the amendments made by these Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

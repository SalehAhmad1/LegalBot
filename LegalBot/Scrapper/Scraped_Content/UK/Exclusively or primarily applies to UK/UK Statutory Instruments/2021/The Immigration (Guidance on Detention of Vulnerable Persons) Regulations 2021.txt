(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force revised guidance specifying matters to be taken into account in determining whether a person would be particularly vulnerable to harm if that person were to be detained or to remain in immigration detention and, if so, whether that person should be detained or remain in immigration detention.
The revised guidance replaces the guidance entitled “Immigration Act 2016: Revised guidance on adults at risk in immigration detention” which was brought into force on 2nd July 2018 by the Immigration (Guidance on Detention of Vulnerable Persons) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/410).
The draft revised guidance on adults at risk in immigration detention is published by the Stationery Office and copies may be obtained from the Stationery Office bookshops or online shop, with final guidance to be available in the same way. The draft guidance is also available on the adults at risk in immigration detention pages of the gov.uk website, with final guidance to be available in the same way.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

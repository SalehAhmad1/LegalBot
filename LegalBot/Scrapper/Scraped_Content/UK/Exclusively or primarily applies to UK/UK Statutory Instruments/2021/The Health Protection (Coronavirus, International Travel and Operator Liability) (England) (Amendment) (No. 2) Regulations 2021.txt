(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021 (“the International Travel Regulations”).
Regulations 3 and 4 have the effect that persons arriving in England intending to stay for short periods of time must nevertheless obtain testing packages in the same manner as those visiting for longer periods.
Regulation 5 amends regulation 21 of the International Travel Regulations to identify the offences which may be prosecuted.
Regulations 6 and 7 amend Schedules 1 and 3 to the International Travel Regulations to amend the lists of places designated as category 1 (“green-list”) and category 3 (“red-list”) countries and territories.
Regulation 8 adds London Biggin Hill Airport to the list of ports at which persons who have been in or transited through red-list countries or territories within the previous 10 days may arrive.
Regulation 9 permits direct flights from countries and territories designated as red-list countries and territories to land in England at Birmingham or Heathrow Airport. The airport operator must ensure that passengers from these flights arrive at designated terminals in those airports, separate from passengers arriving from other countries or territories apart from other passengers who have been in or transited through red-list countries or territories within the previous 10 days.

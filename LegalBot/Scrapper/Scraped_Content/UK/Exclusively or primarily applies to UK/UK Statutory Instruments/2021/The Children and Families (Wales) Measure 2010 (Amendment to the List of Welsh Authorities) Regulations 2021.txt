(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Children and Families (Wales) Measure 2010 (“the Measure”) requires Welsh authorities to make and demonstrate their contribution towards the eradication of child poverty in Wales.
These Regulations add corporate joint committees established by regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (“the 2021 Act”) to the list of Welsh authorities subject to the duty to prepare and publish a strategy for contributing to the eradication of child poverty in Wales and who have to have regard to guidance or directions given under the Measure by Welsh Ministers.
These Regulations are connected with regulations which established certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the 2021 Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which established corporate joint committees and connected regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

At 10.05 a.m. on 1 December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Children and Families (Wales) Measure 2010 (“the Measure”) makes provision about Welsh authorities contributing to the eradication of Child poverty in Wales.
Corporate joint committees established by regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (“the Act”) are Welsh authorities for the purpose of the Measure.
These Regulations set out the period of time to which a child poverty strategy prepared by a corporate joint committee relates, when the strategy should be renewed, when and how the strategy should be published and how it can be inspected.
These Regulations also amend the Child Poverty Strategy (Wales) Regulations 2011 by disapplying those Regulations to corporate joint committees.
These Regulations are connected with regulations which established certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected orders and regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made by the Treasury further to Part 1 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (c. 22). This is an EU Exit statutory instrument.
Regulation 1 provides for citation and commencement. These Regulations come into force on 1st July 2021.
Regulation 2 makes various amendments to the Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1248). Regulations 2(2) and (3) extend the transitional EIDR simplified Customs declaration process to goods imported between 1st July 2021 and 31 December 2021. Regulation 2(4) extends the period for making a supplementary declaration under the EIDR procedure in relation to a fixed transport installation, where that declaration is to be made within the timescale specified in a notice published by HMRC, to entries made in the operator’s commercial records between 1st July 2021 and 31 December 2021.
Regulation 3 amends the Customs (Export) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/108) so that the value threshold for posted goods for which export declarations may be made by conduct is increased from £900 to £1000.
Regulation 4 amends the Value Added Tax (Miscellaneous and Transitional Provisions, Amendment and Revocation) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1495) to extend the timeframe in which the use of the VAT return for postponed import VAT accounting is mandated for VAT registered businesses using the transitional EIDR simplified Customs declaration process to the 31 December 2021.

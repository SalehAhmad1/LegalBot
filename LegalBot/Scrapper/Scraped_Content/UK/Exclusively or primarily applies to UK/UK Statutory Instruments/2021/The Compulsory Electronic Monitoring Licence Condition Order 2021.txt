This Order requires an electronic monitoring condition to be included in the licence of persons described in the Order pursuant to section 62A of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 (c. 43) (“the 2000 Act”).
Article 2 of this Order describes the persons to which it applies (defined in Article 1 as a “qualifying offender”), by reference to: the date of release; the type, length and release provisions of sentence; the offence (limited to those listed in Schedule 2); the period on licence following release; whether required to reside on licence at an address within a specified police area (limited to those listed in Schedule 1); previous inclusion of an electronic monitoring condition in accordance with the Order; and whether, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State, the person is not otherwise unsuitable for electronic monitoring.
Article 3 of this Order requires that an electronic monitoring condition must be included in the licence of a qualifying offender. An “electronic monitoring condition” is defined in section 62 of the 2000 Act.
Article 4 of this Order specifies the date from when the electronic monitoring condition will be included in a qualifying offender’s licence and the period that such condition will remain in the licence.

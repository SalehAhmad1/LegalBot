(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Registration of Births and Deaths Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/2088) (“the 1987 Regulations”) to enable the use of electronic communications and storage for certain documents used in connection with the registration of births and deaths. The Births and Deaths Registration (Electronic Communications and Electronic Storage) Order 2021 (S.I. 2021/1231)(“the 2021 Order”), introduced electronic methods of communication and storage in connection with the process of registration of births and deaths.
These Regulations enable certain declarations, certificates and other documents prescribed by the 1987 Regulations to be in an electronic form approved by the Registrar General. These Regulations also enable any notice, information, declaration, certificate, return or other document required to be given, sent, delivered, produced, supplied, transmitted or otherwise provided for any purpose under the 1987 Regulations to be provided by sending that document, or a copy of it, in an electronic form approved by the Registrar General.
The effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is outlined in the impact assessment prepared for the 2021 Order, available from www.legislation.gov.uk . Hard copies can be obtained by writing to the Registration Services Team, General Register Office, Smedley Hydro, Trafalgar Road, Birkdale, Southport PR8 2HH.

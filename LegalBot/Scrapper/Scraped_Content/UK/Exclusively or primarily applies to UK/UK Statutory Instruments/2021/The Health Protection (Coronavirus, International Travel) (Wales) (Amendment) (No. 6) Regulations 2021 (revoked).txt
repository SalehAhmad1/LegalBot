(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (the “International Travel Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales to isolate for a period determined in accordance with those Regulations.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 6B of the International Travel Regulations to exempt a person arriving in Wales from a country or territory subject to additional measures, who has travelled to the United Kingdom for the purpose of transporting certain materials to be used for the provision of a health service by a provider of health services, from the requirement to arrange tests before their arrival.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 6K of the International Travel Regulations to apply the provisions on workforce testing to certain health or care workers arriving in Wales from a country or territory subject to additional measures to undertake employment.
Regulation 5 amends regulation 12E of the International Travel Regulations so as to allow entry into Wales for those two categories of person.
Regulation 6 amends Schedule 3A to the International Travel Regulations, which contains the list of countries and territories subject to additional measures in Wales. Regulation 6 adds India to the list.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

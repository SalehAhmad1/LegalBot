29th April 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides approval for Transport for London to enable it to require the payment of charges in accordance with the new Transport for London Lane Rental Scheme which was submitted to the Secretary of State on the 13th January 2021 (“the Scheme”).
The requirement to pay charges to an Approved Authority is set out in the Street Works (Charges for Occupation of the Highway) (England) Regulations 2012 (S.I 2012/425) (“the 2012 Regulations”).
The Scheme is designed to control the carrying out of works in specified traffic sensitive locations at traffic sensitive times. This will be achieved by requiring the payment of a charge, in accordance with the 2012 Regulations, for each day that the street is occupied by the works.
The Scheme replaces the previous Transport for London Lane Rental Scheme that was approved in 2012 and this Order revokes the Street Works (Charges for Occupation of the Highway) (Transport for London) Order 2012 (S.I 2012/1322) that provided approval for Transport for London to require the payment of charges in accordance with that Scheme.
The Scheme provides for transitional arrangements for activities which started, or had been notified to Transport for London, prior to the commencement date of the Scheme.
A copy of the Scheme can be inspected at the offices of Transport for London, Palestra House, Network Management, 197 Blackfriars Road, London, SE1 8NJ. It is also available on the Transport for London website at www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/urban-planning-and-construction/our-land-and-infrastructure/lane-rental-scheme.

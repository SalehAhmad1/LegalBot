The whole RegulationsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce new provisions and consolidate existing legislation which exempts the establishment, installation and use of certain radio equipment which comply with certain terms, provisions and limitations, from the requirement to be licensed under section 8(1) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (c. 36).
Regulation 4 exempts the establishment, installation and use of short-range devices, subject to certain terms and limitations set out in the new Interface Requirements published in 2021.
These Regulations also consolidate existing legislation by revoking previous regulations (the revocation is in regulation 3) and by exempting (in regulations 5 to 9) the establishment, installation and use of fixed wireless systems, high-density fixed satellite service systems, personal locator beacons, earth stations on mobile platforms, and citizens' band radio equipment, which comply with certain technical requirements, from the requirement to be licenced under section 8(1) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (c 36).
Technical requirements are set out in Interface Requirement documents. The Interface Requirements are published by OFCOM and available from OFCOM's website at https://www.ofcom.org.uk or from the OFCOM library at Riverside House, 2a Southwark Bridge Road, London, SE1 9HA.
A full regulatory impact assessment of the effect that these Regulations will have on costs to business is available to the public from OFCOM's website at https://www.ofcom.org.uk or from the OFCOM library at Riverside House, 2a Southwark Bridge Road, London, SE1 9HA. Copies of the assessment have also been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

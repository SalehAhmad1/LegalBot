17 March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The purpose of Part 2 of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 (“the Act”) is to require the Welsh Ministers to meet targets for reducing net Welsh emissions of greenhouse gases from Wales. Section 29 places a duty upon the Welsh Ministers to ensure that net Welsh emissions for the year 2050 are at least 100% lower than the baseline emissions figures.
Section 31(1) of the Act requires that the Welsh Ministers set carbon budgets for each 5-year budgetary period between 2016 and 2050. Section 32(1)(b) requires that each carbon budget set by the Welsh Ministers is set at a level consistent with meeting the 2050 emissions target and the interim emissions target for any interim target year that falls within or after that budgetary period.
Regulation 2 amends the carbon budget for the budgetary period 2021-2025 so it is limited to an average of 37% lower than the baseline.
Regulation 3 sets the carbon budget for the budgetary period 2026-2030 so it is limited to an average of 58% lower than the baseline.
In accordance with section 32 of the Act, the Welsh Ministers in drafting these Regulations have had regard to the factors listed in section 32(3).
In accordance with section 49 of the Act, the Welsh Ministers have obtained and taken into account the advice of the advisory body before laying draft regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

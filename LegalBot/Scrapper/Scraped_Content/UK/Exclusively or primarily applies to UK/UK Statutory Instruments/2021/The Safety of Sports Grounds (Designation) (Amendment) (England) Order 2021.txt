(This is not part of the Order)
By section 1 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (c. 52) (“the Act”), the Secretary of State may designate as a sports ground requiring a safety certificate under that Act any sports ground which, in the Secretary of State’s opinion, has accommodation for more than the specified number of spectators.
This Order amends Schedule 1 to the Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/661) to de-designate Twerton Park (occupied by Bath City Football Club) and Blundell Park (occupied by Grimsby Town Football Club) because they no longer satisfy the conditions which would entitle the Secretary of State to designate them as requiring safety certificates under section 1 of the Act.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

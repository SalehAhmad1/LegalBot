The Secretary of State makes these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 45B, 45C(1) and (3)(c), 45F(2) and 45P(2) of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984(1).

7th June 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Testing Requirements and Standards) (England) Regulations 2020 (“the Testing Requirements Regulations”). Regulation 2 introduces new steps in the process by which private providers of Covid-19 diagnostic testing must become accredited by the National Accreditation Body for the United Kingdom (UKAS) and extends the final date in the Testing Requirements Regulations by which accreditation must be completed.
Regulation 3 amends the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021. Regulation 3(1) amends Schedule 8 to modify the application of regulation 6 of the Testing Requirements Regulations to private providers of mandatory testing after arrival in England, so that those providers only have to make one declaration of compliance to the Department. Regulation 3(2) amends Schedule 10 to apply the same accreditation process to providers of Covid-19 diagnostic testing which permits international arrivals in certain circumstances to determine whether they may cease self-isolating.

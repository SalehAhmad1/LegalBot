(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the recommendations of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”), which reported in November 2020 on its review of the electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Caerphilly. The Commission’s Report proposed a reduction in the number of electoral wards, from 33 to 30, and a reduction in the number of councillors from 73 to 69.
This Order implements the Commission’s recommendations, with modifications.
Article 3 of this Order abolishes the existing electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Caerphilly and introduces the Schedule, which sets out the new electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Caerphilly.
This Order also implements recommendations for changes to the electoral arrangements for some communities within the County Borough of Caerphilly.
Article 4 makes changes to the boundaries between the community wards of Pontlottyn, Moriah and Twyn Carno within the community of Rhymney.
Article 5 sets out the number of members to be elected for the St David’s and Twyn Carno wards of the community of Rhymney.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.
Prints of the map to which article 4 of this Order relates are deposited in the office of the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ (Local Government Democracy Division), and with Caerphilly County Borough Council. Prints deposited with Caerphilly County Borough Council are open to inspection by anyone affected by the provisions of this Order.

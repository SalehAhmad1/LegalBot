(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into force (in Northern Ireland) section 143 of, and paragraph 14 of Schedule 18 to, the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (c. 41) (“the 2000 Act”).
These provisions were commenced across the United Kingdom on 16th February 2001 by S.I. 2001/222. However, that commencement was deemed not to have had effect by section 1 of the Election Publications Act 2001 (c. 5) (“the 2001 Act”). The 2001 Act provided for the provisions to be brought into force on a day appointed by the Secretary of State. Section 143, and paragraph 14 of Schedule 18, to the 2000 Act were commenced for England, Wales and Scotland by S.I. 2006/3416.
Section 143 of the 2000 Act requires that advertisements and other election material designed to promote or procure the electoral success of a registered party or candidates who hold particular opinions must include certain specified information. In Northern Ireland, section 143 applies to Parliamentary elections, Northern Ireland Assembly elections and local elections.
Paragraph 14 of Schedule 18 of the 2000 Act substitutes section 110 of the 1983 Act. Section 110 is concerned with the information that must appear on election publications intended to promote or procure the election of a particular candidate. In Northern Ireland, section 110 applies to Parliamentary elections but is also applied to Northern Ireland Assembly elections by S.I. 2001/2599.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT ORDERS

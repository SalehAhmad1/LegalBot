section 265 M1 (transfer of property and liabilities upon a highway becoming or ceasing to be a trunk road) of the 1980 Act applies in respect of that highway; and
(b)
any alterations to that highway undertaken under powers conferred by this Order prior to and in connection with that de-trunking must, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from the date of completion.
(5) Where a highway described in Part 2B (roads to be de-trunked and remain under the control and management of the undertaker) of Schedule 3 to this Order is de-trunked under this Order, section 265(7) of the 1980 Act does not apply in respect of that de-trunking, and the undertaker shall remain the highway authority for the highway in question.
(6) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a trunk road) over or under a trunk road, the highway surface must from its completion be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority and the structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker.
(7) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a trunk road) over another highway which is not a trunk road, both the highway surface and the structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from the date of their completion.
(8) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(9) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (8), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.
(10) Any street formed on the Order land which is not open to vehicular use by the public, and which is used by the undertaker for the purposes of maintaining the authorised development, must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker or any successor in function, as the landowner of the land on which the street is situated.

protective works are carried out under this article to a building; and
(b)
within the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which the part of the authorised development carried out in the vicinity of the building is first opened for use it appears that the protective works are inadequate to protect the building against damage caused by the carrying out or use of that part of the authorised development,
the undertaker must compensate the owners and occupiers of the building for any loss or damage sustained by them.

(a)
underpinning, strengthening and any other works the purpose of which is to prevent damage which may be caused to the building by the carrying out, maintenance or use of the authorised development; and

(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or

the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.

(5) Section 11 M2 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restriction, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 23), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A M3 (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B M4 (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12 M5 (unauthorised entry) and 13 M6 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 M7 (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 29(4) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND NOT IN NOTICE TO TREAT
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or a restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 30 (application of the 1981 Act) of the A303 Sparkford to Ilchester Dualling Development Consent Order 2021 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 31(3) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the A303 Sparkford to Ilchester Dualling Development Consent Order 2021 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right of the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making the determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawing of the notice.
15.  Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker's apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days' written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 45 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 45 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.

(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

9.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) are to be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker, in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres measured in any direction of any electricity apparatus, the plan to be submitted to the utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) must be detailed, include a method statement and describe—

the level at which they are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)

(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 45 (arbitration) to be necessary then, if such placing involves cost exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and

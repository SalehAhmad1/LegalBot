(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order designates the Cayman Islands, the Republic of North Macedonia, Taiwan, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates, under section 108(2)(b) of the Road Traffic Act 1988, as making satisfactory provision for the issue of certain classes of driving licences. This enables a person holding one of these licences to exchange it for a corresponding British licence.
The licences affected in the cases of the Cayman Islands and the United Arab Emirates are those authorising the driving of mopeds, light motorcycles, motor cars and small goods vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes maximum authorised mass (with or without a trailer), tractors, pedestrian controlled vehicles and mowing machines. The licences affected in the cases of the Republic of North Macedonia, Taiwan, and Ukraine are those authorising the driving of motor cars and small goods vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes maximum authorised mass (with or without a trailer), tractors, pedestrian controlled vehicles and mowing machines.
The Order also provides that a licence may not be exchanged for a British licence authorising the driving of vehicles with manual transmission unless the holder took a driving test on a vehicle with manual transmission. If the test was taken in a vehicle with automatic transmission, it will be exchangeable only so far as the licence authorises the driving of vehicles with automatic transmission.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

15 June 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order varies the Spring Traps Approval (Wales) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/18) (W. 7).
Under section 8 of the Pests Act 1954 (c. 68), it is an offence to use or knowingly permit the use of any spring trap, other than a trap that has been approved by order, for animals or in circumstances for which it is not approved.
This Order adds a type of spring trap to those approved for use in Wales, namely, the Perdix Spring Trap (article 2(c)).
It updates the address of Goodnature Ltd who manufacture traps and adds to the target species for which two of the traps previously approved may be used:
the Goodnature A24 Rat and Stoat Trap may now also be used for edible dormice (Glis glis) (article 2(b)), and
the Tully Trap may now also be used for grey squirrels, where it is fitted with baffles for grey squirrels, in accordance with the conditions specified (article 2(d)).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

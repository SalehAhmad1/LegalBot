Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1
The Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 45C(1) and (3)(c), 45D, 45F(2), 45P and 45T(6) of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 M1, makes the following Regulations.

The Secretary of State considers that the restrictions and requirements imposed by the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020 M2 as amended by these Regulations are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public response to that threat.
In accordance with section 45R of that Act, the Secretary of State is of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.

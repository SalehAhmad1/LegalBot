17 March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004 (c. 23) confers additional functions on the Auditor General for Wales, (the office of Auditor was established by section 90 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 (c. 38) – now superseded by section 145 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32)), including making provision about the audit of accounts of public bodies in Wales.
Section 12(1) of the 2004 Act lists the local government bodies in Wales to which Part 2 of that Act applies. Section 12(2) of that Act enables the Welsh Ministers, by Order, to amend that list.
This Order adds corporate joint committees established by Regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 to the list in section 12(1) of the 2004 Act. The Order also makes minor consequential and supplementary provision.
Corporate joint committees are bodies corporate consisting of such local authorities in Wales as are specified in Regulations establishing a corporate joint committee and, in some circumstances, National Park authorities in Wales if those Regulations make provision to that effect.
This Order is connected with Regulations which establish certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021. The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the Regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected orders and regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

(b)
entitlement to that guaranteed minimum pension arises from an employment from which (either directly, or indirectly by virtue of the payment of a transfer credit) entitlement to the official pension also arises;
the amount by reference to which any increase is calculated for the purposes of article 3(2) must be reduced by an amount equal to the rate of the guaranteed minimum pension unless the Treasury otherwise direct in accordance with the provisions of section 59A of the Act(1).
(2) Where on the death of a deceased spouse or civil partner a person becomes entitled to a guaranteed minimum pension in relation to a surviving spouse’s pension or a surviving civil partner’s pension, the amount by reference to which any increase is calculated for the purposes of article 3(2) must be reduced in accordance with section 59(5ZA) of the Act.

8th March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Under section 59 of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 (c.60) where the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, under the Social Security Administration Act 1992 Act (c.5), directs the sums in section 150(1)(c) are to be increased by a specified percentage, the Treasury shall provide by order for the increase in the rates of public service pensions. The Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 (c.56) defines certain terms and sets out when a pension “begins” (the day after the last day of service in respect of which the pension is payable) and how the increase applies to lump sums.
The increase is the percentage by which the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has, by direction under section 151(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (c.5), increased the additional pension entitlements accruing to employees in respect of earnings after 5th April 1978.
For pensions which began before 6th April 2020 the increase is 0.50 per cent. For pensions which began on or after 6th April 2020 the increases (following the calculation set out in article 3) are as follows—
Pensions Beginning Pensions increase
6th April 2020 to 27th April 2020 0.50%
28th April 2020 to 27th May 2020 0.46%
28th May 2020 to 27th June 2020 0.42%
28th June 2020 to 27th July 2020 0.38%
28th July 2020 to 27th August 2020 0.33%
28th August 2020 to 27th September 2020 0.29%
28th September 2020 to 27th October 2020 0.25%
28th October 2020 to 27th November 2020 0.21%
28th November 2020 to 27th December 2020 0.17%
28th December 2020 to 27th January 2021 0.13%
28th January 2021 to 27th February 2021 0.08%
28th February 2021 to 27th March 2021 0.04%
Article 4 of the Order provides for increases on certain deferred lump sums which become payable on or after 6th April 2020 and before 12th April 2021.
The Order also makes provision for the amount by reference to which any increase in the rate of an official pension is to be calculated to be reduced by the amount equal to the rate of the guaranteed minimum pension entitlement deriving from the employment which gives rise to the official pension.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes changes to electoral arrangements for St Albans following recommendations made by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. The area of St Albans remains unchanged.
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral wards of St Albans and replaces them with 20 new ones for the purpose of elections held on or after the ordinary day of election of councillors in England in 2022. It establishes the names and areas of the new electoral wards and the number of councillors for each.
Article 4 makes provision for a whole council election in 2022. Subsequently, the council will revert to the existing system of election by thirds. That article also provides for the order of retirement of councillors in 2023, 2024 and 2026 and the election of their replacements.
Article 5 makes changes to parish wards which are consequential on the changes made by article 3. The changes to parish wards introduced by article 5 come into force for the purpose of parish elections in 2023.
The area covered by each ward created by this Order is identified on a map which is available for inspection at reasonable times at the offices of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, 1st Floor, Windsor House, 50 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0TL.

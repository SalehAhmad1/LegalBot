(2)
Section 5(1A) was inserted by paragraph 16 of Schedule 9 to the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 (c. 19).EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/89 (W. 13)) (“the 2020 Regulations”) to apply the law that existed before 21 February 2021 in relation to infant formula and follow-on formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates from 16 September 2021 until 22 February 2022.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 5 of the 2020 Regulations to disapply regulations 2 to 4 of the 2020 Regulations from infant formula and follow-on formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates.
Regulation 2 also inserts a new Schedule 4 into the 2020 Regulations. New Schedule 4 contains the regulatory regime that applied to infant formula and follow-on formula manufactured from protein hydrolysates prior to 21 February 2021.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

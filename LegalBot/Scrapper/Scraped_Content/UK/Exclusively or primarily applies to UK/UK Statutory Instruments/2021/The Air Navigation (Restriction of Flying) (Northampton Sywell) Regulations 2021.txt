EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
The Light Aircraft Association Rally 2021, and associated preparations, will take place at 
Northampton Sywell aerodrome, Northamptonshire between 2nd and 5th September 2021 
(inclusive). The event will attract a large number of aircraft on each day, many using limited radio 
transmissions in an area of intense aerial activity and therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and 
Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in the vicinity of the displays for 
reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(2) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr S J Maxted, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 383216.

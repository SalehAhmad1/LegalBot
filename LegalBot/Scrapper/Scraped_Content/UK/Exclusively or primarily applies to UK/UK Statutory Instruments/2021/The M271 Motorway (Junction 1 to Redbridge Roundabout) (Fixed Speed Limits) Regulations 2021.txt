(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce fixed speed limits on the M271 motorway in the vicinity of junction 1. The carriageway southbound from junction 1 (and part of the on-slip road joining it) is subject to a 50mph speed limit until it nears the end of the motorway when a 40mph speed limit then applies.
Contravention of these Regulations is an offence under section 17(4) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations as no significant impact on the cost of business or the voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

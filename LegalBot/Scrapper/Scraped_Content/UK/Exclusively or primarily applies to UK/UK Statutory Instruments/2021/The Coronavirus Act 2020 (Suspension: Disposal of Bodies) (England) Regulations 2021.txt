(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations suspend three parts of a Schedule to the Coronavirus Act 2020 (c. 7) (“the Act”).
Regulation 2 suspends Parts 1 and 4 and 5 of Schedule 28, which provide powers to require information about capacity for the storage of dead bodies to address insufficient capacity to deal with transportation, storage or disposal of dead bodies or other human remains. These Parts extend and apply across the United Kingdom but are being suspended only in England. The suspension of the operation of these provisions means that they no longer have effect in England while the suspension remains in place. Having been suspended, these provisions are capable of being revived by regulations made under section 88(3) of the Act.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

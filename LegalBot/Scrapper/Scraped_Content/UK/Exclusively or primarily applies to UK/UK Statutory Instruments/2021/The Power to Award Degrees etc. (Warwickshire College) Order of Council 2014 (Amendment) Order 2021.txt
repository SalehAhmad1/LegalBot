(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, made under section 45(1) of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, provides for a variation of the Power to Award Degrees etc. (Warwickshire College) Order of Council 2014, so that Warwickshire College’s existing foundation Degree Awarding Powers authorisation remains valid for an indefinite period. This Order also removes the restrictions stated in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Power to Award Degrees etc. (Warwickshire College) Order of Council 2014 so that Warwickshire College may now authorise other institutions to grant awards on its behalf and so that Warwickshire College may grant awards to persons who were not enrolled at the institution at the time they completed the course of study for which the award is granted. This Order authorises Warwickshire College to grant awards up to and including bachelor’s degree awards for a fixed term expiring 31st December 2024. This Order will come into force on 1st September 2021.

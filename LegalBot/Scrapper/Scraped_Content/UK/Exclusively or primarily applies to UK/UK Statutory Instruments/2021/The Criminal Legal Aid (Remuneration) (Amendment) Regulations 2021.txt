(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Criminal Legal Aid (Remuneration) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/435) (the “Remuneration Regulations”).
The Remuneration Regulations provide for the remuneration of litigators and advocates in respect of advice, assistance and representation made available under sections 13, 15 and 16 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (c. 10). In particular, the Remuneration Regulations make provision for payments in respect of the consideration of unused material under both the advocates’ graduated fee scheme (as set out in Schedule 1) and the litigators’ graduated fee scheme (as set out in Schedule 2).
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the fees payable in respect of the consideration of unused material in the advocates’ graduated fee scheme and the litigators’ graduated fee scheme, and Regulation 3 is a savings provision.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

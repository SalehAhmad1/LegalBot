EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in airspace in the vicinity of Loch Long and the 
Firth of Clyde by reason of the intended movement of the aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth 
that is scheduled between 15th March and 21st March 2021 (inclusive). The Civil Aviation 
Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in the vicinity of 
the event for reasons of public safety and security. 
These Regulations also revoke the Air Navigation (Restriction of Flying) (Loch Long and the 
Firth of Clyde) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/301), which would have imposed similar restrictions 
from 14th March 2021 to 20th March 2021. This is in consequence of a change in the proposed 
dates for the movement of the aircraft carrier. In replacing those Regulations, some other minor 
defects have also been corrected. 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 2(4)(e), the Police Scotland Aviation Safety 
and Security Unit at Glasgow Airport may be contacted on telephone number 01786 895840 or by 
emailing OSDAviationSafety@scotland.pnn.police.uk.

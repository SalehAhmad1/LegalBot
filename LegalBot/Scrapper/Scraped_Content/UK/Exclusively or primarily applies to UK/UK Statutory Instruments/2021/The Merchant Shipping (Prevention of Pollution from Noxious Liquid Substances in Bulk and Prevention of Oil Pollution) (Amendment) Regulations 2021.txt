5th July 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Pollution from Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/68) (“the 2018 Regulations”) and the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Oil Pollution) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/42) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
These Regulations amend the requirements in regulation 8 of the 2018 Regulations (relevant requirements) in relation to offshore support vessels carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk.
Such vessels built or adapted before 1st July 2018 must comply with the Offshore Support Vessel Guidelines (as adopted by International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolution A.673(16)). Such vessels built or adapted on or after 1st July 2018 must comply with the Code for the Transport and Handling of Hazardous and Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk on Offshore Support Vessels (as adopted by IMO Resolution A.1122(30) (“the OSV Chemical Code”) (regulation 2(4)). These requirements give effect to the obligation in regulation 11.2 of Annex II to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 (MARPOL) (prevention of pollution by noxious liquid substances in bulk) to establish appropriate measures based on the guidelines developed by the IMO in respect of ships other than chemical tankers and liquefied gas carriers certified to carry noxious liquid substances in bulk identified in chapter 17 of the International Bulk Chemical Code.
These Regulations also amend regulation 24 of the 2018 Regulations (which, subject to limited exceptions, prohibits the discharge of noxious liquid substances from ships into the sea) to the effect that this prohibition applies to offshore support vessels in all circumstances except where there are reasons of particular necessity for the discharge, such as to save life (regulation 2(5)).
These Regulations also give effect to IMO Resolution MEPC.314(74), which came into force on 1st October 2020. MEPC.314(74) amends regulation 15 in Annex II of MARPOL to allow for a cargo record book to be in an electronic format as an alterative to a paper version. This amendment is given effect in regulation 2(6), which amends regulation 29 of the 2018 Regulations. MEPC.314(74) also amends regulations 17 and 36 in Annex I of MARPOL (prevention of pollution by oil) to allow oil record books to be in an electronic format as an alternative to a paper version. This amendment is given effect in regulation 3(2), which amends regulation 20 of the 2019 Regulations.
The Regulations also update the ambulatory reference provision in regulation 4 of the 2018 Regulations (regulation 2(3)) in order to include a reference to the OSV Chemical Code.
The Regulations also make a number of incidental amendments to the 2018 Regulations (regulation 2(2) and (7)).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

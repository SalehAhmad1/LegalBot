Laid before Parliament

Coming into force

The Secretary of State makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 45C(1), (3)(c) and (4)(d), 45F(2) and 45P of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984(1).
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in England.
The Secretary of State considers that the restrictions and requirements imposed by the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (All Tiers) (England) Regulations 2020(2), as amended by these Regulations, are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with section 45R of that Act, the Secretary of State is of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.

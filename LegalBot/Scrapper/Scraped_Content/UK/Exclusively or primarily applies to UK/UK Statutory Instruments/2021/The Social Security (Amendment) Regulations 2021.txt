(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular where the Minister considers the retained EU law contains EU references which are no longer appropriate, under subparagraph (g) of section 8(2)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends section 148(1)(a) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (c. 4) (Entitlement of pensioners to Christmas bonus) to add Switzerland so that people in Switzerland who satisfy the qualifying conditions will receive the Christmas bonus following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. Regulation 2 also amends this section by replacing “member State” with “EEA state” since the Christmas bonus is paid pursuant to this section to people satisfying the qualifying conditions in all European Economic Area states.

(i)
for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in points (a) or (c) of Article 301(1) of Chapter 3 of the Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook, CCPs shall calculate the value in accordance with the method set out in Section 3 of Chapter 3 of the Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook by using a margin period of risk of 10 business days;
(ii)
for exposures arising from contracts and transactions listed in point (b) of Article 301(1) of Chapter 3 of the Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook, CCPs shall calculate the value (EADi) in accordance with the following formula:
EADi = max {EBRMi – IMi – DFi; 0}
where:
EADi = the exposure value;
i = the index denoting the clearing member;
EBRMi = the exposure value before risk mitigation that is equal to the exposure value of the CCP to clearing member i arising from all the contracts and transactions with that clearing member, calculated without taking into account the collateral posted by that clearing member;
IMi = the initial margin posted with the CCP by clearing member i;
DFi = the pre-funded default fund contribution of clearing member i.
All values in this formula shall relate to the valuation at the end of the day before the margin called on the final margin call of that day is exchanged;
(iii)
for situations referred to in the third sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 301(1) of Chapter 3 of the Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook, CCPs shall calculate the value of the transactions referred to in the first sentence of that subparagraph in accordance with the formula set out in point (a)(ii) of this Article, and shall determine EBRMi in accordance with Title V of Part Three of the Capital Requirements Regulation;
(b)
for institutions that fall under the scope of the Capital Requirements Regulation the netting sets are the same as those defined in point (4) of Article 272 of that Regulation;
(c)
a CCP that has exposures to one or more CCPs shall treat those exposures as if they were exposures to clearing members and include any margin or pre-funded contributions received from those CCPs in the calculation of KCCP ;
(d)
a CCP that has in place a binding contractual arrangement with its clearing members that allows that CCP to use all or part of the initial margin received from its clearing members as if they were pre-funded contributions shall consider that initial margin as pre-funded contributions for the purposes of the calculation in paragraph 1 and not as initial margin;
(e)
where collateral is held against an account containing more than one of the types of contracts and transactions referred to in Article 301(1) of Chapter 3 of the Counterparty Credit Risk (CRR) Part of the PRA Rulebook, CCPs shall allocate the initial margin provided by their clearing members or clients, as applicable, in proportion to the EADs of the respective types of contracts and transactions calculated in accordance with point (a) of this paragraph, without taking into account initial margin in the calculation;
(f)
CCPs that have more than one default fund shall carry out the calculation for each default fund separately;
(g)
where a clearing member provides client clearing services, and the transactions and collateral of the clearing member’s clients are held in sub-accounts which are separate from those of the clearing member’s proprietary business, CCPs shall carry out the calculation of EADi for each sub-account separately and shall calculate the clearing member’s total EADi as the sum of the EADs of the clients’ sub-accounts and the EAD of the clearing member’s proprietary business sub-account;
(h)
for the purposes of point (f), where DFi is not split between the clients’ sub-accounts and the clearing member’s proprietary business sub-accounts, CCPs shall allocate DFi per sub-account according to the respective fraction the initial margin of that sub-account has in relation to the total initial margin posted by the clearing member or for the account of the clearing member;
(i)
CCPs shall not carry out the calculation in accordance with Article 50a(2) where the default fund covers cash transactions only.
For the purposes of point (a)(ii) of this Article, the CCP shall use the method specified in Article 223 of the Capital Requirements Regulation with supervisory volatility adjustments set out in Article 224 of that Regulation to calculate the exposure value.”.

Two of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s TreasuryEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The primary purpose of this instrument is to make amendments to legislation that are consequential on changes made by sections 1 to 5 of, and Schedules 1 to 4 to, the Financial Services Act 2021 (c. 22) (the “Act”).
This instrument also revokes some provisions of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (known as the Capital Requirements Regulation or “CRR”) using section 3 of the Act. These provisions will be replaced by rules to be made by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”).
The rules made by the PRA to replace the provisions of the CRR revoked by this instrument can be found at https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation and a copy can be obtained from the Prudential Regulation Authority, 20 Moorgate, London EC2R 6DA. Section 5(3) of the Act makes provision for certain references in the CRR to revoked provisions of the CRR to be read as references to corresponding rules made by the PRA (referred to in the Act as “CRR rules”). Under section 5(4) of the Act, the PRA has prepared a document setting out whether and how the proposed CRR rules correspond to the provisions of the CRR revoked by this instrument. This document is published at https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation and a copy can be obtained from the Prudential Regulation Authority, 20 Moorgate, London EC2R 6DA.
HM Treasury are also exercising powers in the Bank of England Act 1998 (c. 11), the Banking Act 2009 (c. 1) and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (c. 8) (“FSMA”) in order to update related elements of the prudential regimes for credit institutions and investment firms.
Provisions contained in regulations 12, 17, 24, 26, 28 and 31 of this instrument are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively, and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (and in particular, the deficiencies under paragraphs (a) and (g) of section 8(2) of that Act).
Part 2 of this instrument makes amendments to primary legislation and Northern Ireland legislation.
Part 3 of this instrument makes amendments to secondary legislation. In particular, regulation 15 amends the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (PRA-regulated Activities) Order 2013 (S.I. 2013/556). That Order specifies, for the purposes of FSMA, which regulated activities are “PRA-regulated activities”.
Part 4 of this instrument makes amendments to retained EU law.
Part 5 of this instrument makes amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation Equivalence Directions 2020.
Part 6 of this instrument makes amendments to the Capital Requirements Regulation (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/1078).
Part 7 of this instrument exercises a power to remove certain investment firms from the definition of “investment firm” in the Banking Act 2009 (c. 1).
Part 8 of this instrument makes savings provision in respect of powers in Article 124(4) of the CRR to make, revoke and amend technical standards, and transitional provision in respect of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 laying down a general framework for securitisation and creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. A de minimis impact assessment is available from HM Treasury, 1 Horse Guards Road, London, SW1A 2HQ and is published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends two statutory instruments which prescribe fees that are payable in respect of certain applications. Article 2 of this Order amends the Civil Proceedings Fees Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/1053) to prescribe a £5 fee payable when bringing an appeal under regulation 38(9) of the Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and Mental Health Crisis Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1311) against a decision by a debt advice provider to refuse an application for non-disclosure of a debtor’s usual residential address. Article 3 of this Order amends the Gender Recognition (Application Fees) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/758) to reduce the fee for making an application for a gender recognition certificate to £5.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

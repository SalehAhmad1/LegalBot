(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) Regulations 2015 (“the Charges Regulations”).
The Charges Regulations include the charges that are payable for the supply of NHS drugs and appliances in England. Regulation 3 amends regulations 3 to 9 of the Charges Regulations to increase the single prescription charge applied for the supply of drugs, appliances and elastic hosiery from £9.15 to £9.35 (if the hosiery charge is for a pair, the charge is double that amount). This is an increase of around 2%. There are also increases to the charges for wigs and fabric supports of around 2%.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 16 to increase the cost of a 3 month pre-payment certificate from £29.65 to £30.25, and the cost of a 12 month pre-payment certificate from £105.90 to £108.10. This increases the monthly cost of paying for a pre-payment certificate by direct debit from £10.59 to £10.81. This is an increase of around 2%. Regulation 5 amends regulation 17 to reflect the increase in the costs of pre-payment certificates made in regulation 16 in respect of the refunding arrangements that apply in the circumstances specified in that regulation.
Regulation 6 makes transitional provision in relation to fabric supports and wigs supplied pursuant to NHS prescriptions written before 1st April 2021.

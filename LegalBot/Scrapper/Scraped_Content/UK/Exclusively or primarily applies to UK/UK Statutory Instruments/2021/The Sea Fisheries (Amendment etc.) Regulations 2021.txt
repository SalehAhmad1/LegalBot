(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make adjustments to the level of European seabass that may be caught as a by-catch within British fisheries limits, in particular in the English and Welsh zones.
These Regulations also revoke legislation relevant to Celtic Sea technical measures, which apply within the English and Welsh zones, to enable more responsive management and allow improved measures to be brought in through vessel licensing.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

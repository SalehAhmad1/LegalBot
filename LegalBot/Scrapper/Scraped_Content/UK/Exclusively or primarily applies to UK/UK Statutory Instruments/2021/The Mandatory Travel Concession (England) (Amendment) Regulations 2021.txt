(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Mandatory Travel Concession (England) Regulations 2011 (the “2011 Regulations”).
The 2011 Regulations make provision for the reimbursement arrangements between travel concession authorities and operators of public passenger transport services providing concessions under section 145A of the Transport Act 2000. These Regulations temporarily remove the requirement in the 2011 Regulations that it must be an objective of a travel concession authority when formulating reimbursement arrangements that the operator is no better off as a result of providing a concession. These Regulations reinstate that requirement from 6th April 2022.

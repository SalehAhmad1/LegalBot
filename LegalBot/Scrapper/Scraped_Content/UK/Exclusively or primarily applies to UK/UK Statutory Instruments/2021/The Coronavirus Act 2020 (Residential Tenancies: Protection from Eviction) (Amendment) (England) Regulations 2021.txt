(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations further amend Schedule 29 to the Coronavirus Act 2020.
Schedule 29 to the Coronavirus Act (“Schedule 29”) modified various statutory provisions with the effect that during the relevant period specified in that Schedule, landlords are required to provide at least three months’ notice of intention to seeking possession of housing let under a Rent Act 1977 protected or statutory tenancy, a secure tenancy, a flexible tenancy, an assured tenancy, an assured shorthold tenancy, an introductory tenancy or a demoted tenancy let by a local authority or housing action trust.
The provision made by Schedule 29 was to end on 30th September 2020. S.I 2020/914 amended Schedule 29 so that is has effect in relation to England until 31st March 2021. It also suspended the measures in Schedule 29 with the effect that the notice period reverted to the length prior to the coming into force of the Coronavirus Act 2020 where the landlord is seeking possession of the housing on grounds related to anti-social behaviour.
Regulation 2(1) extends the provision in Schedule 29 to 31st May 2021. The suspension of Schedule 29 by virtue of regulation 2 of S.I. 2020/914 continues in force.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument due to the temporary nature of the provisions.

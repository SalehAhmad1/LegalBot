1st October 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2019 and the Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2009 to replace references to Public Health England with references to the UK Health Security Agency.
These amendments are necessary because Public Health England, an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care, is being abolished. The UK Health Security Agency will take on the relevant functions of Public Health England.
In relation to the amendments to the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2019, provision is made to account for any future updates to the United Kingdom’s Emergency Reference Levels. Regard must be had to the version of the United Kingdom’s Emergency Reference Levels published by Public Health England if and until it is superseded by a version published by the UK Health Security Agency.

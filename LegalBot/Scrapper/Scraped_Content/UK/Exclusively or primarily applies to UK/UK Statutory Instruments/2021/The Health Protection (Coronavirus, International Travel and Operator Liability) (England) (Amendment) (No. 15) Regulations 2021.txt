(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/582) (“the International Travel Regulations”).
Regulations 3 and 4(1) and (2)(a) to (c) are concerned with domestic elite sportspersons who have returned to England after being in a category 3 country within the period of ten days before the day of their return, and are required to self-isolate in accordance with regulation 9 of the International Travel Regulations in consequence of paragraph 2(1)(lb) of Schedule 11.
Those Regulations specify the applicable regime and what is required in terms of testing and self-isolation under the International Travel Regulations in the event these sportspersons leave England again before the period for which they must self-isolate has expired.
Regulations 4(2)(d) and 5 correct errors made in earlier instruments.
Regulation 6 removes the requirement in Schedule 6 for passengers to list their seat numbers on Passenger Locator Forms.

At 5.18 p.m. on 6th December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/582) (“the International Travel Regulations”).
Regulations 4 to 6 together—
rename Part 1A of the International Travel Regulations,
in effect move regulation 4 (additional requirements on persons arriving in England who are not eligible travellers) of the International Travel Regulations out of Part 2 (additional requirements on persons arriving in England who are not eligible travellers) to Part 1A and renumber it as regulation 3ZA,
increase the age at which passengers are required to comply with the requirement to possess notification of a negative result from a qualifying test for the detection of coronavirus (“the pre-departure testing requirement”) from 11 to 12,
bring eligible travellers into scope of the pre-departure testing requirement, and
make provision consequent on these changes.
Regulation 7 amends regulation 11 (enforcement of requirement to self-isolate) of the International Travel Regulations in consequence of the amendments made to that instrument by the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) (Amendment) (No. 21) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/1339).
Regulation 8 corrects an error in the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) (Amendment) (No. 13) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/1107) so as to ensure that operators, in discharging the requirement under regulation 17A of the International Travel Regulations to ensure that passengers claiming to be “eligible travellers” have the “required evidence”, are able to accept evidence of having a clinical reason not to be vaccinated.
Regulation 9 amends paragraph 1 of Schedule 7 to the International Travel Regulations so as to require, where a person arriving in England requires valid notification of a negative result from a qualifying test for the detection of coronavirus, that the sample taken for the purposes of the test is taken no more than two (rather than three) days before the commercial transport service on which the person travels to England is due to, or (as the case may be) actually, departs.
Regulation 10 amends Schedule 12 to the International Travel Regulations to update the information which operators must provide to passengers arriving in England.
These Regulations make further minor amendments to the International Travel Regulations.

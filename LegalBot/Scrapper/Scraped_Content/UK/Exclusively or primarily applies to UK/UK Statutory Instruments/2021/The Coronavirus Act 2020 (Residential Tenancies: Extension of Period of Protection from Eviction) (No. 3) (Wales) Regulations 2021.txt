Schedule 29 modifies various statutory provisions, relating to notices that need to be given in order to seek possession of dwellings during “the relevant period” (as defined by paragraph 1(1) of that Schedule).
The Coronavirus Act 2020 (Assured Tenancies and Assured Shorthold Tenancies, Extension of Notice Periods) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/778 (W.172)) and, in part, the Coronavirus Act 2020 (Residential Tenancies: Protection from Eviction) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1044 (W.233)) amended the modifications made by Schedule 29.
The provision made by Schedule 29 was originally to end on 30 September 2020 (at the end of the relevant period). Regulation 3 of S.I. 2020/1044 (W.233) amended paragraph 1(1)(b)(ii) of the definition of the relevant period so that Schedule 29 had effect in relation to Wales until 31 March 2021.

Regulation 2 of these Regulations further amends paragraph 1(1)(b)(ii) so that Schedule 29 has effect (as amended by S.I. 2020/778 (W.172) and subsequently by S.I. 2020/1044 (W.233)), in relation to Wales, until 31 December 2021.

19th April 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes amendments to the secondary legislation relating to primary school assessments.
Articles 2 and 3 respectively amend all provisions of the Education (National Curriculum) (Key Stage 2 Assessment Arrangements) (England) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/1038) (“the 2003 Order”) and of the Education (National Curriculum) (Key Stage 1 Assessment Arrangements) (England) Order 2004 (S.I. 2004/2783) (“the 2004 Order), which place duties or obligations on head teachers, governing bodies and local authorities in relation to the Key Stages 1 and 2 assessments, checks and tests due to take place during the 2020-21 school year, with the exception of the provisions under 5A of the 2004 Order, which are disapplied for the summer term of the 2020-21 school year only.
This has the effect that the Key Stages 1 and 2 assessments, checks, tests and related obligations, which would otherwise have taken place in, or in relation to, the 2020-21 school year (and in the case of the phonics screening check, the summer term of the 2020-21 school year) are no longer legally required.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.
An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

These Regulations amend the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2960). They extend the range of holiday accommodation contracts governed by the 2010 Regulations, amend provision with respect to the languages that must be used in contracts and key information and make changes to the content of standard information forms.

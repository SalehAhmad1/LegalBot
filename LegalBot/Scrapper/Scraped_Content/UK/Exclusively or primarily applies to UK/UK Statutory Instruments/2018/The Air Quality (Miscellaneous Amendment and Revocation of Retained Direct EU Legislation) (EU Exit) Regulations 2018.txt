(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8 of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures in retained direct EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under paragraphs (a), (d) and (g) of section 8(2) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of air quality. Part 2 amends and revokes retained direct EU legislation and removes certain references made to that legislation in an annex to the EAA agreement.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

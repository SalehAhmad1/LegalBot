(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 5(5) of the Categories of Gaming Machine Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/2158) (“the 2007 Regulations”) defines a sub-category B2 gaming machine for the purposes of the Gambling Act 2005 (c. 19).
These Regulations amend regulation 5(5) of the 2007 Regulations to reduce the maximum charge for use for such a machine to £2, and amend the definition of sub-category B3 gaming machines in regulation 5(4) to ensure that sub-category B3 gaming machines can continue to be distinguished from sub-category B2 gaming machines. Both of these sub-categories of gaming machine may be made available for use in accordance with a casino premises licence or a betting premises licence, but of the two sub-categories, only sub-category B3 gaming machines may also be made available for use in accordance with an adult gaming centre premises licence or a bingo premises licence.
To remove requirements that no longer have effect in practice as a consequence of this reduction, these Regulations also amend the Gaming Machine (Circumstances of Use) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/2319) and revoke the Gaming Machine (Circumstances of Use) (Amendment) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/121).

(2) It is an offence to make a false or misleading statement in an application.
(3) Schedule 1 (procedures) has effect.Issue of authorisations for shipments of radioactive waste
11.—(1) A competent authority must not authorise a shipment of radioactive waste unless this regulation is complied with.
(2) An applicant must make a written assessment of all practicable options for management of the radioactive waste.
(3) In the case of low-level waste, the proposed shipment must be for—
(a)
the recovery of re-usable materials;
(b)
treatment to make its subsequent storage and disposal more manageable;
(c)
sending samples for investigative analysis; or
(d)
the return to the country of origin of radioactive waste resulting from the processing of radioactive waste or spent fuel in another country (or an equivalent amount of other radioactive waste by way of substitute).
(4) In the case of intermediate-level or high-level waste, the proposed shipment must be for—
(a)
the recovery of re-usable materials, where this is the genuine prime purpose;
(b)
treatment to make its subsequent storage and disposal more manageable, in cases—
(i)
where the processes are at a developmental stage; or
(ii)
which involve quantities that are too small for the process to be practicable in the country of origin;
(c)
sending samples for investigative analysis; or
(d)
the return to the country of origin of radioactive waste resulting from the processing of radioactive waste or spent fuel in another country (or an equivalent amount of other radioactive waste by way of substitute).
(5) If the processes at paragraphs (3) and (4) would add materially to the radioactive waste needing to be disposed of in the country of destination, the applicant must demonstrate that the waste will be returned to the country of origin, to a timescale agreed by the competent authorities in the countries of origin and destination.
(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (3), (4) and (5), radioactive waste may be imported for treatment and disposal in the United Kingdom—
(a)
if it is in the form of spent or disused sealed sources that were manufactured in the United Kingdom; or
(b)
if it arises from small users, such as hospitals, situated in—
(i)
countries that produce such small quantities of radioactive waste that the provision of their own specialised installations would be impractical, or
(ii)
countries that cannot reasonably be expected to acquire suitable disposal facilities.
(7) Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) to (6), radioactive waste arising from the reprocessing of spent fuel may be returned to its country of origin.
(8) In this regulation—
“low-level waste” means radioactive waste having a radioactive content not exceeding four gigabecquerels per tonne (GBq/te) of alpha activity or twelve GBq/te of beta or gamma activity;
“intermediate level waste” means radioactive waste with radioactivity levels exceeding the upper boundaries for low-level waste, but which does not require the heat generated from the waste to be taken into account in the design of storage or disposal facilities; and
“high level waste” means radioactive waste in which the temperature may rise significantly as a result of its radioactivity, so that this factor has to be taken into account in designing storage or disposal facilities.Appeals
12.—(1) An applicant whose application for an authorisation is refused, or granted subject to conditions, may appeal in writing within two months of the decision, giving full reasons, to—
(a)
in England, the Secretary of State;
(b)
in Scotland, the Scottish Ministers;
(c)
in Wales, the Welsh Ministers;
(d)
in Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.

(2) If the competent authority so decides it must immediately inform the competent authorities in all countries involved in the shipment.
(3) In the case of radioactive waste or spent fuel that has been brought into the United Kingdom, the person holding the authorisation granted under these Regulations must either return the consignment to the country of origin if instructed to do so by the competent authority, taking corrective safety measures if necessary, or otherwise dispose of it as instructed by the competent authority and failure to comply with an instruction of the competent authority is an offence.
(4) In the case of radioactive waste or spent fuel that is being or has been shipped from the United Kingdom—
(a)
unless alternative safe arrangements can be made, the competent authority must serve a notice on the person holding the authorisation requiring the authorised person to take the shipment back, and
(b)
the person holding the authorisation must comply with the notice, taking corrective safety measures if necessary, and failure to do so is an offence.
(5) The person holding the authorisation is liable for costs arising if a shipment is not completed.Notices
14.—(1) Schedule 2 makes provision in relation to notices served by an authorised officer of the competent authority and references in that Schedule to an “authorised officer” are references to such a person.
(2) Failure to comply with such a notice is an offence.Powers to give directions
15.  The Secretary of State in England, Welsh Ministers in Wales, Scottish Ministers in Scotland and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland may, in relation to any application for an authorisation, give to the competent authority directions as to whether the authorisation is to be granted, the conditions to which it must be subject, and the competent authority must comply with the direction if this is compatible with these Regulations.Penalties

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (“EUWA”) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(c) of the EUWA) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The Regulations extend to the whole of the United Kingdom.
These Regulations revoke the Transfrontier Shipment of Radioactive Waste and Spent Fuel Regulations 2008 (the “2008 Regulations”). The 2008 Regulations implemented Council Directive 96/29/Euratom laying down basic standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation and Council Directive 2006/117/Euratom (the “2006 Directive”) on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel. In particular, the 2008 Regulations laid down the process and procedures for authorising the import, export and transit of shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel into and out of the European Union. In that regard, they drew a distinction between Member States of the European Union and third countries and provided that an authorisation granted at the first point of entry into the European Union was valid throughout all Member States. They also laid down a prohibition on the granting of authorisations for the shipment of radioactive waste unless the purpose of the shipment was for the processing of the waste or its return to the country of origin.
These Regulations largely replicate the key provisions and penalties contained in the 2008 Regulations in the United Kingdom but, in light of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, they abolish the distinction between Member States and third countries. That means that all countries outside the United Kingdom will be treated as third countries and there is no longer any provision for the mutual recognition of authorisations. These Regulations also largely replicate the key procedural provisions contained in the 2006 Directive in order to provide the maximum continuity for operators in this sector. The standard forms referred to in regulation 9 will be prescribed by the Secretary of State outside of this instrument and hosted on the Gov.UK website as well as the websites of the competent authorities.
An impact assessment has not been provided for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.
An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared and is available alongside this instrument at www.legislation.gov.uk.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments which are consequential on Part 3 of the Building Safety Act 2022 (c. 30) (“the 2022 Act”).
Regulations 2 to 16 make consequential amendments to the London Building Acts (Amendment) Act 1939, the County of Merseyside Act 1980, the Cheshire County Council Act 1980, the West Yorkshire Act 1980, the Highways Act 1980, the Greater Manchester Act 1981, the County of Kent Act 1981, the Staffordshire Act 1983, the Surrey Act 1985, the Leicestershire Act 1985, the Poole Borough Council Act 1986, the Berkshire Act 1986, the Plymouth City Council Act 1987, the Essex Act 1987 and the Clean Air Act 1993.
These amendments relate to the repeal by paragraph 20 of Schedule 5 to the 2022 Act of section 16 of the Building Act 1984 (c. 55), which provided for the deposit of plans for proposed building work with local authorities. Section 33 of the 2022 provides for the making of applications for building control approval instead of depositing of plans. Paragraph 1B of Schedule 1 to the Building Act 1984, in particular, makes provision about applications for building control approval. For the most part these amendments replace a reference to deposit of plans with a reference to the making of an application for building control approval.
Regulation 17 makes transitional provisions to ensure the amendments in these Regulations do not affect building work for which a notice is given or plans are deposited under section 16 of the Building Act 1984 before 1st October 2023.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the definition of “relevant matter”, as it has effect in England and Wales, in section 113A of the Police Act 1997 (c. 50). A relevant matter is a matter which, if it is recorded in central records, must be disclosed by the Disclosure and Barring Service in response to an application for a criminal record certificate or an enhanced criminal record certificate. The amendments made by this Order ensure that a conviction or caution that is not spent within the meaning of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 (c. 53) will always be disclosed on such certificates.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector or community bodies is foreseen.

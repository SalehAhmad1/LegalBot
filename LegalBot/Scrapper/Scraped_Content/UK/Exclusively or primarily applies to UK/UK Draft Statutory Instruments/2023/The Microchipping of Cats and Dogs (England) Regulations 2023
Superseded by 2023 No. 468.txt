DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for the compulsory microchipping of cats and dogs and the recording of each cat’s or dog’s identity and its keeper’s contact details on a database.
The compulsory microchipping of dogs was introduced by the Microchipping of Dogs (England) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/108). Regulation 18 of these Regulations revokes those Regulations. These Regulations also make equivalent provision in respect of the microchipping of cats as well as dogs, making minor and technical drafting changes to clarify the policy intention. These Regulations come into force on the twenty first day after they are made except regulations 3, 4, 9, 13, 14(2)(a), (e) and (f) and 15(2), in relation to the compulsory microchipping of cats, which come into force on 10th June 2024.
Regulation 3 imposes a duty on every keeper of a cat or dog to have their cat or dog microchipped in accordance with these Regulations. Regulation 4 sets out an exception to the requirement to microchip.
Regulation 5 sets out the standards applying to microchips. Regulation 6 sets out the information to be recorded on a database. Regulation 7 sets out the conditions to be met by database operators.
Regulation 8 gives the Secretary of State power to require information from database operators. It also, in circumstances where database operators are failing to meet the requirements in regulation 7, gives the Secretary of State the power to serve a notice requiring database operators to cease holding themselves out as meeting the requirements of the Regulations. The notice may also require the operator to provide an electronic copy of the data recorded in accordance with these Regulations to the Secretary of State or to another database operator.
Regulation 9 requires a new keeper to update the information on the database and prevents a cat or dog from being transferred to a new keeper until it has been microchipped.
Regulation 10 sets training standards for people who implant microchips. Regulation 11 provides for reporting of adverse reactions to, and migration of, microchips and reporting of microchip failures.
Regulation 12 provides for the appointment of authorised persons to enforce the obligation to microchip. Regulation 13 gives an authorised person powers to serve a notice on a keeper to microchip their cat or dog, and in the event of failure to do so, to take possession of the animal for the purpose of microchipping it and recover the cost of doing so from the keeper.
Regulation 14 contains offences. Regulation 15 provides for appeals to the First-tier tribunal against notices served under these Regulations. Regulation 16 provides for offences committed by bodies corporate, partnerships and unincorporated associations.
Regulation 17 provides for a periodic review of these Regulations, the first such review to take place within five years of their coming into force.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

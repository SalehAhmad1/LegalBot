DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the definition of “house in multiple occupation” (“HMO”) in England for the purposes of Part 2 of the Housing Act 2004. The effect is that accommodation provided on behalf of the Home Office for asylum-seekers does not require an HMO licence from a local authority during a specified period.
The exemption from the requirement to obtain a licence applies where arrangements for accommodation to be provided for asylum-seekers begin during the period beginning with the coming into force of these Regulations and ending on 30th June 2024 and lasts for a period of 2 years from the date those arrangements begin.
An impact assessment has not been produced as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is envisaged.

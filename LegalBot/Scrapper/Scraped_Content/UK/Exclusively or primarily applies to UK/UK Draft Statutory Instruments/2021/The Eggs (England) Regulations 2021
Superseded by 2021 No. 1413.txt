(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the retained European regulation that establishes marketing standards for eggs. They have effect in England only.
They amend retained Commission Regulation (EC) No 589/2008 (EUR 2008/589) on marketing standards for eggs, by permitting marketing standards checks on Class A eggs to take place at locations such as packing centres and wholesalers’ premises, but before sale to the final consumer or to mass caterers, rather than requiring the checks to be carried out before customs clearance.

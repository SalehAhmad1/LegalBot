(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for the establishment of appeal panels to consider appeals under the Space Industry Act 2018 (c. 5), and under Regulations made under that Act, in accordance with Schedule 10 to that Act. Part 2 provides for the panel members list, the appointment of members of that list to appeal panels to hear an appeal, and defines appealable decisions. Part 3 makes provision for applications for permission to appeal and their determination, the fees payable in respect of appeals, and applications to intervene. Part 4 makes provision for the procedure to be followed at appeals including the powers of the appeal panel to issue directions on procedure and evidential matters and the circumstances in which an appeal may be struck out. Part 5 identifies those persons who are prescribed for the purposes of section 66 of the Act, and who can therefore certify certain documents or records for use in legal proceedings. It also provides for review of the operation of the Regulations for the purpose of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (c. 26).
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Department for Transport, Great Minster House, 33 Horseferry Road, London SW1P 4DR and is published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside the instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

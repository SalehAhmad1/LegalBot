(b)
the Offshore Petroleum Licensing (Offshore Safety Directive) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/385);
(c)
the Pollution Prevention and Control (Fees) (Miscellaneous Amendments and Other Provisions) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1431), which make provision for charging fees:
(i)
relating to certain activities under the Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/1056), the Offshore Installations (Offshore Safety Directive) (Safety Case etc.) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/398) and the Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/310);
(ii)

in connection with consents under section 82A of the Energy Act 2008 (c.32) and emergency safety notices under sections 82F and 82G(8) of that Act;

In each case these Regulations increase the hourly rate for specialist officers from £190 to £197 and for non-specialist officers from £101 to £108.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into operation, on 1st May 2021, codes of practice made under powers in the Extradition Act 2003 (“the Act”).
The first codes are the Police Powers Codes (entitled “Extradition Act 2003: Codes of Practice”) which are a revised version of existing codes made under section 173(1) of the Act in connection with the exercise by police officers and customs officers of the powers conferred by Part 4 of the Act. Part 4 of the Act sets out powers of search and seizure of premises and persons, application for warrants and production orders, entry to premises and the treatment of detained persons after arrest in extradition cases. These codes do not apply in Scotland.
The second code is the Transit Code (entitled “Code of Practice for Non-UK Extradition Transit”) which is issued for the first time pursuant to section 189D of the Act and is made in connection with the transit through the UK of persons being extradited from one foreign country to another foreign country. Sections 189A to 189C of the Act provide powers to detain and search such persons and powers to seize, retain or return items seized. This code applies throughout the UK.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

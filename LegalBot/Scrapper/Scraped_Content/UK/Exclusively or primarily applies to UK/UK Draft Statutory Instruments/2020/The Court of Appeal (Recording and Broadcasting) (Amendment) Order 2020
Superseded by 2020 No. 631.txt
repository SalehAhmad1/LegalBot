(This note is not part of the Order)
The Court of Appeal (Recording and Broadcasting) Order 2013 (“the 2013 Order”) makes provision allowing for proceedings in the Court of Appeal to be recorded and for recordings to be broadcast, with some exceptions, including an exception for proceedings on an appeal from a decision in family proceedings (or an application for permission to appeal from a decision in family proceedings). This Order amends the 2013 Order by removing the words which except an appeal from, or application for permission to appeal from, a decision in family proceedings, so that proceedings in the Court of Appeal on such an appeal or application may be recorded and broadcast in the same way as other proceedings covered by the 2013 Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

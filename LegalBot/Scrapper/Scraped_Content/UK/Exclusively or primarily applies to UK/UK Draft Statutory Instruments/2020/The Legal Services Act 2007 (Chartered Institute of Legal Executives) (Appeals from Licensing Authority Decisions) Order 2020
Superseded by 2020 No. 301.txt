(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes provision under section 80 of the Legal Services Act 2007 (c. 29) (“the 2007 Act”) for the First-tier Tribunal to hear and determine appeals from decisions made by the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (“CILEx”) in its capacity as a licensing authority. Licensing authorities regulate licensed bodies under the provisions of Part 5 of the 2007 Act (alternative business structures). The decisions are those which are appealable under Part 5 of the 2007 Act or under CILEx’s licensing rules. Section 83 of the 2007 Act defines licensing rules as rules about the licensing and regulation of licensed bodies.
Article 4 provides for such appeals to be heard and determined by the First-tier Tribunal and sets out the powers of the First-tier Tribunal in relation to an appeal under the licensing rules. The 2007 Act provides for the grounds of appeal and the First-tier Tribunal’s powers in relation to an appeal under Part 5 of the 2007 Act.
Certain provisions of the 2007 Act are modified by article 5 of, and the Schedule to, this Order in relation to appeals against decisions of CILEx. The modifications take account of the provision in Part 1 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (c. 15) for appeals from the First-tier Tribunal to go to the Upper Tribunal.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this Order as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

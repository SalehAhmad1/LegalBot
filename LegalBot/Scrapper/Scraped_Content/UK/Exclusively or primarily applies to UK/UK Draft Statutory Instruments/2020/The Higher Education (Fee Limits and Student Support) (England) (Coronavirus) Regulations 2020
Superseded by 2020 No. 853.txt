(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend legislation in relation to England which prescribes tuition fee limits and tuition fee loan amounts in connection with higher education courses.
Regulation 2 amends the Higher Education (Fee Limits and Fee Limit Condition) (England) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/903) to prescribe reduced tuition fee limits applicable to English higher education providers which are required to limit their tuition fees by virtue of section 10 of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 as a condition of registration with the regulator of higher education providers, the Office for Students. The reduced tuition fee limits apply only to full-time courses, only to undergraduate courses with limited exceptions, only to the fee limits applicable in an academic year commencing on or after 1st August 2021 and before 1st August 2022, and only where a higher education provider has recruited students in excess of a level notified to that provider in respect of an academic year commencing on or after 1st August 2020 and before 1st August 2021 (“AY 2020/21”).
Regulation 3 amends the Higher Education (Fee Limits for Accelerated Courses) (England) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/214) to make the same provision as in regulation 3 in relation to accelerated courses.

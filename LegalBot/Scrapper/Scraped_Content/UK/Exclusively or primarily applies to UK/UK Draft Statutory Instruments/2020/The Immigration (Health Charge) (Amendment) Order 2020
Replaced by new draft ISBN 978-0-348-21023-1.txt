DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Immigration (Health Charge) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/792) (“the Principal Order”), which requires a person who applies for entry clearance for a limited period, or for limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom, to pay an immigration health charge.
Article 2 amends Schedule 1 to the Principal Order which specifies the annual amount of the immigration health charge in respect of applications by different categories of person. In respect of applications by students, dependants of students and Youth Mobility Scheme Temporary Migrants, the annual amount is increased from £300 to £470. In respect of all other applications for entry clearance or leave to remain (for which the fee was previously £400), article 2(2)(d) draws a distinction between applications made in respect of persons over the age of 18 years at the date of the application, and applications made in respect of those under that age. In respect of applications made in respect of persons aged 18 years or over at the date of the application, the annual amount is set at £624. In respect of applications made in respect of persons aged under 18 years at the date of the application (including both applications made by applicants themselves aged under 18 years and also applications made in respect of a dependant where the dependant is aged under 18 years at the date of the application), the annual amount is set at £470.
Article 3 makes transitional provision so that the amendments made to the Principal Order by this Order do not apply to an application for entry clearance or leave to remain made before the Order comes into force.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes changes to electoral arrangements for Wiltshire following recommendations made by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. The area of Wiltshire remains unchanged.
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral divisions of Wiltshire and replaces them with 98 new ones for the purpose of elections held on or after the ordinary day of election of councillors in England in 2021. It establishes the names and areas of the new electoral divisions and the number of councillors for each.
Article 4 makes changes to parish wards which are consequential on the changes made by article 3. The changes to parish wards introduced by article 4 come into force for the purpose of parish elections in 2021.
The area covered by each division created by this Order is identified on a map which is available for inspection at reasonable times at the offices of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, 1st Floor, Windsor House, 50 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0TL.

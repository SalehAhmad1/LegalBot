(3) In paragraph (2), the relevant amount for an auction is the auction clearing price (that is to say, the price per allowance that, in accordance with the auction rules, each successful bidder must pay, irrespective of the original bid) multiplied by the number of allowances sold at the auction.
(4) The carbon price for the 2022 scheme year or any subsequent scheme year (the “relevant scheme year”) is the average end of day settlement price, calculated over the relevant period, of the December futures contract for the relevant scheme year, as traded on the relevant carbon market exchange.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4), the “average” end of day settlement price is calculated by dividing the sum of the end of day settlement price for each day in the relevant period for which an end of day settlement price is published by the number of days in the relevant period for which an end of day settlement price is published.
(6) In paragraphs (4) and (5)—
“end of day settlement price”, in relation to a futures contract, means the end of day settlement price per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent published by the carbon market exchange on which the futures contract is traded;
“futures contract” means a futures contract for allowances;
“relevant carbon market exchange”, in relation to a relevant scheme year, means the largest carbon market exchange as determined by volume of sales in the relevant period of the December futures contract for the relevant scheme year traded on the exchange;

(a)
in relation to the carbon price for the 2022 scheme year, the period beginning on 1st January 2021 and ending on 11th November 2021;
(b)
in relation to the carbon price for the 2023 scheme year and any subsequent scheme year, the 12-month period ending on 11th November in the year preceding the relevant scheme year.
(7) The UK ETS authority must publish the carbon price for the 2021 scheme year on or before 30th November 2021.
(8) The UK ETS authority must publish the carbon price for subsequent scheme years on or before 30th November in the year preceding the scheme year.Penalty notices

(d)
the person to whom payment must be made (which must be either the regulator or the appropriate national authority);
(e)
how payment may be made;
(f)
information about rights of appeal.
(5) Where the civil penalty to which the person is liable consists of both a non-escalating penalty and a daily penalty and the regulator considers that the regulator may wish to impose a daily penalty, the regulator must, before giving a penalty notice to the person, first give a notice (an “initial notice”) to the person.
(6) The initial notice must set out—
(a)
the grounds for liability;
(b)
the maximum amount of the non-escalating penalty that may be imposed;
(c)

(2) But paragraph (1) does not apply if, following an appeal, the person is found not to be liable to a civil penalty.Installations: carrying out regulated activity without permit contrary to article 26
50.—(1) Where a regulated activity that is not authorised by a permit is carried out at an installation in a scheme year, contrary to article 26, the operator of the installation is (after the end of the scheme year) liable to a civil penalty.
(2) Subject to paragraph (3), the civil penalty is CA + (RE x CP), where—
CA is an estimate of the costs avoided by the operator in the scheme year as a result of carrying out the regulated activity without the authorisation of a permit;
RE is an estimate of the installation’s reportable emissions in the part of the scheme year during which a regulated activity that was not authorised by a permit was carried out;
CP is the carbon price for the scheme year.
(3) When setting the amount of the civil penalty to be imposed, the regulator may increase the amount calculated under paragraph (2) by a factor designed to ensure that the amount of the civil penalty exceeds the value of any economic benefit that the operator has obtained as a result of failing to comply with article 26.
(4) The regulator must—

Transfer of permits: contents of application
8.  An application for the transfer or partial transfer of a permit must contain—
(a)
a description of the installation (or part of an installation) in respect of which the application is made (the “transferred units”) and of the regulated activities authorised to be carried out there (the “transferred activities”);
(b)
in relation to both the transferring operator and the new operator, an address to which correspondence relating to the application should be sent (in addition to the addresses required by paragraph 1(5) of Schedule 3);
(c)
if the new operator is a body corporate, the matters referred to in paragraph 2(1)(b) in relation to the new operator;
(d)
either—
(i)
the new operator’s monitoring plan in accordance with Article 12 of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018, together with—
(aa)
the supporting documents referred to in Article 12(1) of that Regulation;
(bb)
except where the transferred units are an installation with low emissions within the meaning of Article 47(2) of that Regulation, the uncertainty assessment carried out under Article 28(1)(a) of that Regulation; or
(ii)
the new operator’s specification of the parts of the existing monitoring plan that it is proposed be varied and any necessary corresponding update of the supporting documents and any uncertainty assessment;
(e)
in the case of an application for a partial transfer of a permit, the transferring operator’s specification of the parts of the existing monitoring plan that it is proposed be varied and any necessary corresponding update of the supporting documents and any uncertainty assessment.
Transfer of permits: grant of application
9.—(1) An application for the transfer or partial transfer of a permit may be granted only if the regulator considers that from the transfer date, the new operator—
(a)
will be the operator of the installation; and
(b)
will be capable of monitoring and reporting the installation’s reportable emissions in accordance with the monitoring and reporting conditions of the permit (including as varied under this paragraph).
(2) Where an application for a transfer or a partial transfer is granted, the regulator must give notice of the transfer to—
(a)
the transferring operator; and
(b)
the new operator.
(3) Where an application for the partial transfer of a permit is granted—
(a)
the regulator must issue a new greenhouse gas emissions permit (the “new permit”) to the new operator that—
(i)
sets out that the new permit comes into force on the transfer date;
(ii)
sets out the transferred activities and the transferred units at which the transferred activities may be carried out;
(iii)
includes such other provisions as the regulator considers appropriate to take account of the transfer;
(b)
the regulator may make such corresponding variations under paragraph 6 to the permit (the “original permit”) held by the transferring operator as the regulator considers appropriate to take account of the transfer;
(c)
the new permit comes into force on the transfer date to authorise the transferred activities to be carried out at the transferred units from that date;
(d)
the variations to the original permit have effect from the transfer date (which must be set out in the original permit).
(4) Where an application for the transfer of a permit (other than for a partial transfer) is granted—
(a)
the regulator must vary the permit under paragraph 6 so that it includes—
(i)
the name and other particulars of the new operator;
(ii)
the transfer date;
(iii)
such variations to the monitoring plan as the regulator considers appropriate;
(b)
the new operator is the holder of the permit as varied from the transfer date.
(5) But if the new operator already holds a permit (the “existing permit”) for an installation that is on the same site as the transferred units, the regulator may, instead of varying the transferring operator’s permit under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
vary the existing permit under paragraph 6 so that it includes such variations as the regulator considers necessary to take account of the transferred units and transferred activities; and the variations have effect from the transfer date, which must be set out in the existing permit; and
(b)
by giving notice to the transferring operator, cancel the permit held by the transferring operator so that the permit ceases to authorise regulated activities to be carried out from the transfer date.
(6) In this paragraph, “transfer date” means the date agreed by the transferring operator, the new operator and the regulator as the date on which the transfer or partial transfer to the new operator is to take effect.
Transfer of permits: underreporting discovered after transfer
10.—(1) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
after the transfer of a greenhouse gas emissions permit under paragraph 9 takes effect, the regulator becomes aware, following a determination of reportable emissions under article 45, of an error in a report submitted for a scheme year by the transferring operator under the monitoring and reporting conditions of the permit; and
(b)
as a result of the error, the transferring operator failed to comply with the surrender condition of the permit in respect of the scheme year to which the error relates.
(2) The regulator must give notice to the transferring operator of the error as soon as reasonably practicable.
(3) The transferring operator must within 1 month of the notice effect a transfer to the new operator of allowances equal to the reportable emissions in respect of which, as a result of the error, the transferring operator failed to comply with the surrender condition of the permit.
(4) The new operator must surrender the allowances within 1 month after the transfer of the allowances.
(5) In sub-paragraph (1), the reference to the transfer of a greenhouse gas emissions permit under paragraph 9 includes a reference to an application for a transfer of a permit to which effect is given by a variation of the new operator’s existing permit under sub-paragraph (5) of that paragraph.
Surrender of permits
11.—(1) Where a permit authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation that has ceased operation, the operator must apply to the regulator to surrender the permit on or before—
(a)
the last day of the period of 1 month beginning with the day on which it ceased operation; or
(b)
such later date as may be agreed by the regulator.
(2) Where a permit authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation where a regulated activity is no longer being carried out but it is not technically impossible to resume operation, the operator of the installation may apply to the regulator to surrender the permit.
(3) Where the regulator grants an application to surrender a permit under sub-paragraph (1) or (2), the regulator must give a notice (a “surrender notice”) to the operator.
(4) The surrender notice must—
(a)
set out a date (the “end date”) on which the surrender of the permit takes effect;
(b)
require the operator to—
(i)
submit to the regulator on or before a date set out in the notice a report of the installation’s reportable emissions in the period beginning on 1st January in the scheme year (the “end year”) in which the end date falls and ending on the end date;
(ii)
ensure that the report is prepared and verified in accordance with the monitoring and reporting conditions of the permit;
(iii)
where the permit is a greenhouse gas emissions permit, on or before a date set out in the notice, surrender allowances equal to the installation’s reportable emissions in the period referred to in sub-paragraph (i).
(5) The operator must comply with the requirements of the surrender notice.
(6) Where a surrender notice is given—
(a)
the permit ceases to be in force on the end date (and therefore ceases to authorise a regulated activity to be carried out at the installation from that date); but
(b)
the conditions of the permit continue to have effect as if the permit were in force until the regulator certifies that the conditions of the permit and the requirements of the surrender notice have been complied with.
(7) The reference in sub-paragraph (6)(b) to the conditions of the permit that continue to have effect includes a reference to conditions relating to reportable emissions before the end year that the operator is required to comply with on or before a date that may fall after the end date (for example, in the case of a greenhouse gas emissions permit, the condition referred to in paragraph 4(2)(b) and the surrender condition or, in the case of a hospital or small emitter permit, the condition referred to in paragraph 11(2)(b) of Schedule 7).
Revocation of permits
12.—(1) Where the operator of an installation fails to apply to surrender the installation’s permit under paragraph 11(1) on or before the date referred to in that sub-paragraph, the regulator must revoke the permit as soon as reasonably practicable after that date.
(2) Where a permit authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation that is included in the ultra-small emitter list for 2026-2030, the regulator must revoke the permit so that it ceases to be in force at the end of 31st December 2025.
(3) The regulator may revoke a permit if—
(a)
the operator fails to comply with—
(i)
a requirement imposed on the operator by or under—
(aa)
this Order;
(bb)
the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018;
(cc)
the Verification Regulation 2018;
(ii)
a condition of the permit; or
(b)
the operator of an installation fails to pay the charge for maintaining the permit in force(11).
(4) A permit is revoked by giving a notice (a “revocation notice”) to the operator.
(5) The revocation notice must—
(a)
set out a date (the “end date”) on which the revocation of the permit takes effect;
(b)
require the operator to—
(i)
submit to the regulator on or before a date set out in the notice a report of the installation’s reportable emissions in the period beginning on 1st January in the scheme year (the “end year”) in which the end date falls and ending on the end date;
(ii)
ensure that the report is prepared and verified in accordance with the monitoring and reporting conditions of the permit;
(iii)
where the permit is a greenhouse gas emissions permit, on or before a date set out in the notice, surrender allowances equal to the installation’s reportable emissions in the period referred to in sub-paragraph (i).
(6) The operator must comply with the requirements of the revocation notice.
(7) Where a revocation notice is given—
(a)
the permit ceases to be in force on the end date (and therefore ceases to authorise a regulated activity to be carried out at the installation from that date); but
(b)
the conditions of the permit continue to have effect as if the permit were in force until the regulator certifies that the conditions of the permit and the requirements of the revocation notice have been complied with.
(8) The reference in sub-paragraph (7)(b) to the conditions of the permit that continue to have effect includes a reference to conditions relating to reportable emissions before the end year that the operator is required to comply with on or before a date that may fall after the end date (for example, in the case of a greenhouse gas emissions permit, the condition referred to in paragraph 4(2)(b) and the surrender condition or, in the case of a hospital or small emitter permit, the condition referred to in paragraph 11(2)(b) of Schedule 7).

Former ultra-small emitters: hospital or small emitter permits coming into force after beginning of scheme year
14.—(1) This paragraph applies where a hospital or small emitter permit for an installation referred to in paragraph 4(2) or (3) comes into force on a day after 1st January in the relevant scheme year.
(2) References in paragraph 11(2) to a scheme year for which the installation is a hospital or small emitter must be treated as not including a reference to the part of the relevant scheme year before the date on which the permit comes into force.
(3) The installation’s emissions target for the relevant scheme year is the emissions target calculated under paragraph 16 or, as the case may be, 17 multiplied by the factor set out in sub-paragraph (4).
(4) The factor is (Y – D)/Y, where—
Y is the number of days in the relevant scheme year;
D is the number of days in the relevant scheme year before the date on which the permit comes into force.
(5) Paragraph 19 has effect as if the reference to the installation’s reportable emissions in the relevant scheme year were a reference to the installation’s reportable emissions in the relevant scheme year on and after the date on which the permit comes into force.
(6) In this paragraph, “relevant scheme year” has the meaning given in paragraph 4(1)(b).
PART 4
Emissions targets
Emissions targets other than for hospital-qualifying installations may not exceed maximum amount
15.—(1) Except in the case of a hospital-qualifying installation, an emissions target for a scheme year may not exceed the maximum amount.
(2) This paragraph overrides paragraphs 16 and 17.

Emissions targets: calculation of later targets where initial targets based on estimates
18.—(1) This paragraph applies where an installation’s emission targets for the scheme years in an allocation period are required to be calculated under—
(a)
paragraph 16(4) or (5);
(b)
paragraph 17(4) or (5).
(2) Paragraph 11(1)(f)(i) and (ii) do not require the installation’s hospital or small emitter permit to contain emissions targets for scheme years (the “relevant scheme years”) for which, at the date of issue of the permit, the information required to calculate the emission targets is not available.
(3) As soon as reasonably practicable after the information to calculate the installation’s emissions targets for the relevant scheme years becomes available, the regulator must vary the installation’s hospital or small emitter permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 by adding the emissions targets.
(4) But sub-paragraph (3) does not apply if the regulator has given a conversion notice to the operator of the installation, the effect of which is that the installation will not be a hospital or small emitter for the relevant scheme years.
Emissions targets: hospital or small emitters must not exceed targets
19.—(1) The operator of an installation must ensure that the installation’s reportable emissions in a scheme year for which the installation is a hospital or small emitter do not exceed the emissions target for that year.
(2) This paragraph is subject to paragraph 14.
Emissions targets: banking overachieved target
20.—(1) In this paragraph, an installation’s “bankable amount”, in relation to a scheme year, means ET – RE, where—
ET is the installation’s emissions target for that year;
RE is the reportable emissions stated in the installation’s emissions report for that year.
(2) But if the installation’s emissions target for a scheme year is calculated in accordance with any of the following provisions (emissions targets based on estimates), for the purposes of this paragraph the installation’s bankable amount for that scheme year must be treated as zero—
(a)
paragraph 16(4)(a);
(b)
paragraph 16(5)(a) or (b);
(c)
paragraph 17(4)(a);
(d)
paragraph 17(5)(a) or (b).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraphs (5) and (6), where an installation’s bankable amount for a scheme year (the “scheme year in question”) is greater than zero—
(a)
the regulator may increase the installation’s emissions target for the following scheme year (the “next scheme year”) by the bankable amount; and
(b)
if the regulator does so, the regulator must vary the installation’s hospital or small emitter permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 by substituting the increased emissions target for the existing target.
(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (6), where the amount of reportable emissions stated in the installation’s emissions report for the scheme year in question is amended following a determination of emissions under article 45, the regulator must—
(a)
calculate the bankable amount for the scheme year in question as if RE in sub-paragraph (1) were the amount of reportable emissions for that year as amended following the determination; and
(b)
where an increased emissions target for the next scheme year has been substituted under sub-paragraph (3)(b), further vary the permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 by substituting a revised emissions target for that year, based on the revised calculation of the bankable amount under paragraph (a).
(5) Sub-paragraph (3) does not apply if the scheme year in question is—
(a)
the 2025 scheme year;
(b)
the 2030 scheme year.
(6) Except where the installation is a hospital-qualifying installation, if increasing the emissions target for the next scheme year would result in an emissions target that exceeds the maximum amount, the emissions target must be increased by such amount as results in an emissions target of the maximum amount.
Emissions targets: targets for 2026-2030 allocation period for hospital or small emitters in 2021-2025 allocation period
21.—(1) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
a hospital or small emitter permit is in force for an installation that contains emissions targets for a scheme year in the 2021-2025 allocation period; and
(b)
the installation is included in the hospital and small emitter list for 2026-2030.
(2) The regulator must, on or before 31st December 2025—
(a)
calculate an emissions target for the installation for each scheme year in the 2026-2030 allocation period; and
(b)
vary the installation’s hospital or small emitter permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 to include those emissions targets.
(3) But sub-paragraph (2) does not apply if the regulator has given a conversion notice to the operator of the installation (the effect of which is that the installation will not be a hospital or small emitter for the scheme years in the 2026-2030 allocation period).
Emissions targets: errors
22.—(1) This paragraph applies where the amount of an installation’s reportable emissions used to calculate the installation’s emission targets (including revised emissions targets under paragraph 20) for scheme years in an allocation period is amended following a determination of emissions under article 45.
(2) The regulator may calculate revised emissions targets for the current and future scheme years in the allocation period and, if the regulator does so, the regulator must vary the installation’s hospital or small emitter permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 to include those emissions targets.
(3) In calculating revised emissions targets under sub-paragraph (2), the regulator may take account of what revised emissions targets for past scheme years in the allocation period calculated under this paragraph might have been if the determination had been made earlier (but may not calculate revised emissions targets for past years).
(4) In this paragraph—
(a)
a reference to reportable emissions used to calculate emissions targets for the 2021-2025 allocation period includes a reference to reportable emissions within the meaning of GGETSR 2012; and
(b)
a reference to a determination of emissions under article 45 includes, in the case of reportable emissions referred to in paragraph (a), a reference to a determination of emissions under regulation 44(3) of GGETSR 2012 or Article 70(1) of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2012.
PART 5
End of hospital or small emitter status
End of hospital or small emitter status: ceasing to meet criteria
23.—(1) Where—
(a)
an installation (other than a hospital-qualifying installation) is a hospital or small emitter for any of the 2021, 2022, 2023, 2026, 2027 and 2028 scheme years; and
(b)
the regulator considers that the installation’s reportable emissions in any of those years exceed the maximum amount,
the regulator must, as soon as reasonably practicable, give a notice (a “conversion notice”) to the operator of the installation.
(2) Where the regulator considers that a hospital-qualifying installation ceases to be an installation that primarily provides services to a hospital in a scheme year (the “relevant scheme year”) for which the installation is a hospital or small emitter, the regulator must, as soon as reasonably practicable, give a notice (a “conversion notice”) to the operator of the installation.
(3) But sub-paragraph (2) does not apply—
(a)
where the relevant scheme year is in the 2021-2025 allocation period and the installation was in operation in any of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 scheme years (within the meaning of GGETSR 2012), if—
(i)
the installation’s reportable emissions in each of those years did not exceed the maximum amount; and
(ii)
where the activity referred to in column 1 of the first entry in table C in Schedule 2 (combustion of fuels) was carried out at the installation, the installation’s rated thermal input was below 35 megawatts in each of those years.
(b)
where the relevant scheme year is in the 2026-2030 allocation period and the installation was in operation in any of the 2021, 2022 and 2023 scheme years, if—
(i)
the installation’s reportable emissions in each of those years do not exceed the maximum amount; and
(ii)
where the activity referred to in column 1 of the first entry in table C in Schedule 2 (combustion of fuels) is carried out at the installation, the installation’s rated thermal input is below 35 megawatts in each of those years.
(4) Where a hospital or small emitter permit may be revoked under paragraph 12 of Schedule 6, the regulator may instead of revoking the permit give a notice (a “conversion notice”) to the operator of the installation.
Conversion notices
24.—(1) A conversion notice must—
(a)
set out the grounds for the notice;
(b)
state that the installation is not a hospital or small emitter for the scheme year following the year in which the notice is given;
(c)
state that the operator must comply with the conditions of a greenhouse gas emissions permit from 1st January (the “date of conversion”) in the scheme year following the year in which the notice is given;
(d)
state that the operator must apply to vary the monitoring plan to comply with the requirements of a greenhouse gas emissions permit.
(2) Where a conversion notice is given, the regulator must convert, with effect from the date of conversion, the installation’s hospital or small emitter permit (if any) into a greenhouse gas emissions permit by varying it under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 so that the provisions of the permit are replaced by provisions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph 4 of Schedule 6.
(3) But if the regulator considers that the operator will not be capable of monitoring and reporting the installation’s reportable emissions in accordance with the monitoring and reporting conditions of a greenhouse gas emissions permit, the regulator must revoke the permit under paragraph 12 of Schedule 6 instead of converting it.
(4) When varying a permit, the regulator may make only such variations as the regulator considers necessary in consequence of the installation ceasing to be a hospital or small emitter.
(5) The conversion of the permit does not affect the obligations of the operator under the permit in respect of specified emissions before the date of conversion.
End of hospital or small emitter status: ceasing to meet criteria: publication
25.—(1) The regulator must, as soon as reasonably practicable, inform the UK ETS authority about each installation in respect of which a conversion notice is given.
(2) The UK ETS authority must, from time to time, publish the information referred to in sub-paragraph (1).
End of hospital or small emitter status: end of allocation period
26.—(1) The regulator must, on or before 31st May 2025 give notice to the operator of an installation to which sub-paragraph (2) applies—
(a)
stating that the operator must comply with the conditions of a greenhouse gas emissions permit from 1st January 2026; and
(b)
requesting the operator to submit any proposed changes to the monitoring plan approved in relation to the installation under Articles 11 to 13 of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2012 or Articles 11 to 13 of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018 to the regulator on or before 30th September 2025.
(2) This sub-paragraph applies to an installation that is a hospital or small emitter for the 2025 scheme year other than an installation that is included in—
(a)
the hospital and small emitter list for 2026-2030; or
(b)
the ultra-small emitter list for 2026-2030.
(3) Where a notice under sub-paragraph (1) is given, the regulator must convert, with effect from 1st January 2026, the installation’s hospital or small emitter permit (if any) into a greenhouse gas emissions permit by varying it under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 so that the provisions of the permit are replaced by provisions that satisfy the requirements of paragraph 4 of Schedule 6.
(4) But if, after the date referred to in paragraph (1)(b), the regulator considers that the operator will not be capable of monitoring and reporting the installation’s reportable emissions in accordance with the monitoring and reporting conditions of a greenhouse gas emissions permit, the regulator must revoke the permit under paragraph 12 of Schedule 6 instead of converting it.
(5) When varying a permit, the regulator may make only such variations as the regulator considers necessary in consequence of the installation ceasing to be a hospital or small emitter.
(6) The conversion of the permit does not affect the obligations of the operator under the permit in respect of specified emissions before 1st January 2026.

(6) Where the appropriate monitoring plan is modified under Article 14 of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018, Article 16 of that Regulation applies in relation to the modifications, but is to be read as if—
(a)
paragraphs 1 and 2 were omitted;
(b)
in paragraph 3—
(i)
references to the monitoring plan were references to the appropriate monitoring plan;
(ii)
points (c) and (d) were omitted;
(iii)
in point (e) “in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article” were omitted.
(7) Where the appropriate monitoring plan is modified under Article 14 of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018, sub-paragraph (1) of this paragraph has effect as if the reference to the appropriate monitoring plan included a reference to the plan as modified.
Reportable emissions must not exceed maximum amount
6.  If an installation’s reportable emissions in a scheme year for which the installation is an ultra-small emitter exceed the maximum amount, the operator of the installation must give notice to the regulator on or before 31st March in the following year.
End of ultra-small emitter status: ceasing to meet criteria
7.—(1) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
an installation is an ultra-small emitter for any of the 2021, 2022, 2023, 2026, 2027 and 2028 scheme years; and
(b)
the regulator considers that the installation’s reportable emissions in any of those years (the “excess year”) exceed the maximum amount.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (7), the regulator must, as soon as reasonably practicable, give a notice to the operator of the installation.
(3) The notice must—
(a)
set out the grounds for the notice;
(b)
state that the installation is not an ultra-small emitter—
(i)
where the notice is given in the scheme year following the excess year, for the scheme year following the scheme year in which the notice is given;
(ii)
where the notice is given after the scheme year following the excess year, for the scheme year in which the notice is given;
(c)
state that the operator must—
(i)
apply for a greenhouse gas emissions permit; and
(ii)
comply with the conditions of the permit—
(aa)
where paragraph (b)(i) applies, from 1st January in the scheme year following the year in which the notice is given; or
(bb)
where paragraph (b)(ii) applies, from no later than the date (the “relevant date”) set out in the notice.
(4) But the notice must also state that, where sub-paragraph (5) applies, the operator must apply for a hospital or small emitter permit and comply with the requirements of that permit, instead of a greenhouse gas emissions permit.
(5) This sub-paragraph applies where—
(a)
the operator within 14 days of the date of the notice—
(i)
gives notice to the regulator that the operator prefers to comply with the conditions of a hospital or small emitter permit instead of a greenhouse gas emissions permit; and
(ii)
submits evidence to the regulator that the installation is not an ineligible installation for the purposes of paragraph 4 of Schedule 7; and
(b)
the regulator gives notice to the operator that the regulator considers that the installation is not an ineligible installation.
(6) Where sub-paragraph (3)(b)(ii) applies, although the installation is not an ultra-small emitter for the scheme year in which the notice is given (see paragraph 2), the operator—
(a)
must comply with paragraph 5 in respect of the period beginning on 1st January in the scheme year in which the notice is given and ending on the earlier of—
(i)
the day before a permit for the installation comes into force; and
(ii)
the relevant date;
(b)
is not liable to a civil penalty under article 50 in respect of that period (but is liable to a civil penalty under article 60).
(7) Sub-paragraph (2) does not apply where—
(a)
it is not possible for the notice to be given in the same allocation period as the excess year; or
(b)
although it is possible for the notice to be given in the same allocation period as the excess year, the regulator considers that it would not be reasonable to expect the operator to apply for a permit before the end of the allocation period.
End of ultra-small emitter status: publication
8.—(1) The regulator must, as soon as reasonably practicable, inform the UK ETS authority about—
(a)
each installation in respect of which a notice under paragraph 7(2) is given; and
(b)
where relevant, whether the operator of the installation applied for a greenhouse gas emissions permit or a hospital or small emitter permit.
(2) The UK ETS authority must, from time to time, publish the information referred to in sub-paragraph (1).

SCHEDULE 11
Transitional provisions: installations
Permits under GGETSR 2012
1.—(1) This paragraph applies to a permit within the meaning of GGETSR 2012 that immediately before this Schedule comes into force authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation.
(2) But this paragraph does not apply to a permit—
(a)
in respect of which an application under regulation 13 of GGETSR 2012 for the surrender of the permit has been made but has yet to be determined;
(b)
that is due, in accordance with provision made under GGETSR 2012, to be surrendered or revoked; or
(c)
that authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation included in the ultra-small emitter list for 2021-2025.
(3) Where the installation is included in the hospital and small emitter list for 2021-2025, the regulator must—
(a)
convert the permit into a hospital or small emitter permit the provisions of which satisfy the requirements of paragraph 11 of Schedule 7 and that authorises the regulated activity to be carried out at the installation from 1st January 2021; and
(b)
give notice of the conversion to the operator of the installation.
(4) In any other case, the regulator must—
(a)
convert the permit into a greenhouse gas emissions permit the provisions of which satisfy the requirements of paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 and that authorises the regulated activity to be carried out at the installation from 1st January 2021; and

give notice of the conversion to the operator of the installation.
(5) When converting a permit under sub-paragraph (3) or (4), the regulator may make only such changes to the operator’s obligations under the permit as the regulator considers necessary to convert the permit into a greenhouse gas emissions permit or, as the case may be, a hospital or small emitter permit.
(6) But sub-paragraph (5) does not prevent the regulator correcting errors.
(7) When converting a permit under sub-paragraph (4), the regulator may include under paragraph 4(2)(d) of Schedule 6 a condition to give proper effect to Article 69(4) of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018 that requires the operator to submit a report to the regulator relating to non-conformities or recommendations for improvements stated in a verification report under the Verification Regulation 2018 in respect of the scheme year (within the meaning of GGETSR 2012) beginning on 1st January 2020.
(8) The conversion of a permit under sub-paragraph (3) or (4) does not affect the operator’s obligations under the permit in respect of specified emissions before 1st January 2021 (and GGETSR 2012 continue to apply in relation to such obligations).
(9) A permit that is converted under this paragraph continues in force as if issued under this Order until cancelled, surrendered or revoked under this Order.
Applications for permits, etc. under GGETSR 2012
2.—(1) An application under regulation 10 of GGETSR 2012 for a permit for an installation that is made to the regulator before 1st January 2021, but not determined before that date—
(a)

(b)
in any other case (except where the installation is included in the ultra-small emitter list for 2021-2025), must be treated as an application for a greenhouse gas emissions permit under paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 to this Order.
(2) An application under regulation 11 of GGETSR 2012 to vary a permit that is made to the regulator before 1st January 2021, but not determined before that date, must be treated as an application to vary the permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 to this Order.
(3) An application under regulation 12 of GGETSR 2012 for the transfer of a permit that is made to the regulator before 1st January 2021, but not determined before that date, must be treated as an application to transfer the permit under paragraph 7 of Schedule 6 to this Order.
Schedule does not apply to permits for relevant Northern Ireland electricity generators, etc.
3.—(1) This Schedule does not apply to—
(a)
relevant Northern Ireland permits; or
(b)
applications for, or in relation to, relevant Northern Ireland permits.
(2) In this paragraph, “relevant Northern Ireland permit” means a permit within the meaning of GGETSR 2012 that authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at a relevant Northern Ireland electricity generator.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order establishes a new emissions trading scheme covering greenhouse gas emissions from power and heat generation, energy intensive industries and aviation. The scheme will be called the UK Emissions Trading Scheme or UK ETS (see article 16). It is the successor, in the UK, to the EU Emissions Trading System (established by Directive 2003/87/EC).
Part 1 contains definitions that are used throughout the Order, including key concepts such as the “trading period” (1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 – see article 4) the activities covered by the scheme (“regulated activity”, defined in article 4 and Schedule 2, and “aviation activity”, defined in article 4 and Schedule 1), the different greenhouse gases covered by the scheme (see article 4 and Schedule 2 for installations and the definition of “aviation emissions” for aircraft), the participants in the scheme (“operators” of installations, defined in article 5, and “aircraft operators”, defined in articles 6 to 8) and who the scheme’s “regulator” is for different purposes (articles 9 to 13). Article 15 introduces Schedule 3 which contains provision about applications, notices, etc.
Part 2, after introducing the scheme and establishing a review requirement (articles 16 and 17), sets out other elements of the scheme relevant to both operators of installations and aircraft operators. The basic proposition of the scheme is that, for each year, participants have to surrender “allowances” equivalent to their greenhouse gas emissions within the scope of the scheme. So article 18 sets out what an allowance is and articles 19 to 22 set out rules limiting the number of allowances that can be issued. Article 23 permits allowances to be traded except where this is prohibited by other legislation. The rules on how allowances are to be issued do not, however, appear in this Order and will be the subject of separate legislation on free allocation of allowances and auctioning. Articles 24 and 25 introduce Schedules 4 and 5 which adapt existing EU legislation on monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, and how reports of emissions are verified, for the purposes of the UK ETS.
Parts 3 and 4 contain provisions specific (respectively) to operators of installations and aircraft operators. The scheme has slightly different rules for these different types of participants. For operators of installations there is a general rule that they need a permit (article 26(1)) and need to surrender allowances to account for emissions (article 27). From the general rule, there are different levels of derogation for hospitals and small emitters and for ultra-small emitters. Detailed provision in respect of each category of operator is set out in Schedules 6 to 8, although for operators subject to the general rule, and for hospitals and small emitters, many of the rules take the form of specified contents of permits. For aircraft operators, there is no need for a permit as such. However, aircraft operators must apply for emissions monitoring plans which fulfil some of the same functions (article 28). For aircraft operators, provisions about reporting emissions and surrendering allowances are in articles 33 and 34.
Part 5 contains provision allowing the regulators to charge for the performance of their regulatory functions under the Order.
Part 6 contains provision allowing the regulators to monitor compliance with the Order, including through inspections of premises and exercising powers of entry.
Part 7 contains provision about enforcement, including a range of civil penalties (articles 50 to 68) that may be imposed in respect of specified breaches of the Order or of permit conditions. General provision about civil penalties is in articles 47 and 48. In addition, article 44 makes provision about enforcement notices and article 45 about circumstances where a regulator can determine the greenhouse gas emissions of a participant in the UK ETS.
Part 8, which is supplemented by Schedules 9 and 10, contains provision about appeals from decisions made by the regulator about applications and appeals in respect of a number of notices (specified in article 70(2)) that may be given under the Order.
Part 9 brings together provisions without a natural home elsewhere in the Order, covering information notices (article 75), Crown application (article 76) and transitional provisions (article 77 with Schedule 11).
A regulatory impact assessment of the effect that the UK ETS will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Industrial Energy Directorate, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0ET and is available alongside the instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of environmental protection and, in particular, amend legislation on or relating to the regulation of persistent organic pollutants. Part 2 amends the Persistent Organic Pollutants Regulations 2007. Part 3 amends retained direct EU legislation. Part 4 amends other subordinate legislation.

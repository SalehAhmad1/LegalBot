They make provision under section 8C(1) (in particular under section 8C(1)(c) and 8C(3)) in order to make amendments relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The Regulations make provision under paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 to that Act for the charging of fees by public bodies in the United Kingdom in connection with functions conferred on them as a result of amendments made by these Regulations under section 8(1) of that Act; and they make provision under paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 revoking provision for the charging of fees for the exercise of functions which are removed by amendments made under section 8(1).
These Regulations also make consequential provision in exercise of the power conferred by section 41(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 to substitute a number of references to “exit day” with “IP completion day”.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of chemical regulation and the regulation of genetically modified organisms. None of the changes being made alter the technical requirements and standards established by the legislation.

Part 2 amends domestic subordinate legislation, namely the Chemicals (Health and Safety) and Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/720 – “the 2019 Regulations”), which in turn amends retained EU law in the field of chemical regulation and the regulation of genetically modified organisms. Regulations 4 to 6 amend the body of the 2019 Regulations. Regulations 7 to 9, together with Schedules 1, 2 and 3, amend Schedules 1, 2 and 3 to the 2019 Regulations respectively.

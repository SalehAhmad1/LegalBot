(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Local Authorities (Mayoral Elections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/1024) and the Combined Authorities (Mayoral Elections) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/67). The amendments made by these Regulations apply only in relation to mayoral elections taking place in England. Specifically they amend the requirements for candidate consent to nomination to cover the additional disqualification criteria imposed by the amendments made by the Local Government (Disqualification) Act 2022 (c. 17). These amendments add to the existing disqualification criteria the notification requirements set out in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (c. 42), a Sexual Risk Order made under section 122A of that Act and the equivalent notification requirements and Orders in effect in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.
The amended criteria are at section 81A of the Local Government Act 1972 (c. 70) for candidates for election to the office of elected mayor and paragraph 9A of Schedule 5B (mayors for combined authority areas: further provision about elections) to the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 (c. 20) for candidates for election to the office of mayor of a combined authority.

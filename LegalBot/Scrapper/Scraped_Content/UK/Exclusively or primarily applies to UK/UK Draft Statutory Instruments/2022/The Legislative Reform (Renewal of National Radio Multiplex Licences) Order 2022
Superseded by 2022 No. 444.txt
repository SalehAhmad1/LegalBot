DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under section 1 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c. 51).
National radio multiplex licences granted under Part 2 of the Broadcasting Act 1996 (c. 55) are renewable on one occasion in accordance with section 58 of that Act. Article 3 of this Order amends section 58: to allow for a renewal of a national radio multiplex licence for a period ending on 31st December 2035; to allow an application for a renewal to be made up to the ‘relevant date’ i.e. the date by which Ofcom would need to publish a notice under section 46 of that Act stating that they propose to grant a fresh licence to provide the service formerly provided under the licence (if it expired and was not renewed); and to allow Ofcom to determine the ‘relevant date’ less than one year before that date.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary sector or public sector is foreseen.

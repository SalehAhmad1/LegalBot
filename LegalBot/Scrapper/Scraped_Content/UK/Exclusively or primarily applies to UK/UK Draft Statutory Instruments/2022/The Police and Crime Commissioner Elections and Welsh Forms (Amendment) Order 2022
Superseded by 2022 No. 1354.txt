(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Police and Crime Commissioner Elections Order 2012 (S.I. 2012/1917) (“the 2012 Order”), in consequence of section 13 of the Elections Act 2022 (c. 37), which provides that the simple majority system is to be used in all elections for certain offices, including police and crime commissioners. This Order updates and replaces references in the 2012 Order to the supplementary vote system, which was previously used for elections for police and crime commissioners where there were three or more candidates.
Article 4 amends Schedule 2 to the 2012 Order which provides for postal and other absent voting.
Article 5 amends Schedule 3 to the 2012 Order, which sets out the rules for the conduct of police and crime commissioner elections.
Article 6 amends Schedule 4 to the 2012 Order which provides for the combination of a police and crime commissioner election with another election.
Article 7 amends the Police and Crime Commissioner Elections (Welsh Forms) Order 2012 (S.I. 2012/2768) which includes bilingual versions of ballot papers for elections in Wales, to provide for the simple majority system.
Article 8 similarly amends the Police and Crime Commissioner Elections (Welsh Forms) Order 2021 (S.I. 2021/291) which includes other forms for elections in Wales.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

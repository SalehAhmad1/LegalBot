The Industrial Training Levy (Construction Industry Training Board) Order 2022

Coming into force
***
The Secretary of State makes this Order in exercise of the powers conferred by section 11(2) and section 12(3) and (4) of the Industrial Training Act 1982(1) (“the Act”).
This Order is made to give effect to levy proposals submitted by the Construction Industry Training Board(2) pursuant to section 11(1) of the Act which, as required by section 11(3) of the Act, included proposals for the exemption of employers employing a small number of employees.
The levy proposals included proposals for securing that no exemption certificates(3) will be issued by the Board and the amount of levy payable by employers will exceed 0.2% of their relevant emoluments in respect of the base period for each levy period. Accordingly, this Order falls within section 11(4) and (5) of the Act.
In relation to the requirements set out in section 11(5) of the Act, the Secretary of State is satisfied that the levy proposals are necessary to encourage adequate training in the industry and the condition in section 11(6)(a) of the Act is met.
The Secretary of State estimates that the levy to be paid by at least some employers in the industry will exceed 1% of their relevant emoluments in respect of the base period for each levy period and accordingly this Order falls within section 11(7)(b) of the Act; the Secretary of State considers that the amount to be paid by employers in the industry is appropriate in the circumstances.
The Secretary of State has consulted the Scottish Ministers as required by section 88(2) of the Scotland Act 1998(4).
In accordance with section 12(6) of the Act, a draft of this Order has been laid before, and approved by resolution of, each House of Parliament.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order gives effect to levy proposals of the Construction Industry Training Board (“the Board”) which were submitted to the Secretary of State for Education under section 11 of the Industrial Training Act 1982 (c. 10) (“the Act”).
The levy proposals were for the imposition of a levy on employers engaged wholly or mainly in the construction industry for the purpose of raising money towards the Board’s expenses.
The Board must calculate the amount of levy due in respect of each construction establishment of an employer in accordance with article 7. This calculation is carried out with reference to the base periods in article 4. The total amount of levy payable by the employer is the aggregate amount of levy for all of the employer’s construction establishments. If in accordance with article 7 the aggregate amount of the relevant part of all contract payments, and emoluments (other than the relevant part of all contract payments), is £120,000 or more but less than £400,000 in any relevant levy period then a 50% reduction will apply for that period (article 8). If the aggregate amount is less than £120,000, then the employer will be exempt from paying the levy for the relevant levy period (article 9).
An employer assessed to the levy will receive a written assessment notice from the Board setting out the amount of levy payable by that employer (article 10). Payment of the levy must usually be made within one month of service of the assessment notice by the Board (article 14). An assessment notice may be withdrawn by the Board and the Board may also serve amended assessment notices (articles 11 and 12).
An employer assessed to levy may appeal against that assessment. An appeal must normally be made within one month of the date of service of the relevant assessment notice by the Board (article 15).
An impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business and the voluntary sector is available from the Department for Education, Sanctuary Buildings, 20 Smith Street, Westminster, London SW1P 3BT and is annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum which is available alongside the instrument on the www.legislation.gov.uk website.

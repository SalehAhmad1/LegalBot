These Regulations, at regulations 2 and 3, provide for the cessation of certain redundant EU rights and prohibitions in relation to the relevant matters set out in the Schedule. Regulation 4 amends Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on freedom of movement for workers within the Union for the same purpose.
No impact assessment has been prepared for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (the “UK ETS”) was established by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 (the “UK ETS Order”). The UK ETS runs for ten “scheme years” beginning in 2021. Operators of certain industrial installations and certain aircraft operators are required to monitor, report on, and surrender “allowances” equivalent to, their greenhouse gas emissions in each scheme year.
This Order amends the UK ETS Order to include flights from Great Britain to Switzerland within the definition of aviation activity, so bringing them within the scope of the UK ETS, to require the recalculation of entitlements to a free allocation of allowances to take account of the new category of historic aviation activity, and to permit applications for a free allocation of allowances on the basis of this historic aviation activity by persons who have not previously applied for a free allocation of allowances.
A regulatory impact assessment of the effect of the UK ETS on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Industrial Energy Directorate, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0ET and is available alongside the UK ETS Order on www.legislation.gov.uk.

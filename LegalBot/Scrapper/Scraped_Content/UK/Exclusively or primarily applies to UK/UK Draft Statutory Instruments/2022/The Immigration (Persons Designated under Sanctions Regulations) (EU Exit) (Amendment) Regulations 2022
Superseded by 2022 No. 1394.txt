(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 3 of the Immigration (Persons Designated under Sanctions Regulations) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1101) which provides for the effect of an immigration designation under section 48 of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) on a person lawfully in the United Kingdom. The amendments have the effect that if such a person leaves the United Kingdom either within the 20 working day period from the date of notification of the designation or, having made an immigration claim, prior to the notice of the appropriate Minister’s decision on it, then they are no longer treated as a person falling within section 8B(5A)(a) of the Immigration Act 1971 (in respect of whom refusal or cancellation of leave to enter or remain etc. would be contrary to the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Human Rights Convention or the Refugee Convention).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

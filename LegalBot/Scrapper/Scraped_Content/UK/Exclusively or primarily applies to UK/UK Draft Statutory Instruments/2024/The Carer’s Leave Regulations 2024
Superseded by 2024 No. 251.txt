(5) In this regulation “working day” means the period in which an employee is normally expected or required to work on the day the leave is to be taken.Calculation of a weeks leave
6.—(1) In respect of regulation 5 a week of carer’s leave is a period of absence from work equal in duration to the period the employee is normally expected or required to work in a week at the time of making the request, calculated in accordance with paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) Where the period for which an employee is normally expected or required, under their contract of employment, to work in the course of a week does not vary, a week’s leave for the employee is a period of absence from work which is equal in duration to the period for which the employee is normally required to work during the course of a week in the relevant period.
(3) Where the period for which an employee is normally required, under their contract of employment, to work in the course of a week varies from week to week or over a longer period, or where they are normally required under their contract to work in some weeks but not in others, a week’s leave for the employee is a period of absence from work which is equal in duration to the period calculated by dividing the total of the periods for which the employee is normally required to work during the course of a week in the relevant period by 52.

9.—(1) An employee who takes carer’s leave is, during any period of that leave—
(a)
entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment which would have applied if the employee had not been absent, and

11.—(1) An employee is entitled under section 47C(2)(bc) of the 1996 Act(1) not to be subjected to any detriment by any act or any deliberate failure to act by an employer because—

(b)
the employer believed the employee was likely to take carer’s leave.
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(a), an employee makes use of the benefits of carer’s leave if, during the period of carer’s leave the employee benefits from any of the terms and conditions of employment preserved by regulation 9 during that period.
(3) Paragraph (1) does not apply when the detriment in question amounts to a dismissal within the meaning of Part 10 of the 1996 Act.
(1)

(a)
the reason or principal reason for the dismissal is that the employee was redundant,

(c)
it is shown that the reason or principal reason for which the employee was selected for dismissal was a reason of a kind specified in paragraph (3).

(1)
Section 99 was substituted by the Employment Relations Act 1999, Schedule 4, Part 3, paragraphs 5 and 16, and was amended by the 2023 Act, Schedule, Part 2, paragraph 8.Calculation of a week’s pay
13.  Where—
(a)
under Chapter 2 Part 14 of the 1996 Act, the amount of a week’s pay in respect of an employee falls to be calculated by reference to the average rate of remuneration, payable to the employee in respect of a period of 12 weeks ending on a particular date (referred to as the “calculation date”),
(b)
during a week or part of a week in that period, the employee was absent from work on carer’s leave, and
(c)
remuneration is payable to the employee in respect of that week under their contract of employment, but the amount payable is less than the amount that would be payable, if the employee was working,
that week must be disregarded for the purpose of the calculation and account must be taken of remuneration in earlier weeks so as to bring up to 12 the number of weeks of which account is taken.Contractual rights to carer’s leave
14.  Where an employee is entitled to carer’s leave (referred to in this regulation as “the statutory right”) and also to a right which corresponds to that right and which arises under the employee’s contract of employment or otherwise—
(a)
the employee may not exercise the statutory right and the corresponding right separately but may, in taking the leave for which the two rights provide, take advantage of whichever right is, in any particular respect, the more favourable, and
(b)
the provisions of the 1996 Act and of these Regulations relating to the statutory right apply, subject to any modifications necessary to give effect to any more favourable contractual terms, to the exercise of the composite right described in paragraph (a) as they apply to the exercise of the statutory right.Name
Title
Department for Business and TradeEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for employees with a caring responsibility for a dependant to take carer’s leave. The Regulations are made in exercise of the powers inserted into the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (the “1996 Act”) by the Carer’s Leave Act 2023 (c. 18).
Part 2 relates to entitlement to carer’s leave. The entitlement to carer’s leave is provided for in regulation 4 which sets out the conditions for entitlement which must be satisfied by the employee in order to take carer’s leave and which includes substantive requirements for the entitlements such as falling within the definitions of a dependant with a long term care need (set out at 80J(2)(a) and 80J(2)(b) of the 1996 Act, respectively). Regulation 7 sets out procedural requirements to be satisfied by the employee, such as appropriate notice to the employer before taking leave. The required notice period is twice as many days as the period of leave required, in advance of the earliest day of the leave and does not need to be in writing.
Regulation 5 sets out that the right is to one week of carer’s leave and provides that this is to be taken within a 12 month rolling period. Employees are also given the option to take the leave as half or full days, up to and including taking a block of a whole week of leave at once.
Regulation 6 sets out how to calculate a week’s leave for the purposes of regulation 5.
Regulation 8 sets out the process by which an employer can postpone a period of carer’s leave where this would unduly disrupt the operation of their business. Employers must give notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and following consultation with the employee, confirm a new date on which they can take the leave within a month of the original date(s) requested.
Part 3 contains provisions applicable to the taking of carer’s leave. Regulation 9 elaborates on section 80K of the 1996 Act by providing that an employee is entitled during his or her absence on leave to the benefit of all of his or her terms and conditions of employment apart from the right to remuneration (excluded by 80K(3)(b) of the Act); the employee is also subject to all of the obligations under those terms and conditions except in so far as they are inconsistent with the right to take carer’s leave (this exception is at section 80L(1)(b) of the 1996 Act). Regulation 10 provides employees with the right to return to the job in which they were employed before taking a period of carer’s leave. Regulations 11 and 12 provide that an employee entitled to carer’s leave is protected from detriment and dismissal attributable to the fact that they took or sought to take carers leave.
Part 4 contains provisions applicable where an employee has a contractual right to carer’s leave, in addition to the statutory right contained within these Regulations (regulation 14).

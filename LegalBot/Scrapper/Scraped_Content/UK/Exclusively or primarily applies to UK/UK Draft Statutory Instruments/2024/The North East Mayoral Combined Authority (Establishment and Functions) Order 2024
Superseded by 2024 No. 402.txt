Section 110 was amended by sections 12(1) and (5) and 14(1) and (7) of the 2016 Act, and amended by sections 65(5) to (8) of the 2023 Act. The effect of section 65(10) of the 2023 Act is that the amendments made by section 65(5) to (8) of the 2023 Act to section 110 of the 2009 Act do not apply to section 110 as it has effect in relation to the making of an order in response to a scheme under section 109 of the 2009 Act.
(6)
Section 113 was amended by sections 12(1) and (6), and 14(1) and (8) of the 2016 Act and further amended by section 66(5) to (9) of the 2023 Act. The effect of section 66(11) of the 2023 Act is that the amendments made by section 66(5) to (9) of the 2023 Act to section 113 of the 2009 Act do not apply to section 113 as it has effect in relation to the making of an order in response to a scheme under section 112 of the 2009 Act.Citation, commencement, and extent

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order abolishes the Durham, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland Combined Authority and the Newcastle Upon Tyne, North Tyneside and Northumberland Combined Authority, and revokes the legislation establishing those Authorities (S.I. 2014/1012 and S.I. 2018/1133 respectively). This Order establishes the North East Mayoral Combined Authority (“the Combined Authority”) in their place, further to powers under Part 6 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”). The Combined Authority is established on 7 May 2024.
Part 6 of the 2009 Act provides for the establishment of combined authorities for the areas of two or more local authorities in England. Combined authorities are bodies corporate which may be given power to exercise specified functions of a local authority under section 105 of the 2009 Act, and power to exercise specified functions of any other public authority under section 105A of the 2009 Act.
Part 2 of the Order establishes the Combined Authority and provides for there to be a mayor for the area of the Combined Authority. Schedule 1 to the Order makes provision about the constitution of the Combined Authority.
Part 3 of the Order provides for the transfer to the Combined Authority of certain of the assets and liabilities etc. of the Durham, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland Combined Authority and the Newcastle Upon Tyne, North Tyneside and Northumberland Combined Authority, whilst also making provision for the transfer of staff from those Authorities to the Combined Authority, and other matters relating to continuity.
Part 4 of the Order provides for the cancellation of the election for the Newcastle Upon Tyne, North Tyneside and Northumberland Combined Authority, and for the election of the first Mayor for the area of the Combined Authority to take place on 2nd May 2024. The new Mayor will take up office on 7th May 2024.
Part 5 of the Order concerns the transport functions of the Combined Authority, which are to be transferred to it from the Durham, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland Combined Authority and the Newcastle Upon Tyne, North Tyneside and Northumberland Combined Authority.
Part 6 of the Order confers on the Combined Authority functions in relation to education, skills and training.
Part 7 of the Order confers on the Combined Authority functions in relation to housing and regeneration which are to be exercised concurrently with the Homes and Communities Agency.
Part 8 of the Order confers on the Combined Authority functions corresponding to those of the Mayor of London in relation to the designation of a Mayoral development area.
Part 9 of the Order makes additional provision for the Mayor for the area of the Combined Authority and funding by, amongst other things, setting out the functions of the Combined Authority which are to be only exercisable by the Mayor, and making provision for the funding of the costs of the Combined Authority and the Mayor.
Part 10 of the Order makes further miscellaneous provision in relation to the establishment of the Combined Authority.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument will have no impact on the costs of the business and voluntary sectors. The impact on the public sector is that conferring functions on the Combined Authority should lead to operational efficiencies that could lead to reduced costs.

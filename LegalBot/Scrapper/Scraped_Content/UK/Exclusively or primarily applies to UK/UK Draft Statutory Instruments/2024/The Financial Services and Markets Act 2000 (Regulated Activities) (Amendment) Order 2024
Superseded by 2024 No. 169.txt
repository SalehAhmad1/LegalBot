DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order specifies an additional activity which is to be treated as a “regulated activity” for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (c. 8) (“the Act”) and specifies an additional investment for that purpose. The effect of this is that a person who carries on such an activity in the United Kingdom must either be authorised under the Act to carry out the activity or be exempt (see section 19 of the Act (the general prohibition)). Carrying on a regulated activity in breach of this requirement is a criminal offence (see section 23 of the Act (contravention of the general prohibition)) and may result in certain agreements being unenforceable (see sections 26 and 27 of the Act (agreements made by or through unauthorised persons)).
The new regulated activity is operating a pensions dashboard service which connects to the Money and Pensions Service dashboards digital architecture, as specified in article 2 of this Order. For the purposes of this new regulated activity, any pension in respect of which information is requested by an individual or provided to an individual using a pensions dashboard service is a specified investment.

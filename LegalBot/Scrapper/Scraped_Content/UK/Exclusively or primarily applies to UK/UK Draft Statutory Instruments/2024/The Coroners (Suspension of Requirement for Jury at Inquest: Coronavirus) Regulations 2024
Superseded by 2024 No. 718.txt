(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in respect of section 7 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”) (c. 25), which sets out the circumstances in which an inquest into a death must be held with a jury. Pursuant to section 7(2)(c) of the 2009 Act, a jury is required if the senior coroner holding the inquest has reason to suspect that the death was caused by a notifiable disease. Section 42 of the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (c. 35) inserted a temporary subsection, subsection (5), into section 7 of the 2009 Act, with the effect that COVID-19 is not a notifiable disease for the purposes of section 7(2)(c) of the 2009 Act. Subsection (5) expires two years after the commencement of section 42 of the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022, subject to regulations under section 42(6) of that Act.
These Regulations are made under section 42(6) of the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 and provide for section 7(5) of the 2009 Act to expire at the end of 27th June 2026 rather than at the end of 27th June 2024.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

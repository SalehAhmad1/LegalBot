These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of domestic legislation to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(c) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to domestic legislation in the fields of mutual recognition of professional qualifications, in particular farriers, and animal health. Part 2 amends the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975 (c. 35) and makes transitional provision; Part 3 amends the Animal Health Act 1981 (c. 22); Part 4 amends subordinate legislation.
An impact assessment has not be produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (f) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of pesticides, and in particular amend legislation relating to plant protection products. Part 2 amends Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and other supporting retained direct EU legislation. Part 3 transfers functions from Directive 2009/128/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides (OJ No L 309, 24.11.2009, p 71). Part 4 makes consequential amendments, contains transitional provisions and savings, and revokes retained direct EU legislation.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

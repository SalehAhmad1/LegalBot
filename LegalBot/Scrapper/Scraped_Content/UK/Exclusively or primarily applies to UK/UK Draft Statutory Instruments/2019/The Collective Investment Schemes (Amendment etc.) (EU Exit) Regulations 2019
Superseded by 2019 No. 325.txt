72.—(1) Paragraph (2) applies to a person who—
(a)
is on exit day the operator, trustee or depositary of a collective investment scheme that—
(i)
is a stand-alone scheme and is a recognised scheme by virtue of regulation 62, or
(ii)
is the umbrella scheme in relation to one or more sub-funds that are recognised schemes by virtue of that regulation, or
(b)
at any time after exit day becomes the operator, trustee or depositary of such a scheme.
(2) The person is to be treated on and after exit day or, as the case may be, from the time mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), as if the person has permission to carry on a regulated activity in the United Kingdom under Part 4A of the 2000 Act, so long as the scheme remains a recognised scheme by virtue of regulation 62.
(3) The permission is to be taken to relate to the following activities so far as they are regulated activities for the purposes of the 2000 Act—
(a)
any activity, appropriate to the capacity in which the person acts in relation to the scheme, of the kind described in paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 to the 2000 Act;
(b)
any activity in connection with, or for the purposes of, the scheme.
(4) References in an enactment to a person with permission under Part 4A of the 2000 Act (however expressed) are to be read, unless the contrary intention appears, as including a person treated by virtue of this regulation as having permission under that Part to carry on a regulated activity.
(5) Accordingly, a power of the FCA under the 2000 Act is exercisable in respect of such a person and the regulated activities the person is permitted to carry on by virtue of this regulation as it is exercisable in respect of a person with a Part 4A permission and the regulated activities the person is permitted to carry on by virtue of Part 4A of the 2000 Act.
(6) Such a power is exercisable, in particular, in relation to—
(a)
the variation or cancellation of permission to carry on a regulated activity, or
(b)
the imposition of requirements, prohibitions or restrictions on a person who has permission to carry on such an activity.
(7) Paragraphs (1) to (4) have effect subject to the powers of the FCA by virtue of paragraphs (5) and (6).
(8) In this regulation expressions that are defined for the purposes of Part 17 of the 2000 Act have the same meaning as in that Part.Saving for certain EEA firms with temporary Part 4A permission
73.—(1) The amendments of section 243 of the 2000 Act made by regulation 8(1) to (3) do not prevent an authorised unit trust scheme from having as its manager or trustee a qualifying EEA firm, and do not apply to an authorised unit trust scheme whose manager or trustee is a qualifying EEA firm.

(4) A body corporate is for the purposes of this regulation a “qualifying EEA firm” if and so long as the body is, by virtue of regulation 8 or 11 of the EEA Passport Rights (Amendment, etc., and Transitional Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018(1), treated as having a Part 4A permission relating to one or more regulated activities and either—
(a)

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE

Save for regulation 50(6), these Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (and in particular the deficiencies referred to in subsection (2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (f) and (g) of section 8).
Part 2 amends Part 17 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (c. 8).
Part 3 amends the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1613).
Part 4 amends secondary legislation relating to collective investment schemes and makes amendments to secondary legislation consequential upon the repeal of section 264 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. It also revokes the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Collective Investment Schemes Constituted in Other EEA States) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/2383), and amends the commencement provisions in the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.
Part 5 amends Commission Regulation (EU) 2010/583 implementing Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards key investor information and conditions to be met when providing key investor information or the prospectus in a durable medium other than paper or by means of a website and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/438 supplementing Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to obligations of depositaries.
Part 6 contains provision enabling an EEA UCITS that is before exit day a recognised scheme under section 264 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to obtain temporary recognition for the purposes of Part 17 of that Act during a transitional period. Part 7 provides for the operator, trustee or depositary of a collective investment scheme with temporary recognition to be treated as having permission under Part 4A of that Act to carry on certain regulated activities connected with the scheme. Part 8 provides that in certain circumstances the amendments made by these Regulations do not prevent an authorised unit trust scheme, authorised contractual scheme or authorised open-ended investment company from having as its manager, trustee or depositary an EEA firm that is treated as having a Part 4A permission by virtue of the EEA Passport Rights (Amendment, etc., and Transitional Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018.

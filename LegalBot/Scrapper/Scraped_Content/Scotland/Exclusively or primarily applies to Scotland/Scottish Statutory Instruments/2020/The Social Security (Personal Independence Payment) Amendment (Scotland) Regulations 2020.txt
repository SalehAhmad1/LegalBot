Made

Laid before the Scottish Parliament
30th October 2020
Coming into force
30th November 2020
The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 83(3) and 94(2) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012(1) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
(1)
2012 c.5. The function of making regulations under section 83(3) of the Act is exercisable by the Secretary of State by virtue of section 94(1) of the Act. The functions of the Secretary of State under sections 83 and 94 of the Act, as regards Scotland, transferred to the Scottish Ministers on 1 April 2020. This is both in terms of regulations 3 and 4 of S.I. 2017/444, which provides for functions conferred on the Secretary of State by a pre-commencement enactment that would be within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament by virtue of exception 1 in reservation F1 in schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c.46) (social security schemes) to transfer to the Scottish Ministers on that date; and section 32 of the Scotland Act 2016 (c.11) which provides the meaning of “pre-commencement enactment” in this context. Under section 172(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (c.5), the Secretary of State is required to refer to the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) proposals for regulations under ‘relevant enactments’, as defined in section 170(5) of that Act. This includes regulations under the Welfare Reform Act 2012. However, as a result of section 33(1) of the Scotland Act 2016, the function of the Secretary of State to consult the SSAC has not transferred to the Scottish Ministers. There is therefore no requirement for the Scottish Ministers to consult the SSAC before making these Regulations.Citation, commencement and extent

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 27 of the Social Security (Personal Independence Payment) Regulations 2013 (“the PIP Regulations”).
Under section 83(1) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (“the Act”) a person is not entitled to the daily living or mobility component of Personal Independence Payment for any period after they reach the relevant age (defined in section 83(2) of the Act as pensionable age or, if higher, 65) (“the age restriction”). Regulation 27(1) of the PIP Regulations provides that the age restriction does not apply where the person has reached the relevant age, is entitled to an award of either or both components pursuant to an exception in regulation 25 or 26 of the PIP Regulations, and that award falls to be revised or superseded. Regulation 27(2) of the PIP Regulations modifies regulation 27(1) such that entitlement to the mobility component is restricted, as set out in regulation 27(3), where the original award is superseded for a change of circumstance which occurred after the person reached the relevant age.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends regulation 27(2) of the PIP Regulations so that the regulation 27(3) restriction applies not only where the original award is superseded for a change of circumstances that occurred after the person reached the relevant age, but also where it is superseded as a result of receipt of medical evidence from a healthcare professional or other person approved by the Scottish Ministers where the application for supersession (or Scottish Ministers’ action initiating a supersession) began after the person reached the relevant age.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

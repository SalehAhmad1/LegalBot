2nd July 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Adjournal)
This Act of Adjournal amends Chapter 14 (procedure at trial in solemn proceedings) of the Criminal Procedure Rules 1996.
Paragraph 2(2)(a) amends rule 14.1A(1) (minimum number of jurors for balloting jury) to provide that it is competent for balloting of the jury to commence if there are at least 30 jurors available for balloting. This has the effect of permitting balloting to commence whether or not those jurors are physically present in the court building.
Paragraph 2(2)(b) amends rule 14.2 (balloting of jurors) to permit the creation of a reserve list of 5 substitute jurors to replace, if required, any of the first 15 jurors selected who are unable to serve. It also permits the court to increase the reserve list from 5 to a maximum of 10 substitute jurors.

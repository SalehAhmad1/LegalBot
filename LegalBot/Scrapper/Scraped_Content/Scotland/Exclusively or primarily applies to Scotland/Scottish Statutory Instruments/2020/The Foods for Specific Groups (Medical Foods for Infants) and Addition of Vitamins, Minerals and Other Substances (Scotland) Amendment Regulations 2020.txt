Coming into force
22nd February 2020
The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 6(4), 16(1)(a) and (e), 17(1) and (2), 26(1) and (3) and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990(1) and section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972(2) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Scottish Ministers that it is expedient for certain references in these Regulations to provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods(3), of Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food intended for infants and young children, food for special medical purposes, and total diet replacement for weight control and repealing Council Directive 92/52/EEC, Commission Directives 96/8/EC, 1999/21/EC, 2006/125/EC and 2006/141/EC, Directive 2009/39 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulations (EC) No 41/2009 and (EC) No 953/2009(4) and of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/128 supplementing Regulation (EU) 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the specific compositional and information requirements for food for special medical purposes(5) to be construed as references to those provisions as amended from time to time.
In accordance with section 48(4A) of the Food Safety Act 1990(6), the Scottish Ministers have had regard to relevant advice given by Food Standards Scotland.
There has been consultation as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(7).

The functions of the Secretary of State, in so far as within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act. In so far as not so transferred, and in so far as relating to food (including drink) including the primary production of food, those functions were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by S.I. 2005/849.

Section 2(2) was also amended by the 2006 Act, section 27(1)(a) and by the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c.7) (“the 2008 Act”), section 3(3) and schedule 1, Part 1. The functions conferred upon the Minister of the Crown under section 2(2), insofar as within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act. Paragraph 1A of schedule 2 was inserted by section 28 of the 2006 Act and was amended by the 2008 Act, schedule 1, Part 1. The 1972 Act is prospectively repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) from exit day (see section 20 of that Act).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in consequence of the entry into force of new requirements in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/128 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the specific compositional and information requirements for food for special medical purposes (“the Delegated Regulation”) on 22 February 2020.
Regulation 2 introduces schedule 1 of these Regulations, which amends the Foods for Specific Groups (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”) to include reference to provisions of the Delegated Regulation which relate to food for special medical purposes developed to satisfy the nutritional requirements of infants. The amendments made by these Regulations to schedule 1 of the 2016 Regulations have the effect that it becomes a criminal offence not to comply with the requirements of the Delegated Regulation when such food is placed on the market, except where transitional arrangements apply.
The relevant transitional arrangements are inserted into the 2016 Regulations by paragraph 1(3) of schedule 1. These ensure that stocks of food for special medical purposes which were labelled or placed on the market prior to the date of application of provisions of the Delegated Regulation can continue to be marketed until those stocks are exhausted.
Schedule 1 of these Regulations also amends references in schedule 1 of the 2016 Regulations to provisions of Regulation (EU) No 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food intended for infants and young children, food for special medical purposes, and total diet replacement for weight control. It will become a criminal offence to contravene article 15(1) of the EU Regulation (Union list), but will no longer be a criminal offence to breach article 4(1) (placing on the market) of that Regulation alone.
Regulation 3 amends the Vitamins, Minerals and Other Substances (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (“the 2007 Regulations”). Regulation 3(2) ensures that the definition of “the EC Regulation” includes a reference to, as it may be amended from time to time, Annex 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods. Regulation 3(3) amends the 2007 Regulations with the effect that it becomes an offence to add a substance listed in Part A of Annex III of the EC Regulation to foods, or to use such a substance in the manufacture of foods. It also becomes an offence to add a substance listed in Part B of Annex III of the EC Regulation to foods, or to use such a substance in the manufacture of foods, unless that substance is added or used in accordance with the conditions specified in that Part.
Regulation 4 introduces the revocations in schedule 2, which relate to the Foods for Special Medical Purposes (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (“the 2000 Regulations”) and provisions which amend them. The 2000 Regulations implement Commission Directive 1999/21/EC on dietary foods for special medical purposes in respect of food for special medical purposes developed to satisfy the nutritional requirements of infants. Directive 1999/21/EC applies until 21 February 2020 in respect of such foods and thereafter is repealed by article 10 of the Delegated Regulation.

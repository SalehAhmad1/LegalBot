(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/871). Those Regulations impose on producers the obligation to recover and recycle packaging waste in order to attain the recovery and recycling targets set out in Article 6(1) of the European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (OJ No L 365, 31.12.94, p.10).
These Regulations replace the EU recovery and recycling targets with recycling targets on producers. They also vary the material specific recycling targets on obligated producers for paper, aluminium, steel and wood as well as the specific re-melt target for glass. The recycling allocation for small producers for 2018 to 2020 is changed for 2021 and 2022.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument (in combination with similar instruments in England and Wales) will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and public sector across the UK is available from the Producer Responsibility Unit at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Level 2, Nobel House, 17 Smith Square, London SW1P 3JR.

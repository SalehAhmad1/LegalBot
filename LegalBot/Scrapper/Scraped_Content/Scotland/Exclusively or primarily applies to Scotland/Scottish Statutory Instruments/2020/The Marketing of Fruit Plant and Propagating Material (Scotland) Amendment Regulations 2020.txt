(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement Commission Implementing Directive 2019/1813 of 29 October 2019 amending Implementing Directive 2014/96/EU on the requirements for the labelling, sealing and packaging of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production, falling within the scope of Council Directive 2008/90/EC as regards the colour of the label for certified categories of propagating material and fruit plants and the content of the supplier’s document (OJ L 278, 30.10.2019, p.7).
They amend the Marketing of Fruit Plant and Propagating Material (Scotland) Regulations 2017 (“the principal Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends schedule 5 of the principal Regulations to make provision for a supplier’s document affixed in the form of a label to Conformitas Agraria Communitatis (“CAC”) material to be yellow, and reduces the information required to be included in a supplier’s document.
Regulation 2 also amends Part 5 of the principal Regulations to make transitional provisions that enable CAC material affixed with a supplier’s document in the form of a label that is in a colour other than yellow and was in use before 1 April 2020 to be marketed in Scotland until 30 June 2021.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Criminal Justice and Data Protection (Protocol No. 36) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”) and provide for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2018/1805 of 14 November 2018 on the mutual recognition of freezing orders and confiscation orders (“Regulation (EU) 2018/1805”).
From 19 December 2020 the legal framework for the mutual recognition of freezing orders and confiscation orders between member states will be governed by Regulation (EU) 2018/1805. The 2014 Regulations set out the current legislative framework in Scotland for the mutual recognition of overseas freezing orders and confiscation orders and these Regulations make amendments for the necessary changes to the framework for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2018/1805.

7th September 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004. They amend building standard 2.15 in paragraph 2.15 of schedule 5 of those Regulations and insert relevant definitions into regulation 2. Building standard 2.15 requires certain buildings to be designed and constructed in such a way that, in the event of an outbreak of fire within the building, fire growth will be inhibited by the operation of an automatic fire suppression system. The amendments extend building standard 2.15 to apply to buildings containing flats or maisonettes, social housing dwellings and shared multi-occupancy residential buildings.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Single Use Carrier Bag Charge (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (S.S.I. 2014/161).
Regulation 2 inserts a new paragraph 1A into the schedule to make provision for circumstances in which the requirement to charge for carrier bags does not apply. The provision will have effect until 0001 hours on 3 October 2020.
The circumstances in which are the requirement to charge does not apply are: where a carrier bag is used solely to contain goods purchased for delivery as part of a grocery delivery service; where a carrier bag is used solely to contain goods purchased for collection as part of a service that allows a person to collect groceries ordered in advance; and where a carrier bag is used solely to contain food and drinks purchased for delivery or collection as part of a takeaway food service.
The emergency nature of the instrument means it has not been possible to prepare a Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment. The needs of business and, in particular, the retail sector have, however, closely informed the preparation of these Regulations.

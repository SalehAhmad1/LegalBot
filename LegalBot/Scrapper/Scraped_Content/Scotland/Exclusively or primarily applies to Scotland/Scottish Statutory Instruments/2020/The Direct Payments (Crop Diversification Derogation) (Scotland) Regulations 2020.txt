Coming into force

The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 69(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 637/2008 and Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009(1) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
The Scottish Ministers are of the opinion that, in order to resolve problems caused by the extreme weather conditions experienced across Scotland in recent months, it is both necessary and justifiable in an emergency to derogate from the specified provisions of that Regulation, and that the derogation applies to the extent and for such period as are strictly necessary.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Farmers entitled to a payment under the basic payment scheme must observe certain agricultural practices set out in Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 637/2008 and Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 (“the Direct Payments Regulation”), which are beneficial for the climate and the environment.
These Regulations make derogations from certain provisions of the Direct Payments Regulation, disapplying the crop diversification requirements in Scotland for the claim year 2020. These derogations are considered necessary and justifiable in order to address problems caused by extreme weather experienced across Scotland in recent months.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992 (SI 1992/2977) (“the principal Regulations”). The principal Regulations concern the assessment of the ability of a person to pay for accommodation provided under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 (“the 1968 Act”). By virtue of section 87(3) of the 1968 Act, accommodation provided under the 1968 Act or section 25 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 is to be regarded as accommodation provided under Part III of the National Assistance Act 1948.
Regulation 2 amends schedule 4 of the principal Regulations to provide that certain payments are to be ignored as capital in the financial assessment of the resident’s resources. Any payment made to an individual in respect of neglect or abuse suffered by a person whilst they were a child under the care or responsibility of a body, society or organisation and while living in Scotland is to be ignored. Any payments made by a trust established for the purpose of giving relief and assistance to disabled people whose disabilities were caused by the fact that during their pregnancy their mother had taken the drug known as Thalidomide are to be ignored.

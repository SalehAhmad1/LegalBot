The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 1(1) of schedule 19 of the Coronavirus Act 2020(1) (“the Act”) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of coronavirus in Scotland.
The Scottish Ministers consider that the restrictions and requirements imposed by these Regulations are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with paragraph 6(2) and (3) of schedule 19 of the Act, the Scottish Ministers are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make these Regulations without a draft having been laid before, and approved by, a resolution of the Scottish Parliament.

At 11.55 a.m. on 3rd December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations (which come into force on 4 December 2020) amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions and Requirements) (Local Levels) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the principal regulations”).
Regulation 3 adds a new regulation 3B into the principal regulations to modify the application of the principal regulations during the period from and including 23 December 2020 to 27 December 2020.
Regulation 3B(1) modifies regulation 2 of the principal regulations to add a new definition of “holiday gathering” and modifies schedules 2 to 5 of the principal regulations so that attending a holiday gathering is an exception to the restrictions on gatherings in private dwellings in Level 1, 2, 3 and 4 areas and the restrictions on gatherings in outdoor public places in Level 2, 3 and 4 areas. It also modifies schedules 4, 5 and 7A of the principal regulations to add gathering as a holiday gathering to the list of examples of a purpose for which a contravention of the travel restrictions in Level 3 or 4 areas, or within the common travel area, will constitute a reasonable excuse. Regulation 3B(2) further modifies those schedules to make special provision for travel to or from Northern Ireland on 22 December 2020.
Regulation 3B(3) makes interpretative provision relevant to the modifications made by this regulation. Paragraphs (4) to (6) of that regulation make provision relative to the rules for reckoning the numbers involved in holiday gatherings, including to specify that a person may not attend more than one holiday gathering.
Regulation 4 amends schedule 5 of the principal Regulations to allow holiday accommodation in Level 4 areas to be provided to a person attending a marriage ceremony or civil partnership registration or to facilitate shared parenting arrangements.

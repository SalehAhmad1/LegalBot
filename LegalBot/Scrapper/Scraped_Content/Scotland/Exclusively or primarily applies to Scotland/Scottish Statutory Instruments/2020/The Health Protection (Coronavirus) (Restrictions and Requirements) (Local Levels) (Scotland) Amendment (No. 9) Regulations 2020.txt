The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 1(1) of schedule 19 of the Coronavirus Act 2020(1)(“the Act”) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of coronavirus in Scotland.
The Scottish Ministers consider that the restrictions and requirements imposed by these Regulations are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with paragraph 6(2) and (3) of schedule 19 of the Act, the Scottish Ministers are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make these Regulations without a draft having been laid before, and approved by, a resolution of the Scottish Parliament.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Restrictions and Requirements) (Local Levels) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the Local Levels Regulations”). These Regulations come into force on 26 December 2020.
Regulations 3 and 4 amend schedule 7A of the Local Levels Regulations so that the restrictions in relation to the common travel area apply to the whole of the Republic of Ireland rather than just County Donegal.
Regulations 5 and 6 amend schedule 5 of the Local Levels Regulations to alter premises which are required to close in a Level 4 area. Regulation 5 adds the following to the definition of a “listed business” in paragraph 1 of schedule 5: travel agencies, tanning salons or premises which operate self-tanning machines or spray-tan booths, and certain showrooms such as kitchen, bathroom, furniture or glazing showrooms.
Regulation 6 alters the list of retail premises that are exempt from the closure requirements in paragraph 2 of schedule 5. It omits garden centres and plant nurseries from that list and replaces “homeware, building supplies and hardware stores” with “building merchants and suppliers of products and tools used in building work and repairs”.

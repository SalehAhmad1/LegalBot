(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Free Prescriptions and Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Scotland) Regulations 2011 (S.S.I. 2011/55) (“the 2011 Regulations”). The 2011 Regulations provide that where a pharmacist provides pharmaceutical services to a patient who presents an English prescription form, that pharmacist must make and recover from the patient the charges specified in the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/570) (“the 2015 Regulations”) as in force at a specified date, unless certain exemptions apply.
Regulation 2 amends the 2011 Regulations so that the charge to be made and recovered reflects the rate specified by the 2015 Regulations as in force at 1 April 2020. The 2015 Regulations were amended by the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/201) to make the following charges applicable from 1 April 2020:
£9.15 per item, or £18.30 per pair, in relation to the supply of elastic hosiery,
£9.15 in relation to the supply of each other appliance, and
£9.15 in relation to the supply of each quantity of a drug.
Regulation 3 revokes the National Health Service (Free Prescriptions and Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2019 (S.S.I. 2019/145).

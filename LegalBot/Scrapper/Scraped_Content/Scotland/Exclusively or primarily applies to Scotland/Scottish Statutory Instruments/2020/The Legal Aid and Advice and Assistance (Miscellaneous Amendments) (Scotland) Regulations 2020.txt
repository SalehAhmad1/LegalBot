EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend existing legal aid regulations in Scotland in consequence of the Windrush Compensation Scheme (Expenditure) Act 2020 and the Scottish Child Payment Regulations 2020.
Regulation 2 amends the Advice and Assistance (Scotland) (Consolidation and Amendment) Regulations 1996, to provide that payments made from or in connection with the Windrush Compensation Scheme and Scottish child payments are disregarded by the Scottish Legal Aid Board (“SLAB”) in the assessment and computation of an applicant’s disposable capital and income in respect of payment of advice and assistance. This regulation also excludes such payments from bearing fees and outlays when forming part of any recovered or preserved property in proceedings.
Regulation 3 amends the Civil Legal Aid (Scotland) Regulations 2002, to provide that payments made from or in connection with the Windrush Compensation Scheme and Scottish child payments are disregarded by SLAB in the assessment and computation of an applicant’s disposable capital in respect of payment of civil legal aid. This regulation also excludes such payments from bearing fees and outlays when forming part of any recovered or preserved property in proceedings. Scottish child payments are also disregarded in the assessment and computation of an applicant’s disposable income.
Regulation 4 amends the Children’s Legal Assistance (Scotland) Regulations 2013, to provide that payments made from or in connection with the Windrush Compensation Scheme and Scottish child payments are to be disregarded by SLAB in the assessment and computation of an applicant’s disposable capital in respect of payment of children’s legal assistance. Scottish child payments are also disregarded in assessment and computation of an applicant’s disposable income.

19th February 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Non-Domestic Rating (Valuation of Utilities) (Scotland) Order 2005 (S.S.I. 2005/127, “the principal Order”).
Article 2(2) replaces a table in the principal Order which details companies to be regarded as “fixed line operators” for the purposes of entries in the valuation roll. The effect is that lands and heritages occupied by those operators are entered as a single entry in the valuation roll, despite being situated in different rating authority areas.
Article 2(3) makes provision for entries that have not been made in accordance with the provisions of the principal Order. It provides that the entry is valid, as is anything done in consequence of it, but requires the assessor designated by the principal Order to arrange to rectify the entry or entries.

Section 52 enables Scottish Ministers by regulations to make provision in connection with the making, amendment and revocation of exemption orders in relation to the parking prohibitions set out in Part 6 of the Act.
Sections 67 and 68 allow for the Scottish Ministers to provide direction or issue written guidance to local authorities in connection with the exercise of their functions under Part 6 of the Act.

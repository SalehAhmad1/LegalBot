(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Representation of the People (Annual Canvass) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1451) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
The 2019 Regulations make provision in relation to the reformed annual canvass in respect of a parliamentary register of electors and local government register of electors in England. Regulations 20 and 21 of the 2019 Regulations make provision for a data match that will allow registration officers to match the names and addresses of those registered in a register of parliamentary electors in Great Britain or a register of local government electors in England, against other data sources.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends regulation 20 of the 2019 Regulations to extend the data matching confirmation to a register of local government electors in Scotland.
The Scottish Government has prepared and is publishing on its website a Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment and an Equality Impact Assessment.

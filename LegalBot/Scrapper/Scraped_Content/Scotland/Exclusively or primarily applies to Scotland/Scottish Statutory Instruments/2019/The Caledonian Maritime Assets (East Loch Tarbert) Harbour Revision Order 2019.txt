The Scottish Ministers (the “Ministers”) make the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by section 14(1) and (3) of the Harbours Act 1964(1) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
In accordance with section 14(1) of that Act, this Order is made in relation to a harbour which is being improved, maintained or managed by a harbour authority in the exercise and performance of statutory powers and duties, for achieving objects specified in Schedule 2 to that Act(2).
In accordance with section 14(2) of that Act—
(a)
this Order is made following a written application to Ministers by Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited (“the applicant”) being the authority engaged in improving, maintaining or managing the harbour, and
(b)
the Ministers are satisfied that the making of this Order is desirable in the interests of securing the improvement, maintenance, or management of the harbour in an efficient and economical manner and facilitating the efficient and economic transport of goods and passengers by sea.
In accordance with paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 to that Act(3), Ministers have decided that the application relates to a project which falls within Annex II to Directive 2011/92/EU(4), of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment and, taking into account the criteria set out in Annex III to that Directive, that the project is a relevant project.
In accordance with paragraph 6 of that Schedule(5), Ministers have—
(a)
informed the applicant of that decision, and the reasons for it, and
(b)
given an opinion to the applicant about the extent of the information referred to in Annex IV to that Directive which the applicant would be required to supply in the environmental statement and—
(i)
in giving that opinion Ministers have taken into account the matters in sub‑paragraph (3) of that paragraph, and
(ii)
before giving that opinion Ministers have consulted the applicant and such bodies with environmental responsibilities as Ministers thought appropriate.
In accordance with paragraph 8 of that Schedule(6), Ministers have directed the applicant to supply them with an environmental statement and as required by paragraph 9 of that Schedule(7) the applicant has complied with that direction.
Notices have been published by the applicant in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 10 of that Schedule(8).
In accordance with paragraph 15 of that Schedule(9), Ministers have—
(a)
consulted, and
(b)
sent the environmental statement, and any further information falling within paragraph 10A(2) of that Schedule, to,
such bodies who were likely to have an interest in the project by reason of their environmental responsibilities as Ministers thought appropriate.
All objections to the application have been withdrawn or paragraph 18(1A) of that Schedule(10) applied in respect of those objections.
In accordance with paragraph 19(1) of that Schedule(11), Ministers have considered—
(a)
the environmental statement and the further information falling within paragraph 10A(2) of that Schedule,
(b)
the result of the consultations under paragraph 15 of that Schedule,
(c)
any objections made and not withdrawn,
(d)
any representations made under paragraph 10(2)(f), or 10A(4)(d) of that Schedule, and
(e)
any written representations submitted to Ministers by the applicant or any objector in elaboration of the application or, as the case may be, objection.
In accordance with paragraph 19(2) of that Schedule(12), Ministers have decided to make this Order with modifications which do not appear to Ministers substantially to affect the character of the Order.

(a)
article 10 (provision against danger to navigation),
(b)
article 12 (lights on tidal works during construction), and

A person guilty of an offence under section 14A of the 1981 Act is liable on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a fine not exceeding £40,000 or to both; and on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or an unlimited fine, or to both.

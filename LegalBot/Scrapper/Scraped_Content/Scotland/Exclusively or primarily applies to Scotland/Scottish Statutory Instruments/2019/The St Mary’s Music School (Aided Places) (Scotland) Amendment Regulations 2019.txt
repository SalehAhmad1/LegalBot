(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the St Mary’s Music School (Aided Places) (Scotland) Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”). These Regulations come into force on 1 August 2019.
The 2015 Regulations provide for the payment of allowances to St Mary’s Music School, Edinburgh, to reimburse it for its expenditure in respect of fees and charges remitted and grants made in operating the aided places scheme described in schedule 1 of those Regulations. These Regulations principally amend the remission levels in respect of boarders and day pupils who benefit from the aided places scheme.
Regulation 1 makes general provision for citation, commencement and interpretation.
Regulation 2 makes minor amendments to the 2015 Regulations in order to correct errors or clarify the meaning of existing provisions.
Regulation 3(2) corrects a drafting error. Regulation 3(3) and (4) amends the amount to be deducted from an applicant’s relevant income in respect of each dependent child or other relative for the purposes of calculation of the applicant’s relevant income.
Regulation 4(2) amends the income threshold below which no parental contribution is payable in respect of fees for boarders. Regulation 4(3) substitutes the table that sets out parental contribution levels for boarders by income band with two new tables, which will apply for the school year beginning in 2019 and school years beginning in 2020 and subsequent years, respectively.
Regulation 5(2) amends the income threshold below which no parental contribution is payable in respect of fees for day pupils. Regulation 5(3) substitutes the table that sets out parental contribution levels for day pupils by income band with two new tables, which will apply for the school year beginning in 2019 and school years beginning in 2020 and subsequent years, respectively.
Regulation 6(2) amends the parental income threshold below which an aided pupil is entitled to a clothing grant in the pupil’s first year at the school, and substitutes the table setting out the maximum amount of clothing grant payable by income band. Regulation 6(3) does the same for any subsequent year of an aided pupil at the school.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978 (“the 1978 Act”) and the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act”). They revoke and replace the instruments specified in schedule 2.
Section 3 of the 1978 Act requires a local authority to remove certain abandoned vehicles, section 4 enables the authority to dispose of such vehicles, and section 5 enables the authority to recover expenses in connection with removed vehicles.
Section 10(1) of the 1978 Act allows for different provision to be made for different circumstances.
Section 101 of the 1984 Act authorises the recovery of sums and section 102 authorises the recovery of charges in respect of the removal, storage and disposal of vehicles as may be prescribed.
Section 103(3) of the 1984 Act allows for different charges to be prescribed for different cases or classes of case.
Regulation 3 prescribes the amounts payable in respect of removal, retention and disposal of vehicles as set out in Parts 1 to 3 of schedule 1. The amount payable in respect of those matters is determined by the type or size of a vehicle, and by the circumstances under which it is removed. Regulation 3(3) also makes provision for additional charges for the removal of a vehicle in certain circumstances. A mileage charge of £1.10 per mile is applied where the operator is required to travel in excess of 40 miles in order to remove and retain a vehicle and a ferry charge of £125 is applied for every single journey by ferry the operator is required to make to remove and retain a vehicle.
Regulation 4 revokes the instruments listed in schedule 2.

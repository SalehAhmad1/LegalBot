These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 and paragraph 21(b) of schedule 7 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to subordinate legislation in the field of fertilisers and pesticides and, in particular, amend the EC Fertilisers (Scotland) Regulations 2006 and the Pesticides (Maximum Residue Levels) (Scotland) Regulations 2008.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

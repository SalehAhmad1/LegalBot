The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 M1 and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Scottish Ministers that it is expedient for the references to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 establishing uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and the Council, as regards protective measures against pests of plants, and repealing Commission Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 and amending Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 and to the European Union instruments mentioned in regulation 3(1) to be references to those instruments as amended from time to time.

a plant health inspector determines the extent of the probable contamination through pre- or post-harvest contact or through any production link with anything designated as contaminated under head (a), [F20having regard to the following factors—
(i)
the susceptible material grown at the contaminated place of production,
(ii)
places of production with some production link to that susceptible material, including those sharing production equipment and facilities directly or through a common contractor,

[F22(1A) When making a designation or determination under sub-paragraph (1), an inspector must have regard to sound scientific principles, the biology of Potato Ring Rot and relevant production, marketing and processing systems.]
(2) Where specified plant material has been designated as contaminated under sub-paragraph (1)(a), the Scottish Ministers must ensure that testing is carried out on potato stocks which are clonally related to that specified plant material in the manner specified in paragraph 27(2) of this schedule in order to determine the probable primary source of infection and the extent of the probable contamination.

The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972(1) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Scottish Ministers that it is expedient for—
(a)
any reference to an EU instrument defined in schedule 1 to be construed as a reference to that instrument as any Annex to it is amended from time to time, and
(b)
any reference to an EU instrument defined in schedules 3 or 4 to be construed as a reference to that instrument as amended from time to time.
There has been consultation as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(2).
(1)
1972 c.68. Section 2(2) was amended by paragraph 15(3) of schedule 8 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c.46) (“the 1998 Act”) (which was amended by section 27(4) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c.51) (“the 2006 Act”)). Section 2(2) was also amended by section 27(1)(a) of the 2006 Act and by section 3(3) and Part 1 of the schedule of the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c.7) (“the 2008 Act”). The functions conferred upon the Minister of the Crown under section 2(2), insofar as exercisable within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act. Paragraph 1A of schedule 2 was inserted by section 28 of the 2006 Act and was relevantly amended by Part 1 of the schedule of the 2008 Act. Section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of schedule 2 are prospectively repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) from exit day (see section 20 of that Act).

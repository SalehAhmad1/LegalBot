EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are principally made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 and paragraph 21(b) of schedule 7 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address deficiencies in EU-derived domestic legislation in Scotland arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Part 2 (regulation 2), made in exercise of powers under the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68), amends the Marketing of Vegetable Plant Material Regulations 1995 to implement a derogation available to Members States in Article 16 of Council Directive 2008/72/EC (OJ L 205, 1.8.2008, p.28-39) on the marketing of vegetable propagating and planting material, other than seed.
Part 3 (regulations 3 and 4) makes amendments to fix deficiencies in secondary legislation concerning the marketing of vegetable plant material and fruit plant and propagating material consequential on the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.
Part 4 (regulations 5 to 9) makes revocations. Regulation 5 revokes regulations 9(2)(a)(ix), 13(5)(c) and (d) and 16(7)(a) of the Seed and Propagating Material (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 in consequence of regulations 3 to 5 of the Seed and Propagating Material (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 which correct drafting errors identified in amendments made by the Seed and Propagating Material (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019, in fulfilment of a commitment to the Scottish Parliament to do so. Regulation 6 revokes regulation 7(4) of the Common Agricultural Policy (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 in consequence of the amendment to regulation 16(1)(d) of the Rural Development (Scotland) Regulations 2015 made by regulation 4 of the Common Agricultural Policy (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2019. Regulation 7 revokes regulation 3(13) of the Marketing of Horticultural Produce and Bananas (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 in consequence of the amendment to the Marketing of Horticultural Produce (Scotland) Regulations 2009 made by regulation 3 of the Common Agricultural Policy (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2019. Regulations 8 and 9 revoke respectively regulation 6 of the Seed and Propagating Material (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and Part 4 (regulations 5 and 6) of the Common Agricultural Policy (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 and are made in consequence of regulations 5, 6 and 7 of this instrument which make provision in place of those regulations.

27th February 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Non-Domestic Rating (Valuation of Utilities) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2019 (“the 2019 Order”).
That Order replaces a table in the Non-Domestic Rating (Valuation of Utilities) (Scotland) Order 2005 (S.S.I. 2005/127). The table details companies to be regarded as “fixed line operators” for the purposes of entries in the valuation roll. The effect is that specified lands and heritages occupied by those operators are entered as a single entry in the valuation roll for Renfrewshire, despite being situated in different rating authority areas.
This Order updates entries in the table in the 2019 Order, so that when it comes into force on 1 April 2019 it states accurately the names and registration numbers of the companies it details. Two entries are omitted, as a result of dissolution of the companies to which they related.

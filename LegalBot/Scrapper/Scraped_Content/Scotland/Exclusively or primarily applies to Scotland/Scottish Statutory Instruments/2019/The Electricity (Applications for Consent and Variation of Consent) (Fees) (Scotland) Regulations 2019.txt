(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in sections 36(8), 36C(2) and 60(3) and paragraph 1(3) of schedule 8 of the Electricity Act 1989 in order to introduce revised levels of fees in respect of applications for consents and variations to consents under the Electricity Act 1989.
Regulation 3 specifies the categories of applications for consent to which these Regulations apply. Regulation 4 and the schedule specify the level of fee payable to the Scottish Ministers in respect of the application.
Regulation 5 revokes regulation 11 of the Electricity (Applications for Consent) Regulations 1990 insofar as it applies to Scotland. These Regulations introduce revised levels of fees, replacing those set out in regulation 11 of the 1990 Regulations. Regulation 5(2) ensures that any application made before these Regulations come into force will be subject to regulation 11 of the 1990 Regulations.

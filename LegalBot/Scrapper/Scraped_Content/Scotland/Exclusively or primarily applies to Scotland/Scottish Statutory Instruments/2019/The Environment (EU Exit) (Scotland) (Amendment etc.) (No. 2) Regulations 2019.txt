(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraphs 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 and paragraph 21(b) of schedule 7 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation relating to waste and the protection of the environment to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(d) and (g) of that Act), arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Part 2 amends the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 and Part 3 amends subordinate legislation concerning waste.
Part 4 and the schedule contain revocations. The schedule revokes subordinate legislation in consequence of amendments made to the Pollution Prevention Control Act by Part 2 of the Environment (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and to the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 by these Regulations.
A business and regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

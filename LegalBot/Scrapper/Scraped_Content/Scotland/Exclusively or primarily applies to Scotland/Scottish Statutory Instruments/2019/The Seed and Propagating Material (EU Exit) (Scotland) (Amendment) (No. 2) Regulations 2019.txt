EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are principally made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular, those mentioned in section 8(2)(a), (c), (d) and (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Part 2 (regulation 2), made in exercise of powers under the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68), amends the Marketing of Fruit Plant and Propagating Material (Scotland) Regulations 2017 in implementation of Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/120 (OJ L 24, 28.1.2019, p.27), which amends Article 12(2) of Council Directive 2008/90/EC (OJ L 267, 8.10.2008, p.8), to extend the derogation available to Member States relating to import conditions for fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production from third countries. This extends that derogation from 31 December 2018 until 31 December 2022.
Part 3 makes amendments to secondary legislation concerning the marketing of vegetable and cereal seed and seed potatoes, consequential on the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. Regulations 3 to 5 correct drafting errors identified in amendments made by the Seed and Propagating Material (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 and fulfil a commitment to the Scottish Parliament to do so. In consequence, regulation 6 revokes regulations 9(2)(a)(ix), 13(5)(c) and (d) and 16(7)(a) of the Seed and Propagating Material (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019.
A business and regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

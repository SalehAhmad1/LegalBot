Coming into force

The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2), and paragraph 1A of schedule 2, of the European Communities Act 1972(1), and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Scottish Ministers that it is expedient for references in these Regulations to the Animal Breeding Regulation (as defined in regulation 1(3)(b)) to be construed as references to that instrument as amended from time to time.
(1)
1972 c.68. Section 2(2) was amended by paragraph 15(3) of schedule 8 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c.46) (“the 1998 Act”) (which was amended by section 27(4) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c.51) (“the 2006 Act”)). Section 2(2) was also amended by section 27(1)(a) of the 2006 Act and by section 3(3) and Part 1 of the schedule of the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c.7). The functions conferred upon the Minister of the Crown under section 2(2), insofar as exercisable within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act. Paragraph 1A of schedule 2 was inserted by section 28 of the 2006 Act and was amended by the 2008 Act, schedule, Part 1.Citation, commencement, extent and interpretation
1.—(1) These Regulations may be cited as the Zootechnical Standards (Scotland) Regulations 2019 and come into force on 7 March 2019.
(2) These Regulations extend to Scotland and, in so far as they extend beyond Scotland, they do so only as a matter of Scots law(1).
(3) In these Regulations—
(a)
expressions used in these Regulations have the same meaning as in the Animal Breeding Regulation, unless the context otherwise requires,
(b)
“the Animal Breeding Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2016/1012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on zootechnical and genealogical conditions for the breeding, trade in and entry into the Union of purebred breeding animals, hybrid breeding pigs and the germinal products thereof and amending Regulation (EU) No 652/2014, Council Directives 89/608/EEC and 90/425/EEC and repealing certain acts in the area of animal breeding, as amended from time to time(2).
(1)
These Regulations apply to breed societies and breeding operations recognised by the Scottish Ministers as the competent authority, and the breeding programmes (also approved by that competent authority) may under Article 12 of Regulation (EU) 2016//1012 (OJ L 171, 29.6.2016, p.66) extend to animals kept in another Member State. In particular, sanctions applied under Article 47 of that Regulation (such as suspension of a breeding programme or withdrawal of recognition of a breed society or breeding organisation) may affect animals being bred in another Member State under a breeding programme approved by the Scottish Ministers. And, under Article 48 of that Regulation, the Scottish Ministers as competent authority may, if necessary, undertake official controls in that other Member State.

15th January 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in Scotland for the implementation and administration of Regulation (EU) 2016/1012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on zootechnical and genealogical conditions for the breeding, trade in and entry into the Union of purebred breeding animals, hybrid breeding pigs and the germinal products thereof (“the Animal Breeding Regulation”) (OJ L 171, 29.6.2016, p.66).
Regulation 2 designates the Scottish Ministers as the competent authority for the purposes of the Animal Breeding Regulation.
Regulation 3 provides that the competent authority is responsible for the enforcement of the Animal Breeding Regulation in Scotland.
Regulation 4 provides that notices served by the competent authority on operators may be sent by post or in electronic form and provides certain requirements which must be met in order for a notice sent in electronic form to be treated as given. The term operator is defined in the Animal Breeding Regulation as any natural or legal person subject to the rules provided for in the Animal Breeding Regulation.
Regulation 5 makes provision for an obligation on an operator to inform the competent authority of changes to the contact details of that operator.
Regulation 6 provides for penalties in the event that an operator infringes its obligations under the Animal Breeding Regulation.
Regulation 7 provides a mechanism whereby breed societies and breeding operations may apply to the competent authority for a reconsideration of a decision to withdraw the recognition of that breed society or breeding operation under Article 47 of the Animal Breeding Regulation.
Regulation 8 amends the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (“the TARP (Scotland) Regulations”). The TARP Scotland Regulations govern the import of live animals and products of animal origin into Scotland from outside the EU. Regulation 13 of the TARP Scotland Regulations provides for certain checks which must be carried out on such consignments at Border Inspection Posts (“BIPs”). The Commission periodically publishes lists of BIPs. The list of approved BIPs is laid down in Commission Decision 2009/821/EC (OJ L 296, 12.11.2009, p.1) as last amended by Commission Implementing Decision 2011/707/EU (OJ 281, 28.10.2011, p.29) and is periodically reviewed and amendments made.
Article 37 of the Animal Breeding Regulation makes provision for checks to be carried out at BIPs in relation to pure bred animals. Regulation 13 of the TARP Scotland Regulations is amended by regulation 8 of this instrument so that the checks required by Article 37 of the Animal Breeding Regulation are included in the carried out under that regulation. Regulation 8 also makes consequential amendments to the TARP Scotland Regulations, namely regulation 2 (Interpretation) and schedule 1 (European Union Legislation).
Regulation 9 makes revocations consequential on the coming into force of the Animal Breeding Regulation.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

At 12.45 p.m. on 17th December 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Restriction of Liberty Order etc. (Scotland) Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”). Regulation 2(2) revokes two obsolete definitions from Regulation 2 of the 2013 Regulations as movement restriction conditions are no longer referred to in the 2013 Regulations and, following the amendment of Schedule 2, Serco Geografix will no longer be referred to.
Regulation 2(3) removes Regulation 6 from the 2013 Regulations as it is no longer required. Regulation 6 made amendments to the Intensive Support and Monitoring (Scotland) Regulations 2008 (SSI 2008/75) and those Regulations were in turn revoked by Regulation 1 of the Children’s Hearings (Scotland) Act 2011 (Movement Restriction Conditions) Regulations 2013 (SSI 2013/210) (“the MRC Regulations”).
Regulation 2(4) substitutes a new Schedule 2 into the 2013 Regulations. Schedule 2 of the 2013 Regulations specifies devices which may be used for the purposes of remotely monitoring an individual’s compliance with—
a)
a restriction of liberty order made under section 245A of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (“the 1995 Act”),
b)
a restricted movement requirement as defined in section 227ZF(1) of the 1995 Act,
c)
requirements imposed under section 234CA(1) of the 1995 Act as part of a drug treatment and testing order,
d)
requirements imposed under section 230A(1) of the 1995 Act as part of a probation order,
e)
a curfew condition as defined in section 12AB(1) of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993, and
f)
a condition specified by virtue of section 40(2) of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003.
Regulation 2(4) replaces Schedule 2 of the 2013 Regulations in order to specify a new list of devices which may be used for these purposes.
Sections 228 to 234 of the 1995 Act (probation) were repealed by paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010. However, savings provisions in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 (Commencement No. 6, Transitional and Savings Provisions) Order 2010 (SSI 2010/413) retained probation orders for offences committed before 1st February 2011.
Section 150 of the Children’s Hearings (Scotland) Act 2011 enables the Scottish Ministers to prescribe the devices which may be used for monitoring compliance with a movement restriction condition imposed on a child as part of a compulsory supervision order. This power has been exercised in the MRC Regulations.
Regulation 8 of the MRC Regulations specifies devices for the purposes of section 150 of the 2011 Act via a cross-reference to Schedule 2 of the 2013 Regulations. Accordingly, the changes being made in these Regulations to Schedule 2 of the 2013 Regulations will mean that new devices are specified for the purposes of section 150 of the 2011 Act via the cross-reference in Regulation 8 of the MRC Regulations.

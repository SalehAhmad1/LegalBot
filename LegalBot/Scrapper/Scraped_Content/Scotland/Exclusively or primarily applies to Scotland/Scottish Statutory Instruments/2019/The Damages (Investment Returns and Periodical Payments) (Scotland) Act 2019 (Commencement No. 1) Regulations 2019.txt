Regulation 3 amends the text of schedule B1 of the Damages Act 1996 Act where it contains references to the day on which the schedule of the 2019 Act comes into force. The text is amended to refer directly to 1 July 2019.
The Bill for the 2019 Act received Royal Assent on 24 April 2019. Sections 8, 9 and 10 came into force on the following day.

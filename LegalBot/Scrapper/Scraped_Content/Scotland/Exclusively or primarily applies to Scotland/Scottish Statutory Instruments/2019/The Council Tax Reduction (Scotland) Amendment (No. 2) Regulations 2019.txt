EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Council Tax Reduction (Scotland) Regulations 2012 and the Council Tax Reduction (State Pension Credit) (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (“the principal Regulations”).
The amendments add references to payments under the Discretionary Financial Assistance Regulations 2001 (“the 2001 Regulations”) to lists of payments that local authorities must disregard in the calculation of income and capital for the purposes of the principal Regulations.
The Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (asp 9) provides for local authorities to have the power to make discretionary housing payments under provisions in that Act, once they are commenced. The principal Regulations were amended by the Council Tax Reduction (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2019 (S.S.I. 2019/29) to ensure that any such payments are disregarded in council tax calculations. The amendments made by these Regulations will ensure that any payments made under the 2001 Regulations will also be disregarded in such calculations.

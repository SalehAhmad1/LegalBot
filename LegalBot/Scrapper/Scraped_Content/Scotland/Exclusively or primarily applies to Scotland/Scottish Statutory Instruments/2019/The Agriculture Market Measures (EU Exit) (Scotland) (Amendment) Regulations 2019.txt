The Agriculture Market Measures (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019
Made
26th February 2019
Laid before the Scottish Parliament
27th February 2019
Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1
The Scottish Ministers make these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 M1, and section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 M2, and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, and it appears to the Scottish Ministers that it is expedient for references in these Regulations to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1185 to be construed as references to that Regulation as amended from time to time.
There has been consultation as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety M3, during the preparation and evaluation of these Regulations so far as they relate to food.

EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are in general made by the Scottish Ministers in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraphs 1(1) and (3) of Schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16), in order to address failures of EU derived domestic law to operate effectively and other deficiencies as regards Scotland that would otherwise arise as a result of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Regulations 2 and 5(3)(a) and (b) are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972, in order to correct before the date of withdrawal cross-references to European Union instruments in Scottish legislation.
These Regulations make amendments in the field of common market organisations for certain agricultural products.
Regulation 2 updates cross-references to EU instruments in the Reporting of Prices of Milk Products (Scotland) Regulations 2005.
Regulations 3 to 5 both update cross-references and fix deficiencies in the Scottish statutory instruments that implement or relate to EU measures providing for marketing standards and related measures as regards Quality Meat Scotland, beef and pig carcasses, and beef and veal labelling.

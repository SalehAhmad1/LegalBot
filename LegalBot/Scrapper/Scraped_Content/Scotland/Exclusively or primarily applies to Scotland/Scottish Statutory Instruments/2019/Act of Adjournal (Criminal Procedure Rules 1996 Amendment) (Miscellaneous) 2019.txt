(This note is not part of the Act of Adjournal)
This Act of Adjournal amends Chapter 14 (procedure at trial in solemn proceedings) and Chapter 33 (legal aid) of the Criminal Procedure Rules 1996.
Paragraph 2(2) amends rule 14.1A(1) to provide that the requirement that there be at least 30 jurors present for balloting of the jury to commence is fulfilled whether the jurors are in the courtroom or assembled elsewhere in the court building.
Paragraph 2(3) amends the cross-heading and text of rule 33.6 to reflect the fact that the rule applies to a range of proceedings, and not just to proceedings in respect of a sexual offence.
This Act of Adjournal comes into force on 13th November 2019.

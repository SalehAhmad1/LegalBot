(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Conservation of Salmon (Scotland) Regulations 2016 (“the principal Regulations”), which make provision to regulate the killing of salmon in specified areas.
Regulation 2 makes minor amendments to the principal Regulations. Regulation 2(2) and (3) relate to the removal of regulation 3(2A) from the principal Regulations. Regulation 3(2A) makes specific provision in relation to the River Ness. This provision is no longer required as the River Ness is now excluded from the list of inland waters listed in schedule 2 (Inland Waters: Prohibition on Retaining Salmon) as substituted by regulation 2(4).
Schedule 2 describes the areas of inland waters where there is a prohibition on the retention of any salmon caught.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment in relation to this Order has been prepared and placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Copies of it can be obtained from Marine Scotland, Victoria Quay, Leith, Edinburgh EH6 6QQ and online at www.legislation.gov.uk.

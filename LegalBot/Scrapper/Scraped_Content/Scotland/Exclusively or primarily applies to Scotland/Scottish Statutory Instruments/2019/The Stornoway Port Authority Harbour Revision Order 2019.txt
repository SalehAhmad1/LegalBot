The Stornoway Port Authority Harbour Revision Order 2019
Made
28th February 2019
Coming into force
1st March 2019
The Scottish Ministers (the “Ministers”) make the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by section 14(1), (2A) and (3) of the Harbours Act 1964 M1 and all other powers enabling Ministers to do so.
In accordance with section 14(1) of that Act, this Order is made in relation to a harbour which is being improved, maintained or managed by a harbour authority in the exercise and performance of statutory powers and duties, for achieving objects specified in schedule 2 of that Act M2.
In accordance with section 14(2) of that Act—
(a)
this Order is made following a written application to Ministers by Stornoway Port Authority (“the applicant”) being the authority engaged in improving, maintaining or managing the harbour, and
(b)
(except in so far as this Order is made for achieving objects mentioned in section 14(2A) of that Act), Ministers are satisfied that the making of this Order is desirable in the interests of securing the improvement, maintenance, or management of the harbour in an efficient and economical manner, facilitating the efficient and economic transport of goods or passengers by sea and the recreational use of sea-going ships.
In accordance with section 14(2A) of that Act, the objects for achieving which this Order is made include repealing superseded, obsolete or otherwise unnecessary statutory provisions of local application affecting the harbour and consolidating any statutory provisions of local application affecting the harbour.
In accordance with paragraph 4 of schedule 3 of that Act M3, Ministers have decided that the part of the application relating to works at Newton Marina is a project which falls within Annex II to Council Directive 2011/92/EU M4 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment and, taking into account the criteria set out in Annex III to that Directive, that the project is a relevant project.
Ministers have decided that the part of the application relating to works at Arnish Deep Water Port is a project which falls within Annex I to that Directive.
In accordance with paragraph 20D of that schedule M5, Ministers have made a deferral direction because Ministers are satisfied that an assessment of the effects on the environment of the project in question has been, is being, or will be carried out by another consenting authority. Accordingly, the steps referred to in paragraph 20E(1) of that schedule do not require to be carried out.
Notice has been published in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 10 of that schedule. All objections to the application have been withdrawn.
In accordance with paragraph 19(2) of that schedule, Ministers have decided to make this Order with modifications which do not appear to Ministers substantially to affect the character of the Order.

EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made principally in exercise of the powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 to address deficiencies in EU-derived domestic legislation in Scotland arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of horticulture.
Part 2 (regulation 2), made in exercise of powers under the European Communities Act 1972, makes a technical amendment to secondary legislation concerning horticulture to give effect to EU law, to update a reference to an EU Regulation.
Part 3 (regulations 3 and 4), made in exercise of powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, makes amendments to secondary legislation concerning horticulture consequential on the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

(2) The Scottish Ministers may revoke a determination made under paragraph (1).
(3) Before making a determination under paragraph (1) or revoking a determination under paragraph (2), the Scottish Ministers must consult the requisite bodies, except where they consider it inappropriate to do so in any case on account of the nature of an emergency or grave danger.

is not listed as hazardous in the List of Wastes, or

though of a type listed as hazardous waste in the List of Wastes, is treated as non-hazardous pursuant to regulation 2ZC,
displays one or more of the hazardous properties, and accordingly that it shall be treated for all purposes as hazardous waste.
(2) A specific batch of waste produced in Wales, England or Northern Ireland and not listed as hazardous in the List of Wastes, which is for the time being determined to be hazardous as referred to in paragraph (3) shall, subject to any determination made under regulation 2ZC, be treated for all purposes as hazardous waste in Scotland.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2), a specific batch of waste may be determined to be hazardous—
(a)
in relation to Wales—

(3) A specific batch of waste produced in Wales, England or Northern Ireland and listed as a hazardous waste in the List of Wastes, and which is for the time being determined to be non-hazardous as referred to in paragraph (4) shall, subject to any determination made under regulation 2ZB, be treated for all purposes as non-hazardous in Scotland.

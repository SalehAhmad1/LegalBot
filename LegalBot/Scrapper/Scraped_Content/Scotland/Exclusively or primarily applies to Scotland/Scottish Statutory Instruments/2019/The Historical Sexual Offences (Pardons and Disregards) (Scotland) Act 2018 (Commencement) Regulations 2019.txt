(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force on 15 October 2019 those provisions of the Historical Sexual Offences (Pardons and Disregards) (Scotland) Act 2018 (“the Act”), which are not already in force.
The Act provides for pardons for those convicted of certain historical sexual offences relating to consensual sexual activity between men and for a scheme enabling individuals to apply for such convictions to be disregarded (Parts 2 and 3 of the Act). References to disregarded convictions will be removed from certain official records (section 10 of the Act), ensuring that they are not revealed in connection with disclosure checks of that person’s background.
The Bill for the Act received Royal Assent on 11 July 2018. Sections 15 to 18 came into force the following day.

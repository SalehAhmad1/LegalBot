1st April 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Disabled Persons (Badges for Motor Vehicles) (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (“the 2000 Regulations”).
The 2000 Regulations provide for a form of disabled person’s badge to be issued in Scotland in line with a Community model parking card as recommended for use by Council Recommendation 98/376/EC of 4 June 1998 on a parking card for people with disabilities.
The amendments prescribe a new form of disabled person’s badge and make other provision in connection with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The Regulations also amend the Local Authorities’ Traffic Orders (Exemptions for Disabled Persons) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 to remove a reference to the United Kingdom as a Member State.
The provisions relating to the new form of badge come into force on 1 April 2019 and the other provisions come into force on exit day (within the meaning of section 20(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16)).

The Queen’s Most Excellent Majesty in Council
This Order is made under the powers in section 179(1) and (2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992(1), which provide that, for the purpose of giving effect to any agreement with the government of a country outside the United Kingdom providing for reciprocity in specified matters, Her Majesty may by Order in Council make provision for modifying and adapting specified legislation in its application to cases affected by such agreement or proposed alterations.
At Dublin, on 1 February 2019, a Convention on Social Security between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland(2) was signed on behalf of those Governments. This Convention, which is referred to in this Order as “the Convention”, provides for existing reciprocal rights in the field of social security, enjoyed by British and Irish citizens (and certain family members and survivors) under the “Common Travel Area” arrangements(3) and the law of the European Union, to be protected following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Article 65 of the Convention provides that the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland shall notify each other in writing when the necessary internal procedures for entry into force have been completed. The Convention shall enter into force on the date of the later of such notifications.
In order to give effect to the Convention, therefore, Her Majesty, in exercise of the powers conferred on Her by section 179(1) and (2) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and of all other powers enabling Her to do so, is pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to order as follows:
(1)
1992 c.5. Section 179 is to be amended by S.I. 2019/128 with effect from exit day and there are other amendments that are not relevant to this Order. Legislative competence for some welfare benefits was devolved to the Scottish Parliament by Part 3 of the Scotland Act 2016 (c.11), which inserted exceptions into the Scotland Act 1998 (c.46), schedule 5, Part 2, Section F1. This devolution is subject to transitional arrangements set out in S.I. 2017/444. By virtue of section 27(2) of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (asp 10), the function of Her Majesty of making an Order in Council, so far as the function is exercisable within devolved competence, is exercisable by a Scottish Statutory Instrument.

Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes provision for the modification of social security legislation, so far as it relates to devolved matters, so as to give effect to the Convention on Social Security between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland in Dublin signed on 1 February 2019 (“the Convention”). It does so by applying the modification provided for by article 2(1) of the Social Security (Ireland) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/622) (“the 2019 Order”), where the legislation being modified relates to a matter which falls within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, and in relation to which competence for the exercise of functions has transferred to the Scottish Ministers.
The Convention is set out in the schedule of the 2019 Order and provides for existing reciprocal rights in the field of social security, provided under the Common Travel Area arrangements and the law of the European Union, to be protected in respect of British and Irish citizens (and certain family members and survivors) moving between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (“EU Withdrawal”).
The Order does not impose any costs on business, charities or the voluntary sector. Accordingly, no Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared.

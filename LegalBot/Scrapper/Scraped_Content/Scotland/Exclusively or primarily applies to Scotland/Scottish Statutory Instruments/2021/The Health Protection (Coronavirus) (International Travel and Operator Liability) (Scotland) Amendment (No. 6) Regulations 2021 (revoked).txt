(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (International Travel and Operator Liability) (Scotland) Regulations 2021 (“the International Travel Regulations”).
Regulation 3 amends regulation 14 of the International Travel Regulations to enable the use of lateral flow device tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in persons who are eligible vaccinated arrivals as an alternative to existing requirements to undertake day 2 polymerase chain reaction tests.
Regulation 4 inserts new regulations 16A and 16B into the International Travel Regulations to deal with circumstances arising in cases enabled by the amendments to regulation 14 described above. New regulation 16A provides for the notification of the results of self-administered tests. New regulation 16B requires a person to undertake a confirmatory test where the conditions set out in that regulation are met.
Regulation 5 makes consequential amendments to regulation 30 of the International Travel Regulations, arising from the insertion of new regulations 16A and 16B.
Regulation 6 amends the list of red list countries in schedule 1 of the International Travel Regulations.
Regulation 7 amends schedule 1A of the International Travel Regulations. It adds to the list of countries which are “relevant countries” meaning that persons who receive vaccines in those countries can count as “eligible vaccinated arrivals” for the purposes of the International Travel Regulations.

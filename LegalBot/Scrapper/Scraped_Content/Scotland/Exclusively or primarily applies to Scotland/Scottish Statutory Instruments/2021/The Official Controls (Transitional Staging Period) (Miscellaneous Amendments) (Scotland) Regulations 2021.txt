(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Official Controls (Extension of Transitional Periods) Regulations 2021 (“the 2021 Regulations”) and the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Scotland) Regulations 2012 (“the 2012 Regulations”). The amendments relate to official controls on certain animals and goods which originate from certain third countries during the transitional staging period provided for by Annex 6 to Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (EUR 2017/625).
Regulation 2 amends regulation 2 of the 2021 Regulations, which appoints the end date for the transitional staging period as 28 February 2022, but appoints earlier dates in respect of certain checks for certain products. Regulation 2 of the 2021 Regulations is amended to provide that the transitional staging period will not end on earlier dates in respect of checks for products of animal origin, germinal products, animal by-products and derived products, and that for those products the transitional staging period, including in respect of checks, will end on 28 February 2022.
Regulation 3 amends schedule 5 of the 2012 Regulations. Schedule 5 of the 2012 Regulations was made in exercise of powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union and makes provision regarding the importation of animals and related products during the transitional staging period. Regulation 3 amends paragraphs 4(6)(a) and 5(5) of schedule 5 of the 2012 Regulations to provide that during the transitional staging period official controls need not take place at the place of destination indicated in the relevant accompanying importation documentation, and that notification of importation through the appropriate computerised information system be given to the authority responsible for performing official controls at the place where official controls are to be carried out.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Abortion (Scotland) Regulations 1991 (“1991 Regulations”).
Regulation 3 substitutes a new regulation 4 in the 1991 Regulations. This requires any registered medical practitioner (“practitioner”) who terminates a pregnancy in Scotland to give notice of that termination to the Chief Medical Officer of the Scottish Administration (“CMO”). The notice must be given to the CMO before the fifteenth day of the calendar month immediately following the calendar month in which the practitioner terminated the pregnancy, rather than within 7 days as previously. The notice must state the name of the practitioner who terminated the pregnancy, and the name of the practitioner’s employer.
Regulation 4 revokes schedule 2 of the 1991 Regulations, removing from use the form of notice and other prescribed information relating to the termination that was contained in that schedule.

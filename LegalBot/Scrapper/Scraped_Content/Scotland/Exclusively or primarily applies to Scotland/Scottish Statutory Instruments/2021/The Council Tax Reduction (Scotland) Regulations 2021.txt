51.—(1) This regulation applies for the purpose of calculating earned income that is not employed earnings and is derived from carrying on a trade, profession or vocation (“self-employed earnings”).
(2) Where the applicant or the applicant’s partner has, or the partners jointly have, an award of universal credit, an applicant’s self-employed earnings in respect of an assessment period are to be calculated in accordance with the steps in this paragraph, and in accordance with paragraphs (3) and (4)—
Step 1
Calculate the amount of the applicant’s profit or loss in respect of each trade, profession or vocation carried on by the applicant by—
(a)
taking the actual receipts in that assessment period, and
(b)
deducting any amounts allowed as expenses under regulation 53 or 54.
Where a trade, profession or vocation is carried on in a partnership, take the amount of the profit or loss attributable to the applicant’s share in the partnership.
Step 2
If the applicant has carried on more than one trade, profession or vocation in the assessment period, add together the amounts resulting from step 1 in respect of each trade, profession or vocation.
Step 3
Deduct from the amount resulting from step 1 or (where applicable) step 2 any payment made by the applicant to HMRC in the assessment period by way of national insurance contributions or income tax in respect of any trade, profession or vocation carried on by the applicant.
If the amount resulting from steps 1 to 3 is nil or a negative amount, the amount of the applicant’s self-employed earnings in respect of the assessment period is nil (and ignore the following steps).
Step 4
If the amount resulting from step 3 is greater than nil, deduct from that amount any relievable pension contributions made by the applicant in the assessment period (unless a deduction has been made in respect of those contributions in calculating the applicant’s employed earnings).
If the amount resulting from this step is nil or a negative amount, the applicant’s self-employed earnings in respect of the assessment period are nil (and ignore the following steps).
Step5
Where the amount resulting from step 4 is greater than nil, deduct from that amount any unused losses (see regulation 52), taking the oldest first, and proceed to step 6.
If the amount resulting from this step is nil or a negative amount, the applicant’s self-employed earnings in respect of the assessment period are nil (and ignore the following step).
Step 6
Deduct from the amount any sum, where applicable, specified in schedule 3.
If the amount resulting is greater than nil, that is the amount of the applicant’s self-employed earnings for the assessment period.
If the amount resulting from this step is nil or a negative amount, the amount of the applicant’s self-employed earnings in respect of the assessment period is nil.
(3) The receipts referred to in paragraph (2) include receipts in kind and any refund or repayment of income tax, value added tax or national insurance contributions relating to the trade, profession or vocation.
(4) For the purposes of paragraph (2), where the purchase of an asset has been deducted as an expense in any assessment period and, in a subsequent assessment period, the asset is sold or ceases to be used for the purposes of a trade, profession or vocation carried on by the applicant, the proceeds of sale (or, as the case may be, the amount that would be received for the asset if it were sold at its current market value) are to be treated as a receipt in that subsequent assessment period
(5) If neither the applicant nor the applicant’s partner, nor the partners jointly, have an award of universal credit, the applicant’s self-employed earnings are to be calculated in accordance with [F1paragraphs (6) to (11)].
(6) For the purpose of paragraph (5) step 1 is to ascertain the gross income of the employment as a self-employed earner, but excluding—
(a)
any payment to which paragraph 30 or 31 of schedule 4 of the 2012 Regulations refers (payments in respect of a person accommodated with the applicant under arrangements made by a local authority or voluntary organisation and payments made to the applicant by a health authority, local authority or voluntary organisation in respect of persons temporarily in the applicant’s care),
(b)
any sports award within the meaning of regulation 10(9).
(7) This paragraph applies to—
(a)
royalties or other sums paid as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, design, patent or trade mark, and
(b)
any payment in respect of any—
(i)
book registered under the Public Lending Right Scheme 1982(1), or
(ii)
work made under any international public lending right scheme that is analogous to the Public Lending Right Scheme 1982, where the applicant is the first owner of the copyright, design, patent or trade mark, or an original contributor to the book or work concerned.
(8) For the purpose of paragraph (6), where the applicant’s earnings consist of any items to which paragraph (7) applies, those earnings are to be taken into account over a period equal to the number of weeks equal to the number obtained (and any fraction is to be treated as a corresponding fraction of a week) by dividing the earnings by the amount of council tax reduction to which the applicant would have been entitled had the payment not been made plus an amount equal to the total of the sums which would fall to be disregarded from the payment under schedule 3 (sums to be disregarded in the calculation of earnings) as appropriate in the applicant’s case.
(9) For the purpose of paragraph (5), steps 2 and 3 in calculating that applicant’s self-employed earnings are to ascertain the net profit of the employment as self-employed earnings, in accordance with regulations 37 and 38 (calculation of net profit, and deduction of tax and contributions) of the 2012 Regulations(2), but—
(a)
reading all references in those regulations to—
(i)
the “applicant” as referring to the applicant under these Regulations,
(ii)
the “assessment period” as referring to the assessment period determined under regulation 44 of these Regulations,
(iii)
“earnings” as referring to the gross income ascertained under Step 1 of this regulation,
(iv)

(b)
reading the reference in regulation 37(2) of those Regulations to “Schedule 3” as a reference to schedule 3 of these Regulations.
(10) If the amount resulting from the steps 2 and 3 in paragraph (9) is a nil or negative amount, the amount of the applicant’s self-employed earnings in respect of the assessment period is nil, otherwise those earnings as to be calculated in accordance with step 4 in paragraph (11).
(11) For the purpose of paragraph (5), step 4 is to deduct from the amount obtained from steps 2 and 3 any sum, where applicable, specified in schedule 3, and if the amount resulting from that step—
(a)
is greater than nil, that is the amount of the applicant’s self-employed earnings for the assessment period,
(b)
is nil or a negative amount, the amount of the applicant’s self-employed earnings in respect of the assessment period is nil.

(i)
that week is a week subsequent to the relevant week, and
(ii)
that relevant week is a week in which the condition in paragraph (4) is satisfied,
is to be reduced by the amount determined under paragraph (4).
(2) This paragraph applies to a reduction week or part-week where the applicant satisfies the conditions that—
(a)
the applicant is in receipt of council tax reduction, and
(b)
but for regulation 71(1), the applicant would have received an additional amount of council tax reduction in that week.
(3) In a case to which paragraph (2) applies, the amount of the reduction for the purposes of paragraph (1)(a) is equal to the aggregate of—
(a)
the additional amount to which paragraph (2)(b) refers,
(b)
where the applicant has also claimed housing benefit, the amount of any housing benefit or any additional amount of that benefit to which the applicant would have been entitled in respect of the whole or part of the reduction week to which paragraph (2) refers but for the application of regulation 49(1) of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (notional capital)(1),

(4) Subject to paragraph (5), for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) the condition is that the applicant would have been entitled to council tax reduction in the relevant week but for regulation 71(1) (notional capital), and in such a case the amount of the reduction is to be equal to the aggregate of the following amounts—
(a)
the amount of council tax reduction to which the applicant would have been entitled in the relevant week but for regulation 71(1), and for the purposes of this sub-paragraph if the amount is in respect of a part-week, that amount is to be determined by dividing the amount of council tax reduction to which the applicant would have been entitled by the number equal to the number of days in the part-week and multiplying the quotient by 7,
(b)
if the applicant would, but for a provision listed in paragraph (3)(b) to (e) have been entitled to housing benefit, income support, jobseeker’s allowance or employment and support allowance or to an additional amount of housing benefit, income support, jobseeker’s allowance or employment and support allowance in respect of the reduction week which includes the last day of the relevant week, the amount which is equal to—
(i)

(ii)
in any other case, the amount equal to the additional amount of housing benefit, income support, jobseeker’s allowance or employment and support allowance to which the applicant would have been entitled, and, for the purposes of this sub-paragraph, if the amount is in respect of a part-week, that amount is to be determined by dividing the amount of housing benefit, income support, jobseeker’s allowance or employment and support allowance to which the applicant would have been entitled by the number equal to the number of days in the part-week and multiplying the quotient by 7.
(5) The amount determined under paragraph (4) is to be re-determined under that paragraph if the applicant makes a further application for council tax reduction and the conditions in paragraph (6) are satisfied, and in such a case—
(a)
paragraph (4)(a) and (b) applies as if for “relevant week” there was substituted “relevant subsequent week”, and
(b)
subject to paragraph (7), the amount as re-determined has effect from the first week following the relevant subsequent week in question.
(6) The conditions are that—
(a)
a further application is made 26 or more weeks after the latest of—

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for a reduction in liability to council tax (“council tax reduction”) from 1 April 2022 for a person who has not reached pensionable age, or who has reached that age where they or their partner are in receipt of specified social security benefits (see regulation 3). Provision relating to council tax reduction for other persons who have reached pensionable age was made by the Council Tax Reduction (State Pension Credit) (Scotland) Regulations 2012.
Part 1 of the Regulations makes general provision, in particular in relation to the interpretation of the Regulations. Regulation 2 provides that the Regulations come into effect from the start of the 2022/23 financial year.
Part 2 deals with families and households. Regulation 11 provides that only one member of a family can be entitled to a council tax reduction at the same point in time. Regulation 12 ensures that membership of a household is unaffected by temporary absences from it.
Part 3 sets conditions for when a person is entitled to a council tax reduction. These include financial criteria relating to income and capital. Persons who are absent from a dwelling are not entitled in respect of it, unless their absence is temporary (regulation 15). Regulations 16 to 18 describe when a person is to be treated as not being in Great Britain, and is therefore not entitled. Persons subject to immigration control are also not entitled (regulation 19), nor generally are students (regulation 20, though many students have no council tax liability).
Regulation 21 provides that if a person is awarded more council tax reduction than they are entitled to receive, as a result of official error, the resulting arrears of council tax are not to be recovered.
Procedural matters are prescribed by Part 4 of the Regulations. Chapter 1 sets out how applications are to be made, with regulation 24 permitting an application to be treated as made where a person has claimed universal credit and the Secretary of State has provided the administering local authority with information about that claim. Regulation 26 provides for dates on which applications are made and treated as made, with provision for backdating of application dates in some circumstances. Regulation 30 allows electronic submission of documents and, where documents are submitted that way, electronic responses. Chapter 2 of Part 4 describes when an applicant must notify a change of circumstances, with Chapter 3 describing the date on which entitlement begins and the date on which any change in circumstances is to take effect.
Part 5 (regulation 35) sets out the amounts that are to be included in an applicant’s “applicable amount”, which is a sum calculated to represent the needs of the applicant and their family and which is used to work out whether they need a council tax reduction. Schedule 1 makes further provision for these amounts.
Part 6 has provision for the assessment of household income and capital. Chapter 1 provides for the income and capital of persons other than the applicant for a council tax reduction to be treated as the applicant’s. Chapter 2 provides for income to be calculated on a weekly basis, according to whether the applicant or the applicant’s partner have an award of universal credit or not.
Chapter 3 of Part 6 sets out how earned income is calculated, including what is to be treated as employed earnings, with schedule 3 providing for sums that are to be disregarded. Again, different provision is made for where there is a universal credit award, compared with where there is not. Provision is made for cases where earnings are derived from self-employment (see regulations 51 to 54). Chapter 4 sets out how unearned income is to be calculated. Here different provision is made for persons who are students (see regulations 59 to 62). This Chapter also includes assumptions to be made as to income that the applicant’s capital is yielding (regulation 63) and unearned income that the applicant is to be treated as receiving in cases where the applicant has not taken steps to receive it (regulation 65).
Chapter 5 of Part 6, and schedule 4, sets out how capital is to be calculated and valued, with regulation 66 setting out that a person has no entitlement to a council tax reduction if their capital is calculated as exceeding £16,000. Provision is included to deem a person to possess capital where they have deprived themselves of it to become entitled to a council tax reduction, or a greater amount of such a reduction. In these cases regulations 72 and 73 provide for that notional capital to be diminished over time. Chapter 6 provides for some particular cases, while Chapter 7 provides for treatment of childcare charges, the latter varying according to whether or not there is a universal credit award involved.
Part 7 sets out the formula for calculating the maximum amount of council tax reduction to which a person is entitled (see regulation 79(2)). It also provides for extended periods of entitlement in specified circumstances. Part 8 comprises particular rules for specified circumstances, including along with schedule 2 describing entitlement where there is a second adult residing with an applicant for a council tax reduction.
Provision for review of decisions, and further reviews, is made by Part 9. These are undertaken by a panel of persons appointed by the Scottish Ministers.
Part 10 makes consequential, transitional and savings provision, in particular to ensure that persons with existing awards of council tax reduction are deemed to have made applications for a council tax reduction under these Regulations. Schedule 5 makes consequential amendments to other Regulations, with schedule 6 revoking provisions in other Regulations.

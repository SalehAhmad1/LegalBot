With effect from 4.00 a.m. on 22 September 2021, Bangladesh, Egypt, Kenya, the Maldives, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Turkey are removed from that list. Persons arriving in Scotland at or after that time, having departed from or travelled through any of those countries or territories in the preceding 10 days will (unless they are eligible vaccinated arrivals within the meaning of regulation 3 of the International Travel Regulations or a person who is not required to comply with Part 4 or Part 6 of the International Travel Regulations), be required to self-isolate at specified premises in accordance with Part 6 (self-isolation) of the International Travel Regulations, and take a coronavirus test on day 2 and 8 following their arrival in Scotland in accordance with Part 4 (testing following arrival in Scotland) of the International Travel Regulations.
Regulation 4 makes saving provision to the effect that a person arriving in Scotland before these Regulations come into force must comply with the International Travel Regulations as they had effect at the time of the person’s arrival in Scotland. The amendments made by these Regulations apply only in relation to persons arriving in Scotland at or after 4.00 a.m. on 22 September 2021.

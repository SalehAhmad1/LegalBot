(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Milk and Healthy Snack Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2021 (“the Principal Regulations”). These Regulations come into force on 29 July 2021.
These Regulations amends regulation 9(1)(c) of the Principal Regulations to replace, in the determination of payments, the matter of market price of the benefit, with the matter of the relevant local serving rate as set out in the new schedule 3 for the local authority area in which the registered childcare provider provides the benefit.
Regulation 2(2)(b) omits regulation 9(2) of the Principal Regulations so that payments under the scheme are only to be determined by reference to the matters set out in regulation 9(1).
Regulation 3 amends regulation 10(1)(c) of the Principal Regulations to replace the reference to market price with a reference to cost.

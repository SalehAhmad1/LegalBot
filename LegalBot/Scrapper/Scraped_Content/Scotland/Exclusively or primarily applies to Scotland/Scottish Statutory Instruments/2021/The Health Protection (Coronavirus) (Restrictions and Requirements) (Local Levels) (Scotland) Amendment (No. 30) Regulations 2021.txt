The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 1(1) of schedule 19 of the Coronavirus Act 2020(1) (“the Act”) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of coronavirus in Scotland.
The Scottish Ministers consider that the restrictions and requirements imposed by these Regulations are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with paragraph 6(2) and (3) of schedule 19 of the Act, the Scottish Ministers are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make these Regulations without a draft having been laid before, and approved by resolution of, the Scottish Parliament.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions and Requirements) (Local Levels) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the Local Levels Regulations”).
Schedule 7A of the Local Levels Regulations sets out certain restrictions on entering Scotland from, or leaving Scotland to go to, the common travel area. Regulation 3 amends schedule 7A so that, from 30 June 2021, the areas of Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council, Manchester City Council and Salford City Council are omitted from the list of places to which the restrictions in schedule 7A apply, so that the restrictions no longer apply in those areas.

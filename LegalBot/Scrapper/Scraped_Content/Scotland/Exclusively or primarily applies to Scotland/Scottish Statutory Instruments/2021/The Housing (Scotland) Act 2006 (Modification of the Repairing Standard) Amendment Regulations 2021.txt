(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Modification of the Repairing Standard) Regulations 2019 by changing the date on which regulation 3(1)(b) comes into force from 1 February 2021 to 1 February 2022. Regulation 3(1)(b) of those Regulations will have the effect of repealing sections 13(f) and (g) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006.
Section 13 of the 2006 Act sets out the repairing standard duty for private landlords. Subsections (f) and (g) of section 13 relate to fire and carbon monoxide detection and warning equipment. Equivalent requirements are introduced by the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 (Tolerable Standard) (Extension of Criteria) Order 2019 (S.S.I. 2019/8) which amends section 86(1) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 (the tolerable standard). Subsections (f) and (g) are being repealed to remove any parallel provisions and duties.

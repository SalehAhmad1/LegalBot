(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Decision 2000/572/EC which lays down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions for imports of meat preparations from third countries.
Regulation 2 amends Article 4za of Commission Decision 2000/572/EC which modifies the import conditions for imports of meat preparations from countries and territories subject to special transitional import arrangements (EEA states, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Switzerland). It amends Article 4za to provide that the import condition in point 3 of Article 3 of Commission Decision 2000/572/EC, that meat preparations have been deep frozen at the production plant or plants of origin, does not apply until 1 October 2021 where the production plant or plants of origin are in a territory subject to special transitional import arrangements. Regulation 2 also omits an unnecessary provision in Article 4za.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

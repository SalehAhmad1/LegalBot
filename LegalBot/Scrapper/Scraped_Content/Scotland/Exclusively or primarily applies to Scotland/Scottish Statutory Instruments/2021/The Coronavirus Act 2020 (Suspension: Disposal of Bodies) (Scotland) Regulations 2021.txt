(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations suspend the operation of Parts 2 and 3 of schedule 28 (transportation, storage and disposal of dead bodies etc) and, so far as it applies to those Parts, section 58 (powers in relation to transportation, storage and disposal of dead bodies etc) of the Coronavirus Act 2020 (“the Act”) insofar as those provisions apply in Scotland. The suspension means that these provisions no longer have effect in Scotland but are capable of being revived by regulations made under section 88(3) of the Act.

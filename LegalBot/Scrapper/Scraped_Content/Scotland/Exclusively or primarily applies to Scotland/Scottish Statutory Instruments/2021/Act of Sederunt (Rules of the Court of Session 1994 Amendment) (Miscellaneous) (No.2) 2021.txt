(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)
This Act of Sederunt amends the Rules of the Court of Session 1994.
Paragraph 2 inserts a new paragraph (ga) into rule 14.2 of the Rules of the Court of Session 1994 to provide that an application made under an enactment to report a matter to the court due to obstruction or for enforcement is to be made by petition presented in the Outer House. Examples of such applications can be found in paragraph 4(3) of schedule 2 and paragraph 3(1) of schedule 3 of the Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006 (asp 16) and sections 17 and 27 of the Scottish Biometrics Commissioner Act 2020 (asp 8). In consequence of inserting this new general provision in rule 14.2 to deal with such applications, the specific provision made by rule 95.2 is no longer required and is revoked.

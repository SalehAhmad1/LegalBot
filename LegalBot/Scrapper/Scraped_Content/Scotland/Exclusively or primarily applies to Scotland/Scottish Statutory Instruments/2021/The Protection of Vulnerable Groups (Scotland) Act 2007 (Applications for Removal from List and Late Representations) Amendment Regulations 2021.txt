(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 (Applications for Removal from List and Late Representations) Regulations 2010 (“the principal Regulations”).
Regulation 3 of the principal Regulations prescribe the period for the purposes of section 25(3)(a) of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 (“the 2007 Act”) before which an application in accordance with that section for removal from the children’s’ list or adult list is not competent. Different periods are prescribed depending on the age of the applicant.
Regulation 2(2) of these Regulations amends regulation 3 of the principal Regulations to change the age threshold in relation to the prescribed periods after which an individual may make a first application for removal from either the children’s list or the adults’ list (or both lists, in accordance with regulation 5 of the principal Regulations). As a result of the amendment, the period prescribed is now ten years for a person who was aged 26 or over at the date of listing, and five years for a person who was aged 25 years or under at the date of listing.
Regulation 2(3) amends paragraph 1(2) of schedule 1 of the principal Regulations to correct a typographical error.
No business or regulatory impact assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

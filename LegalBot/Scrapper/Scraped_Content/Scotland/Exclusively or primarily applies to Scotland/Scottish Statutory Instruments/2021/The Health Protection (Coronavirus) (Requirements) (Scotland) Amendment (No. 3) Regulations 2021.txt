(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Requirements) (Scotland) Regulations 2021 (“the principal Regulations”).
Regulation 2 inserts new paragraphs (7) to (9) into regulation 7A (requirement to ensure that persons are fully vaccinated, or exempt, when in certain places) of the principal Regulations. Paragraph (7) provides that persons whose organisation has been accredited for entry to the Scottish Event Campus (the Blue Zone) during COP 26 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will be able to access the Glasgow Science Centre (the Green Zone) during the period of the event (31 October to 12 November inclusive). This is because those persons will be deemed to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus for the purposes of regulation 7A(1) of the principal Regulations. Paragraph (8) contains definitions which are relevant for the purposes of paragraph (7). Paragraph (9) provides that paragraphs (7) and (8) cease to have effect on 13 November 2021.

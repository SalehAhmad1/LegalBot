The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 1(1) of schedule 19 of the Coronavirus Act 2020(1) (“the Act”) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of coronavirus in Scotland.

Schedule 7A of the Local Levels Regulations sets out certain restrictions on entering Scotland from, or leaving Scotland to go to, the common travel area. Regulation 3 amends schedule 7A so that, from 21 June 2021, the areas of Manchester City Council and Salford City Council are added to the list of places in respect of which the restrictions set out in schedule 7A apply. It also amends schedule 7A so that, from 18 June 2021, the restrictions no longer apply in respect of the Republic of Ireland and the area of Bedford Borough Council.

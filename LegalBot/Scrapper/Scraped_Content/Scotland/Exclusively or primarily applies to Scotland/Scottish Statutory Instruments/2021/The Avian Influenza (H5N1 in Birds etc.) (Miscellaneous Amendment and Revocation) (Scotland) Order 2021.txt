29th November 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends and revokes legislation concerning certain protection measures in relation to avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in birds, and other measures for the control of avian influenza.
Article 2 amends the Avian Influenza and Influenza of Avian Origin in Mammals (Scotland) Order 2006 which transposed aspects of Council Directive 2005/94 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza. It removes requirements, for licensing the movement of eggs, that the eggs be in disposable packaging.
Article 3 revokes Commission Decision 2006/563/EC concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in wild birds. Commission Decision 2006/563/EC was implemented in Scotland by the Avian Influenza (H5N1 in Wild Birds) (Scotland) Order 2007 (“the Wild Birds Order”).
Article 4 amends the Wild Birds Order. Article 4(3) substitutes article 5(1) of the Wild Birds Order to prescribe the cases in which wild bird control areas and wild bird monitoring areas are to be declared. The cases in which these areas must or may be declared are where the Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) advises Scottish Ministers that a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5 subtype and neuraminidase N1 is present in a wild bird or the carcase of a wild bird in Great Britain and the Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) suspects, or is of the opinion, that the virus is a significant risk to animal and human health. Related amendments are made by article 4(2)(a) and (b) to article 2 (interpretation) of the Wild Birds Order to define highly pathogenic avian influenza and H5N1. Article 4(4) amends article 12 of the Wild Birds Order on the maintenance of areas and the circumstances where these areas must, and must not be, discontinued.
Article 5 amends the Avian Influenza (H5N1 in Poultry) (Scotland) Order 2007 (“the Poultry Order”) which implemented Commission Decision 2006/415/EC concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in poultry. Article 5(2) amends article 6 of the Poultry Order prescribing the cases in which zones are to be established on suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of subtype H5N1 in poultry. Those zones are now to be established where the Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) also suspects that the virus is a significant risk to animal and human health. Article 5(3) amends article 8 of the Poultry Order prescribing the cases in which a restricted zone is to be established on confirmation of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in poultry. A restricted zone must now be established where the Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) also confirms that, in the opinion of Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland), the virus is a significant risk to animal and human health.
Article 6 amends Commission Decision 2010/367/EU, on the implementation of surveillance programmes for avian influenza in poultry and wild birds, consequential on the revocation of Commission Decision 2006/563/EC by article 2. It provides that follow-up measures to be taken in the case of confirmed positive cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in wild birds are the measures in the Wild Birds Order.

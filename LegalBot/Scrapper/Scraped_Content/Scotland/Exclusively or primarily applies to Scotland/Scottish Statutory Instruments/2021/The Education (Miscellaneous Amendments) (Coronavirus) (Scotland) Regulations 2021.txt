20th January 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to regulations that make provision for school placing requests and exclusion appeals and for the procedure of an education appeal committee. These changes are necessary as a result of the coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2)). These Regulations also amend the Nutritional Requirements for Food and Drink in Schools (Scotland) Regulations 2020.
Regulation 2 amends time limits in the Education (Placing in Schools Etc—Deemed Decisions) (Scotland) Regulations 1982 relating to education authorities’ decisions on placing requests made under the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. It also amends time limits relating to the hearing of appeals by education appeal committees against those decisions and decisions on exclusions of pupils.
Regulation 3 amends time limits in the Education (Appeal Committee Procedures) (Scotland) Regulations 1982 relating to the hearing by education appeal committees of references from education authority decisions.
Regulation 4 amends time limits in the Additional Support for Learning (Placing Requests and Deemed Decisions) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 relating to education authorities’ decisions on placing requests made under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004. It also amends time limits relating to the hearing of appeals by education appeal committees against those decisions.
Regulation 5 amends the Nutritional Requirements for Food and Drink in Schools (Scotland) Regulations 2020 to make it clear that certain requirements apply separately to evening meals provided to secondary school pupils in hostels maintained by education authorities.

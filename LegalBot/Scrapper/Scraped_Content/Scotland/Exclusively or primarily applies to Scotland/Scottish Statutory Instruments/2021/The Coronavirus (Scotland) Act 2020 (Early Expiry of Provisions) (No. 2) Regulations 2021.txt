(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations expire the following provisions in schedule 4 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act 2020. The expiry takes effect on 14 June 2021—
Paragraph 18(2) and (4), which together modified the types of case to which the procedure set out in Part IV of the Parole Board (Scotland) Rules 2001 applies. The modifications removed certain types of case from that procedure.
Paragraph 18(5), which modified the procedure in Part IV of the Parole Board (Scotland) Rules 2001 to provide that an oral hearing may be held for a case considered under that procedure if a tribunal of the Parole Board for Scotland considered that such a hearing was in the interests of justice.
Together, the effect of the expiry of these provisions is to remove modifications to the criteria under which a prisoner’s case is to be considered at an oral hearing of a tribunal of the Parole Board for Scotland.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations grant private storage aid for pigmeat under powers conferred by Articles 18 and 20 of Regulation (EU) No. 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products. EUR 2013/1308 is retained EU law, as defined in section 6(7) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16). These Regulations come into force on 8 November 2022.
Regulation 2 provides for the interpretation of terms used in these Regulations.
Regulation 3 provides the Scottish Ministers with the power to make grants for private storage aid. It also provides for the periods for which aid can be granted, the rate at which it will be granted and sets out the minimum tonnage of pigmeat for which aid may be applied.
Regulation 4 provides conditions which a person applying for private storage aid and an application for private storage aid must meet.
Regulation 5 removes the requirement for security to be lodged in respect of private storage aid granted under the scheme established by these Regulations.
Regulation 6 modifies Article 45 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1240 as it applies for the purposes of this scheme, to make clear the circumstances in which the appropriate authority (defined in Article 1A of that Regulation to mean, in relation to Scotland, the Scottish Ministers) may reduce the quantity in an application for private storage aid and the circumstances in which applications for private storage aid are to be rejected.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

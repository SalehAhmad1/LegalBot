(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16). They correct an error in the Storage of Carbon Dioxide (Licensing etc.) (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.S.I. 2021/354) (“the 2021 Regulations”). Regulation 2 amends regulation 8 of the 2021 Regulations.
The 2021 Regulations make amendments to legislation concerning the licensing regime for the geological storage of carbon dioxide. Those amendments address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(d) and (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
No Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared in relation to these Regulations, as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

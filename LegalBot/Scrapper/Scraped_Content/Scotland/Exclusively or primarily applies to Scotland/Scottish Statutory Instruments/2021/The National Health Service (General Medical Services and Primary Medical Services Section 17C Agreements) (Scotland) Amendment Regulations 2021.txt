(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2018 (the “principal GMS regulations”) set out for Scotland the framework for general medical services contracts into which Health Boards may enter under section 17J of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 (the “1978 Act”). Regulations 2 to 10 of these Regulations make amendments to the principal GMS regulations to remove “vaccinations and immunisations” and “childhood vaccinations and immunisations” from the classification of “additional services” such that vaccinations no longer form a core element of the contract which all contractors must provide, unless they have specifically opted out using the process in Schedule 2 of the principal GMS regulations. These Regulations place “vaccinations and immunisations” and “childhood vaccinations and immunisations” in a new classification, “vaccination services” which contractors are only required to provide in certain circumstances. These Regulations make provision as to those circumstances. These Regulations also make consequential and transitional provision in relation to this change of classification.
These Regulations correct one drafting error in the principal GMS regulations in relation to the minimum standards for practice premises which are used by contractors.
The National Health Service (Primary Medical Services Section 17C Agreements) (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (the “principal PMS regulations”) set out for Scotland the framework for primary medical services agreements which Health Boards may make under section 17C of the 1978 Act. Regulations 11 to 20 of these Regulations make amendments to the principal PMS regulations which are equivalent to those amendments made for the principal GMS regulations.

Article 2 of this Order amends the Diseases of Poultry (Scotland) Order 2003 (“the Diseases of Poultry Order”), which, amongst other things, makes provision for the notification procedures and measures to be taken in relation to birds affected or suspected of being affected by disease, and premises where disease exists or has existed.
Article 2(2) of this Order substitutes article 3A (notification procedures to be taken where infection with avian mycoplasmosis or avian chlamydiosis is suspected) of the Diseases of Poultry Order with a new article 3A on the notification of avian mycoplasmosis and a new article 3B on the notification of avian chlamydiosis. The requirement to notify avian mycoplasmosis only applies to domestic fowl and turkeys. The requirement to notify avian chlamydiosis only applies to birds of the order Psittaciformes (parrots and parrot-like birds).
Article 3 of this Order amends the Foot-and-Mouth Disease (Scotland) Order 2006 (“the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Order”), which makes provision for the control of foot-and-mouth disease.
Article 3(2) of this Order amends article 15 of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Order to give Ministers discretion to declare a temporary control zone around suspect premises.

The Scottish Ministers make these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 7(4) and (5)(1) and 14A(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings(2), and Articles 12(1) and 32A(3)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council on novel foods, amending Regulation (EU) No1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1852/2001(3), and all other powers enabling them to do so.
In relation to Parts 2 and 4, the Scottish Ministers have sought the advice of Food Standards Scotland in accordance with Article 7(4) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings.
There has been consultation as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(4).
(1)
Article 2 makes provision as to how the regulation-making power in Article 7(5) is to be exercised.
(2)
EUR 2008/1331, as relevantly amended by S.I. 2019/860. The terms “domestic list”, “authority”, “prescribe” and “appropriate authority” are defined in Article 2. In relation to Part 2 of these Regulations, Articles 7(5) and 14(2)(b) of EUR 2008/1331 are applied by Articles 10(3), 14 and 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives as relevantly amended by S.I. 2019/860.

EUR 2015/2283, as relevantly amended by S.I. 2019/702. The terms “list”, “prescribe” and “appropriate authority” are defined in Article 3. Article 9 makes provision as regards how the regulation-making power in Article 12(1) is to be exercised and Article 27(1) lays down requirements as regards the information to be included in the entry for a novel food on the list set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 where it is authorised based in proprietary scientific evidence or scientific data. In accordance with Article 12(1), the appropriate authority must prescribe updates to that list within seven months of the date of publication of the Food Safety Authority’s opinion.

1.  In the appropriate place, insert the following entry—
“E 960b STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES FROM FERMENTATION (YARROWIA LIPOLYTICA)
Synonyms
Definition
Steviol glycosides from Yarrowia lipolytica consist of a mixture predominantly composed of rebaudioside M, with some rebaudioside D, and smaller amounts of rebaudioside A and rebaudioside B. The manufacturing process comprises two main phases.
The first phase involves fermentation of a non-toxigenic non-pathogenic strain of Yarrowia lipolytica VRM that has been genetically modified with heterologous genes to overexpress steviol glycosides. Removal of biomass by solid-liquid separation and heat treatment is followed by concentration of the steviol glycosides.
The second phase involves purification by employing ion-exchange chromatography, followed by recrystallisation of the steviol glycosides resulting in a final product containing not less than 95% of rebaudiosides M, D, A, and B.
Viable cells or the DNA of Yarrowia lipolytica VRM must not be detected in the food additive.

“E 960C(ii) REBAUDIOSIDE M, AM AND D PRODUCED VIA ENZYMATIC CONVERSION OF HIGHLY PURIFIED STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES FROM STEVIA LEAF EXTRACTS
Synonyms
Definition
Steviol glycosides produced via enzymatic conversion of highly purified steviol glycosides (rebaudioside A or stevioside) from Stevia leaf extracts are composed predominantly of rebaudioside M, rebaudioside D, and rebaudioside AM.
Rebaudiosides D, M and AM are produced via enzymatic conversion of highly purified steviol glycoside (rebaudioside A or stevioside) extracts (95% steviol glycosides) obtained from Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni plant using UDP-glucosyltransferase and sucrose synthase enzymes produced by genetically modified strains of Escherichia coli (pPM294, pFAH170, and pSK041) that facilitate the transfer of glucose from sucrose and UDP-glucose to steviol glycosides via glycosidic bonds. After removal of the enzymes by solid-liquid separation and heat treatment, the purification involves concentration of the steviol glycosides by resin adsorption, followed by recrystallisation of the steviol glycosides resulting in a final product containing not less than 95 % of total steviol glycosides, including one or more of rebaudiosides D, M and AM.

Corrections to existing entries in the Annex (domestic list of novel foods authorised to be placed on the market within Great Britain) to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 concerning the authorisation of bovine milk basic whey protein isolate and xylo-oligosaccharides
1.  In Table 1 (authorised novel foods), for the entry for bovine milk basic whey protein isolate substitute the following entry—
2.  In Table 2 (specifications), for the entry for Xylo-oligosaccharides, in column 2 (description/definition), after the row specifying the moisture (%) content, insert—
“Dry Material (%) - - 70 -75”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision regarding the authorisation of—
food additives under Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (EUR 2008/1331),
food flavourings under EUR 2008/1331, and
novel foods under Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council on novel foods (EUR 2015/2283).
Regulation 3 and schedule 1 amends the list of authorised food additives set out in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives (EUR 2008/1333) to add an entry thereby authorising the placing on the market and use of the food additive steviol glycosides from fermentation (Yarrowia lipolytica) (E 960b). Amendments are made to the list of authorised food additives consequential to that addition, and further amendments correct errors in that Regulation concerning steviol glycosides. Entries are added in that Regulation extending the use of the authorised food additive polyglycerol polyricinoleate (E 476).
Regulation 4 and schedules 2 and 3 amend the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 (EUR 2012/231) laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III of EUR 2008/1333 to—
provide a maximum limit for residues of ethylene oxide applicable to all food additives,
add an entry concerning the authorisation of steviol glycosides from fermentation (Yarrowia lipolytica) (E 960b), and
authorise rebaudioside M, AM and D produced via enzymatic conversion of highly purified steviol glycosides from Stevia leaf extracts (E 960c(ii)), which is a new production method for an existing food additive rebaudioside M produced via enzyme modification of steviol glycosides from Stevia E 960c(i) (formerly E 960c).
Regulation 5 and schedules 4 to 8 amend the list of authorised novel foods set out in the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 (EUR 2017/2470). Schedule 8 corrects errors to existing entries in the list concerning bovine milk basic whey protein isolate and xylo-oligosaccharides. Schedules 4 to 7 authorise the placing on the market of 4 new novel foods—
partially hydrolysed protein from spent barley (Hordeum vulgare) and rice (Oryza sativa),
cetylated fatty acids,
3-fucosyllactose (3-FL) (produced by a derivative strain of Escherichia coli K-12 DH1), and
lacto-N-fucopentaose I (LNFP-I) and 2’-fucosyllactose (2’-FL) mixture.
Regulation 6 removes 22 flavouring substances from the domestic list of authorised flavouring substances in Annex 1 to Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods (EUR 2008/1334).
Regulation 7 is a transitional measure allowing the 22 flavouring substances, the authorisation of which is removed by regulation 6, and foods containing them to be placed on the market, and be added to other foods, if already present in the United Kingdom or in transit to Great Britain before the removal of the authorisations. Foods to which such substances are added may be placed on the market, and used, until their date of minimum durability (‘best before’ date) or ‘use by’ date.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

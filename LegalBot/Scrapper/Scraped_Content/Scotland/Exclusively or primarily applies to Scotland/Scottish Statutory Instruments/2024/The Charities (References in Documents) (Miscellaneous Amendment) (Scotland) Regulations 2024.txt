(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisations Regulations 2011 (“the 2011 Regulations”) and the Charities References in Documents (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (“the 2007 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the 2011 Regulations to require Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisations (“SCIOs”) to include their Scottish charity number and any working name on documents listed in regulation 9 of the 2011 Regulations and issued or signed by, or on behalf of, the SCIO on or after these Regulations come into force on 1 June 2024. This is in addition to stating their name and the fact that they are a SCIO, which are already requirements under section 52(1) to (3) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 (“the 2005 Act”). Charities other than SCIOs are already subject to similar requirements in terms of regulation 2 of the 2007 Regulations.
Regulation 3 makes an amendment to the 2007 Regulations as a consequence of changes made to the 2005 Act by paragraph 6 of the schedule of the Charities (Regulation and Administration) (Scotland) Act 2023 in relation to working names.

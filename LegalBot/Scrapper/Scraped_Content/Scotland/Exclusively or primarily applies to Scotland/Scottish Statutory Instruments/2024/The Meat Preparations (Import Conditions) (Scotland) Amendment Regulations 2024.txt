(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Decision 2000/572/EC which lays down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions for imports of meat preparations from third countries.
Regulation 2 amends Commission Decision 2000/572/EC to remove the import condition that meat preparations from third countries have been deep-frozen at the production plant or plants of origin.
Regulation 3 revokes, in consequence, other instruments or the provisions of other instruments which modified that import condition.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order adds Community Justice Scotland and the Patient Safety Commissioner for Scotland to the list of Scottish public authorities in Part 3 of schedule 19 of the Equality Act 2010 (“the Act”). The public authorities listed in schedule 19 are subject to the public sector equality duty in section 149 of the Act.
The public sector equality duty is a duty to have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Act, to advance equality of opportunity and to foster good relations between persons who share a relevant protected characteristic and persons who do not share that protected characteristic.
This Order also removes community justice authorities and the chief officer of a community justice authority from the list of Scottish public authorities in Part 3 of schedule 19 of the Act. All community justice authorities were dissolved on 31 March 2017 by section 36(1) of the Community Justice (Scotland) Act 2016.

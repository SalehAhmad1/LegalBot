(3)
The sampling and the analyses shall be performed in accordance with the sampling procedures and the analytical reference methods set out in point 1(b) of Annex III of these Regulations.
(4)
The analytical report referred to in Article 10(3) of this Regulation must be issued by a laboratory accredited for the analysis of PCP in food and feed in accordance with BS EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 “General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories” (published by the British Standards Institution on 30 June 2018 (ISBN 978 0 539 01414 3), and available from the British Standards Institution at https://knowledge.bsigroup.com). The analytical report must indicate: (a) the results of sampling and analysis for the presence of PCP, performed by the competent authorities of the country of origin or of the country where the consignment is consigned from if that country is different from the country of origin; (b) the measurement uncertainty of the analytical result; (c) the limit of detection (LOD) of the analytical method; (d) the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the analytical method. The extraction before analysis must be performed with an acidified solvent. The analysis must be carried out according to the modified version of the QuEChERS method or according to an equally reliable method. The modified version of the QuEChERS method is set out in the document “Analytical Quality Control and Method Validation Procedures for Pesticide Residues Analysis in Food and Feed” (SANTE 2017/11813), implemented on 1 January 2020 and available at https://www.eurl-pesticides.eu/userfiles/file/EurlALL/AqcGuidance_SANTE_2019_12682.pdf.

(6)
Residues of Carbofuran.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1793 on the temporary increase of official controls and emergency measures governing the entry into the Union of certain goods from certain third countries.
Regulation 2(2) and (3) inserts provision into Regulation (EU) 2019/1793 concerning the sampling and analyses of food and feed of non-animal origin for the hazard Listeria. Regulation 2(6) and schedule 3 make related provision through the addition of Annex IIIa of Regulation (EU) 2019/1793 which outlines the sampling procedure and analytical reference method for the control of the presence of Listeria in food.
Regulation 2(4) provides that Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2019/1793 is substituted, with amendments, with the Annex in schedule 1 which contains a list which sets out food and feed of non-animal origin from certain third countries which is subject to a temporary increase of official controls at border controls posts and control points in Great Britain.
Regulation 2(5) provides that Annex II of Regulation (EU) 2019/1793 is substituted, with amendments, with the Annex in schedule 2. The Annex in schedule 2 comprises two tables. Table 1 contains the list of food and feed from certain third countries subject to special conditions for entry into Great Britain due to contamination risk by mycotoxins, including aflatoxins, pesticide residues, pentachlorophenol and dioxins and microbiological contamination. Table 2 contains the list of compound food containing any of the food listed in Table 1 of Annex 2 due to the risk of contamination by aflatoxins in a quantity above 20% of either a single product or as the sum of those products.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact, on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen. A Policy Note has been published alongside this instrument at www.legislation.gov.uk.

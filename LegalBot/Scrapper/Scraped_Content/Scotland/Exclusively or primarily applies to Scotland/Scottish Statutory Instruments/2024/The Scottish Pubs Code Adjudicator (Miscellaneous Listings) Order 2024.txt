(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 (“the FOI Act”), the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (“the Public Services Reform Act”) and the Public Records (Scotland) Act 2011 (“the Public Records Act”) to add the Scottish Pubs Code Adjudicator (“the Adjudicator”) to the lists of public authorities subject to those Acts.
Article 2 adds the Adjudicator to the authorities listed in schedule 1 of the FOI Act, which makes the Adjudicator subject to the freedom of information requirements set out in that Act.
Article 3 adds the Adjudicator to the public bodies listed in schedule 5 of the Public Services Reform Act, which means the Scottish Ministers may by order make provision under Part 2 of that Act to improve efficiency, effectiveness and economy in the Adjudicator’s exercise of public functions.
Article 4 adds the Adjudicator to the authorities listed in the schedule of the Public Records Act, which puts the Adjudicator under a duty to comply with the records management requirements in Part 1 of that Act.

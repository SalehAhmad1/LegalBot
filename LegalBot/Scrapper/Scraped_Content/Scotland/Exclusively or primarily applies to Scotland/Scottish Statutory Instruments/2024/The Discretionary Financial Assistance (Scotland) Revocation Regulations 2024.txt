2000 c. 19 (“the 2000 Act”). Section 69(7) is an interpretation provision and contains a definition of “prescribed”. The function of making regulations to prescribe the circumstances in which a person may receive financial assistance to meet or help meet housing costs, for the purpose of payments under section 88 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (asp 9) (“the 2018 Act”), transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46) (“the 1998 Act”) as read with sections 25 and 32 of the Scotland Act 2016 (c. 11) (“the 2016 Act”). Section 25 of the 2016 Act inserted exceptions into the social security reservation in Head F1 of Part 2 of schedule 5 of the 1998 Act relating to financial assistance to a person who is entitled to housing benefit or any other reserved benefit payable in respect of a liability to make rent payments. Section 32 provides the meaning of “pre-commencement enactment” in this context. Sections 25 and 32 were commenced on 1 April and 5 September, respectively, 2017 by S.I. 2016/759. Accordingly, in so far as the functions under section 69 of the 2000 Act are exercisable within devolved competence, they are now exercisable by the Scottish Ministers instead of by the Secretary of State.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Discretionary Financial Assistance Regulations 2001 (“the 2001 Regulations”), as they apply in Scotland. These Regulations do not affect the operation of the 2001 Regulations in England and Wales. The 2001 Regulations provide relevant authorities with a power to make discretionary housing payments by way of financial assistance and regulate the amount, manner, and procedure of this assistance.
Regulation 2 revokes the 2001 Regulations with effect from 1 April 2024. Relevant authorities will make discretionary housing payments in Scotland on and after 1 April 2024 by virtue of Part 5 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018, which is to be commenced on that date by the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (Commencement No. 10 and Transitional Provision) Regulations 2024.

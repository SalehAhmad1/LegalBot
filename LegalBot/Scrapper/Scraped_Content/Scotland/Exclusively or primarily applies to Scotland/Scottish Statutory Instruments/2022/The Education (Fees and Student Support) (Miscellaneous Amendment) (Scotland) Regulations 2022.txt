(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (“the Fees Regulations”) and the Student Support (Scotland) Regulations 2022 (“the Student Support Regulations”).
These Regulations amend the eligibility categories in schedule 1 of both the Fees Regulations and the Student Support Regulations to insert new eligibility categories for United Kingdom nationals who were evacuated from Afghanistan under Operation Pitting and United Kingdom nationals who fled Ukraine following the Russian invasion in February 2022.
Amendments to both the Fees Regulations and the Student Support Regulations are also made to remove unnecessary drafting following EU Exit and to clarify the home fee status of EU nationals and their family members who have been living in the United Kingdom for less than 3 years.

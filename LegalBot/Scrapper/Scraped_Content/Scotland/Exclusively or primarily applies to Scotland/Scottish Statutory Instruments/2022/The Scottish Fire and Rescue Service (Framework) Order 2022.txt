(This note is not part of the Order)
The Scottish Ministers are required to prepare a framework document under section 40(1) of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 (“the Act”) (as amended by the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012, which established a single Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (“SFRS”) to replace the fire and rescue authorities and joint fire and rescue boards). The Scottish Ministers are required by section 40(2) of the Act to keep the framework document under review.
The Fire and Rescue Framework for Scotland 2022 (“the 2022 Framework document”) sets out priorities and objectives for SFRS in connection with the carrying out of its statutory functions. It also contains such guidance, and other matters relating to SFRS and its functions, as the Scottish Ministers consider appropriate. Section 41(1) of the Act requires SFRS to have regard to the 2022 Framework document in carrying out its functions. The 2022 Framework document was published in March 2022 and is available on the Scottish Government’s website: http://www.gov.scot/ISBN/9781804351024.
Article 2 of this Order gives effect to the framework document entitled “Fire and Rescue Framework for Scotland 2022”, for the purpose of section 40(4) of the Act. The 2022 Framework document replaces the Fire and Rescue Framework for Scotland 2016 which was brought into force by The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (Framework) Order 2016.
Article 3 of this Order revokes the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (Framework) Order 2016.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment, an Equality Impact Assessment, a Child Rights and Wellbeing Assessment and a Fairer Scotland Duty Assessment have been prepared in support of the Framework. Copies may be obtained online at www.gov.scot.

This Order modifies section 83(6) of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 (“the Act”) under powers provided in sections 83(7) and 141(2) of the Act to restrict the application of the landlord register in certain specified circumstances.
Section 83(6) lists circumstances where the use of a house as a dwelling is to be disregarded for the purposes of landlord registration. This Order adds a further set of circumstances where the use of a house as a dwelling is to be disregarded for the purposes of landlord registration.
Article 2 of the Order modifies section 83(6) to provide that the use of a house under an occupancy arrangement (not a lease) by a person who has permission to enter or stay in the United Kingdom granted under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme route in the immigration rules, does not constitute the use of a dwelling for the purposes of landlord registration.

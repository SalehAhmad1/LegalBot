SCHEDULE
Diagram for insertion into Part 26 of schedule 12 of the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the instrument)
This instrument amends the Traffic Signs Regulations 2016 and the Traffic Signs Directions 2016, together cited as the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”).
Regulation 4 makes a minor amendment to schedule 2 of the 2016 Regulations by adding “Concealed access” and “Pedestrians and cyclists crossing” to the list of legends which may be used on plates associated with signs that warn of hazards and signs for bridges and other structures.
Regulation 5 amends schedule 8 of the 2016 Regulations by adding alternative versions of the signs indicating the entrance to, and the end of, a pedestrian, or pedestrian and cycle, zone. The alternative versions incorporate flashing lights instead of a time period in the upper panel.
Regulation 5 also inserts two new Parts into schedule 8 of the 2016 Regulations. New Part 4A sets out provisions applying to signs in Part 4B. New Part 4B prescribes signs indicating the existence of a low emission zone, the use of cameras to identify contraventions of a low emission zone scheme, the end of a low emission zone, and road markings indicating the commencement of a low emission zone.
Regulation 6 amends schedule 11 of the 2016 Regulations.
Regulation 6(1)(a) provides for a new sign intended to be used on primary routes to indicate the distance in hundreds of yards to the point that a reduced maximum speed limit begins. This sign can only be used where the maximum speed limit is being reduced by at least 20 mph. Regulation 6(3)(b) and (c) makes provision to enable an alternative version of the sign to be used on non-primary routes.
Regulation 6(2)(b) amends the variants which are permitted to be made to the sign which indicates the distance to a parking place ahead. The amendment allows for the distance to be varied, and for a second distance to be added to the sign.
Regulation 7 amends schedule 12 of the 2016 Regulations.
Regulation 7(2) provides for a new sign which is intended to indicate the existence of a service point for motor homes.
Regulation 7(3) provides for a new sign indicating property managed by Forestry and Land Scotland, and for a new sign indicating a nature reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds Scotland.
Regulation 7(4) provides for a new sign indicating the existence of a low emission zone.
Regulation 7(5) provides for the new sign for service points for motor homes to be added to the symbols that may be placed on a services sign.
Regulation 7(6) makes minor amendments to the sign which indicates a junction ahead leading to a small town or village which provides services. The amendment reduces the number and variety of services which are required to be offered before the sign can be used. Regulation 7(6)(b) and the schedule of these Regulations provides for a substitute diagram for this sign to be inserted into the 2016 Regulations. This will allow for the depiction on the sign of the availability of electric car charging points and service points for motor homes, in addition to those services which currently feature on the sign.
Regulation 8 makes saving provision to enable signs which are currently in place to continue to operate despite the amendments made by these Regulations.
Part 2, direction 2 provides that the low emission zone sign at item 1 in Schedule 8, Part 4B must only be placed to indicate the effect of an Act, order, regulation, bylaw, resolution or notice which restricts or prohibits the use of the road by traffic, and must be placed as near as practicable to the point the restriction or prohibition begins or ends.

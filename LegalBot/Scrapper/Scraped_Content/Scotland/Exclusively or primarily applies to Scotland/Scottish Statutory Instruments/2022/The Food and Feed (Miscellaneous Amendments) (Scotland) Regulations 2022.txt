The maximum level established for premixtures takes into account the additives with the highest level of lead and cadmium and not the sensitivity of the different animal species to lead and cadmium. As provided in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on additives for use in animal nutrition, in order to protect animal and public health(2), it is the responsibility of the producer of premixtures to ensure that, in addition to compliance with the maximum levels for premixtures, the instructions for use of the premixture are in accordance with the maximum levels for complementary and complete feed.

Maximum levels refer to an analytical determination of fluorine, whereby extraction is performed with hydrochloric acid 1 N for 20 minutes at ambient temperature. Equivalent extraction procedures can be applied for which it can be demonstrated that the used extraction procedure has an equal extraction efficiency.
(6)
For the determination of lead in kaolinitic clay and in feed containing kaolinitic clay, the maximum level refers to an analytical determination of lead, whereby extraction is performed in nitric acid (5% w/w) for 30 minutes at boiling temperature. Equivalent extraction procedures can be applied for which it can be demonstrated that the used extraction procedure has an equal extraction efficiency.
(7)
Forage includes products intended for animal feed such as hay, silage, fresh grass, etc.

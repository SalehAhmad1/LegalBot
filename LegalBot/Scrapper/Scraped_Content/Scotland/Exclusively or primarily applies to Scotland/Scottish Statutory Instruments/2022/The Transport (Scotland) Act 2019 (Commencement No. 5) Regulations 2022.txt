(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring section 34 and paragraphs 3(1) and (6)(a)(v)(A) and 4(1) and (2)(a) of the schedule of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2019 (“the 2019 Act”) into force on 24 June 2022.
Section 34 of the 2019 Act amends the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 to confer a power on local transport authorities to provide services for the carriage of passengers by road using vehicles that require a PSV operator’s licence to do so. Local transport authorities are able to exercise that power provided they are satisfied that providing such services will contribute to the implementation of their relevant general policies. Paragraph 3(1) and (6)(a)(v)(A) of the schedule of the 2019 Act amends the definition of “relevant general policies” in section 48 of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 for this purpose. Paragraph 4(1) and (2)(a) of the schedule of the 2019 Act amends section 10 of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2005 to permit the Scottish Ministers to transfer the function of providing services for the carriage of passengers by road using vehicles that require a PSV operator’s licence to do so to Regional Transport Partnerships.
The Bill for the 2019 Act received Royal Assent on 15 November 2019. Sections 128 to 131 came into force the following day.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT REGULATIONS

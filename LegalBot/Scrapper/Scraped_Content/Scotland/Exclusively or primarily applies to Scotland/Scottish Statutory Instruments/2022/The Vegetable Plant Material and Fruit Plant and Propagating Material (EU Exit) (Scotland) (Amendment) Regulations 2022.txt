8th June 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made by the Scottish Ministers in exercise of powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) and 1(3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies.
They do so by making amendments to the Marketing of Vegetable Plant Material Regulations 1995 and the Marketing of Fruit Plant and Propagating Material (Scotland) Regulations 2017 (together the “Vegetable Plant and Fruit Plant Material Regulations”) to remove the time limit which currently applies to the Scottish Ministers’ ability to recognise fruit and vegetable propagating material originating from outside the UK as being of equivalent standard to that produced domestically under the Vegetable Plant and Fruit Plant Material Regulations.
A business and regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared in relation to these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact upon businesses, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

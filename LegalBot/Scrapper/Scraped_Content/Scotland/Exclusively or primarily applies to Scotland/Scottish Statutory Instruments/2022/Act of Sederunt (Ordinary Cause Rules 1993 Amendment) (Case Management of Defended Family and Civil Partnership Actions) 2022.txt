SCHEDULEEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)
This Act of Sederunt amends the Ordinary Cause Rules 1993 (“OCR”) to make provision about the procedure to be followed in defended family and civil partnership actions in the sheriff court.
Paragraph 2(3) removes family and civil partnership actions from the Standard Procedure in Defended Causes in Chapter 9 of the OCR. New rules 33.36A-33.36Q and 33A.36A-33A.36Q insert a bespoke procedure which provides for enhanced judicial case management in family and civil partnership actions in the sheriff court.
New rules 33.36J and 33.36P, and 33A.36J and 33A.36P provide that an Initial Case Management Hearing and a Full Case Management Hearing must take place in all defended family and civil partnership actions within a specified period. The period specified is dependent on whether or not an action involves a crave for an order under section 11 of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 (c. 36). In both the Initial and Full Case Management Hearing, the sheriff must seek to secure the expeditious progress of the cause. An Initial Case Management Hearing and a Child Welfare Hearing may be heard at the same time, if appropriate.
Paragraph 2(25) revokes the previous case management rules relating to certain family actions in Chapter 33AA of the OCR. The provisions relating to fixing a date for a case management hearing and holding a pre-hearing conference under Chapter 33AA are reflected in new rules 33.36A and 33.36L, and 33A.36A and 33A.36L.
New rules 33.36H and 33A.36H provide that an action may be sisted until a specified date and a review of sist hearing must take place not later than 30 days following the expiration of the sist.
New rules 33.36O and 33A.36O require parties to exchange a list of witnesses no later than 7 days before the Full Case Management Hearing and include on the list a summary of the matters on which each witness is expected to speak.
New rules 33.36Q and 33A.36Q require, where possible, sheriffs to preside over all hearings in a case to provide continuity for litigants.
The schedule contains new forms G5A and G6B for use in the new procedure.

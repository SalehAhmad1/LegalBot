(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Police Pension Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 2015 (No. 142) (“the 2015 Regulations”) in consequence of provision made by the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7). The amendments ensure that the existing pension schemes established by the Police Pensions Regulations 1987 (No. 257) and the Police Pensions (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (No. 201) will, except for limited purposes, be closed to the accrual of pension benefits on and after 1 April 2022 and that any members treated as being in pensionable service under the existing pension schemes will, on that date, begin accruing benefits in the scheme established by the 2015 Regulations.

(This note does not form part of the Regulations)
The Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014 created a new structure for tribunals dealing with devolved matters under the judicial leadership of the Lord President of the Court of Session as head of the Scottish Tribunals.
It provided for a First-tier Tribunal and an Upper Tribunal and for the First-tier Tribunal to be divided into chambers dependent on the subject-matter of the case before it and similarly for the Upper Tribunal to be divided into divisions. The First-tier Tribunal has been divided into chambers, one of which is the Local Taxation Chamber.
Paragraph 4 of schedule 9 of the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014 enables the Scottish Ministers, by regulations, to make Tribunal Rules until such time as the provisions of the 2014 Act conferring responsibility on the Scottish Civil Justice Council and the Court of Session for the making of Tribunal Rules are commenced.
These Regulations provide for the rules of procedure which are to apply in the Local Taxation Chamber when hearing appeals under the Valuation Acts, council tax appeals, appeals against a determination of an application for council tax reduction, and penalty notice appeals under the Non-Domestic Rates Act 2020 Act. The rules of procedure are set out in the schedule of the Regulations.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared for these Regulations and placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Copies can be obtained from the Scottish Government Justice Directorate, St Andrew’s House, Edinburgh EH1 3DG, and online at www.legislation.gov.uk.

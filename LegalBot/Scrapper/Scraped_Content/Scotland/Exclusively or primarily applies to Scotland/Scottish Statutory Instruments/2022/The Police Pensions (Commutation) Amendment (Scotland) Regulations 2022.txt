(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Police Pension Regulations 1987 to remove the restriction on commutation of pension for officers who retire with an ordinary pension after less than 30 years’ pensionable service and are below voluntary retirement age. They also remove the end date on the underpin which exists to allow Scottish officers to use actuarial factors calculated by the Scheme Actuary in England & Wales, if they are higher.

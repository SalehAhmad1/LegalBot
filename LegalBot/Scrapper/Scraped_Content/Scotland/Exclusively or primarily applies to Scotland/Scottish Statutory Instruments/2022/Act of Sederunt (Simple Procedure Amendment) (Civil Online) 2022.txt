2nd March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)
This Act of Sederunt amends the Act of Sederunt (Simple Procedure) 2016 so as to require all simple procedure claims to be submitted using Civil Online or the internet interface to the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service’s case management system. It makes permanent the temporary modifications introduced by Act of Sederunt (Simple Procedure Amendment) (Civil Online) 2020, which were extended for a further period by Act of Sederunt (Simple Procedure Amendment) (Civil Online) 2021. It revokes both of those Acts of Sederunt in consequence of the temporary modifications being converted into amendments by this Act of Sederunt.
Claims may still be sent using one of the other methods mentioned in rule 6.6 of the Simple Procedure Rules but when doing so claimants will require to provide a note, to accompany the Claim Form, explaining why it could not have been sent using either the portal on the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service website or the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service’s internet interface to its case management system. The sheriff will only permit the claim to be registered if the sheriff considers, from the explanation given in the note, that the claimant could not have sent it using either the portal or the interface.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 suspends the operation of those parts of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of schedule 1 of the Coronavirus (Scotland) (No. 2) Act 2020 (the “Act”) which have not already expired.
Paragraph 1 of schedule 1 defines a student residential tenancy as one which meets the conditions in paragraph 5(1) of schedule 1 of the Private Housing (Tenancies) (Scotland) Act 2016.
Paragraph 2 enables a person with a student residential tenancy to terminate the accommodation agreement with their landlord where certain requirements are met.
Paragraph 3 sets out the requirements that a notice to terminate a student residential tenancy requires to meet and the minimum notice period that applies. For a notice to be valid it must be in writing and it must state the day on which the tenancy is to end, which must be a day that is after the last day of the minimum notice period. The minimum notice period that applies is 28 days.
The suspension means that these provisions no longer have effect but are capable of being revived by regulations made under section 8 of the Act.
Regulation 3 makes saving provision.

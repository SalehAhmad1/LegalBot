(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Vocational Training for General Dental Practice) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 (“the principal Regulations”) which make provision for vocational training for dentists.
Regulations 2 to 5 amend the principal Regulations. Regulations 2 and 3(a), (b) and (c)(ii) make provision for the employer of those undergoing vocational training to be NHS Education for Scotland instead of a dentist who is an approved trainer or a Health Board. Regulation 3(d) removes an outdated reference to the post of Director of Postgraduate General Dental Practice Education. Regulation 4 amends an exemption from completing vocational training in regulation 2(3)(a) of the principal Regulations so that the exemption applies to those dentists holding a relevant European diploma. Regulation 5 omits regulation 8 of the principal Regulations which is now spent, and regulations 3(c)(i), d(i) and (e) make amendments consequential on that omission.
Regulation 6 makes a corresponding amendment to the National Health Service (General Dental Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2010 to reflect the change of employer to NHS Education for Scotland.
Regulation 7 is a saving provision. It saves the existing law for one year for dentists who are undergoing vocational training but have not completed that training when these Regulations come into force.

The Scottish Ministers make the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 
2(1) and (2), 4(1) and 14(1)(b) and (4) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984(a) and all other 
powers enabling them to do so. 
In accordance with section 14(1)(b) of that Act, they are satisfied that the traffic on the length of 
road specified in the schedule should be restricted or prohibited because of the likelihood of 
danger to the public, or of serious damage to the road, which is not attributable to works. 
In accordance with section 14(3) of that Act, they have had regard to the existence of alternative 
routes suitable for the traffic which will be affected by this Order.

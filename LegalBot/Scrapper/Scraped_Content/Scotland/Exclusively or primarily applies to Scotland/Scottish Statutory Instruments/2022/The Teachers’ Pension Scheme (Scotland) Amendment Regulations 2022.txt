16th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Teachers’ Pension Scheme (Scotland) (No. 2) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”) in consequence of provision made by the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7).
Paragraphs 1 to 3 ensure that the existing pension scheme established by the Teachers’ Superannuation (Scotland) Regulations 2005 will, except for limited purposes, be closed to the accrual of pension benefits with effect from 1st April 2022. Any members in pensionable service under the existing pension scheme will, on that date, begin accruing benefits in the scheme established by the 2014 Regulations.
Paragraph 4 provides that transfer values accepted for previously unprotected (or tapered) members can be allocated into the legacy scheme in the same way as paragraph 17 provides for protected members.
Paragraph 5 provides that only elections made prior to 1 April 2022 will be considered in respect of the existing scheme rules (as defined in the 2014 Regulations).

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Firemen’s Pension Scheme Order 1992 to remove the restriction on commutation of pension for members who retire with an ordinary pension after fewer than 30 years’ pensionable service and who are below voluntary retirement age. It also removes the end date on the underpin which exists to allow Scottish members to use actuarial factors calculated by the Scheme Actuary in England, if they are higher.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Sports Grounds and Sporting Events (Designation) (Scotland) Order 2014 (“the 2014 Order”). The 2014 Order designates sports grounds, classes of sporting events played at those grounds and classes of sporting events outside Great Britain for the purposes of Part II of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 (sporting events: control of alcohol etc.).
Article 2(2) of this Order makes changes to the list of sports grounds designated in the 2014 Order to reflect changes to the names of several of the previously designated grounds. Further, it removes some of the previously designated grounds, and adds additional grounds, to reflect changes to the membership of the football leagues for which the home grounds of member clubs were designated in the 2014 Order.
Article 2(3) of this Order adds association football matches in the competition for the UEFA Europa Conference League to the list of classes of sporting events designated in the 2014 Order.

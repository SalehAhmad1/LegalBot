(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Nutritional Requirements for Food and Drink in Schools (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (“the 2020 Regulations”).
The 2020 Regulations specify the nutritional requirements that education authorities and managers of grant aided schools must comply with in relation to the provision of food and drink in schools. Regulation 2(a) amends regulation 2 of the 2020 Regulations to omit paragraphs (3) and (4). Those paragraphs provide that where, in the event of shortages in the supply of food, an education authority is, or the managers of a grant aided school are, unable to provide food or drink to pupils which complies with the requirements, they may provide food or drink that does not so comply. Regulation 2(b) of these Regulations substitutes a new paragraph 5 of schedule 3 of the 2020 Regulations which provides a formula for calculating the energy and nutrient content of the average school meal on a weekly basis.

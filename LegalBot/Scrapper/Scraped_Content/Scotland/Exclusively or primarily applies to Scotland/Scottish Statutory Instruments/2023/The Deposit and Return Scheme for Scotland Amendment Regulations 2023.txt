(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Deposit and Return Scheme for Scotland Regulations 2020 (“the 2020 Regulations”) which make provision for the operation of a deposit and return scheme. These Regulations come into force on the day after the day on which they are made.
Regulation 2 defines the 2020 Regulations for the purposes of these Regulations.
Regulation 4 amends the date in regulation 1(5) of the 2020 Regulations (the date on which parts 2, 7 and 8, and certain provisions in Part 5, of the 2020 Regulations come into force).
Regulation 5 inserts a definition of a large retailer, a listed producer and a low volume drink product into regulation 2(1) of the 2020 Regulations and amends the definition of producer. Regulation 6 amends the definition of scheme article in the 2020 Regulations.
Regulation 7 inserts a new regulation 3A into the 2020 Regulations which prohibits the marketing or sale (including through online retail or vending machine sales to a consumer in Scotland) of a low volume drink product, unless the producer is listed or registered with SEPA. The seller must also inform the purchaser that the product is not a scheme article.
Regulation 8 amends regulation 5 of the 2020 Regulations so that the obligations there take effect from 1 March 2024. Regulation 9 amends the dates by which a producer must apply for registration under regulation 7 of the 2020 Regulations. Regulation 10 amends the dates from which a registration takes effect under regulation 8 of the 2020 Regulations. Regulation 11 is a consequential change to amend the reference to the registration date.

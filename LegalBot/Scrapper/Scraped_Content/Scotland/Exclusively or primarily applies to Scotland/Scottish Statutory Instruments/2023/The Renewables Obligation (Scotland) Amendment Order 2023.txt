(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2009 (“the 2009 Order”). The 2009 Order has a mechanism known as mutualisation which provides for recovery by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority of payments from suppliers if there is a payment default and the level of default is equal to or in excess of a threshold. This Order provides that the mutualisation threshold is updated each year and linked to the annual cost of the scheme to suppliers.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for this Order as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

31st May 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Act of Sederunt)
This Act of Sederunt inserts new Chapters into the Rules of the Court of Session 1994 and the Ordinary Cause Rules 1993 to provide that hearings at which certain types of procedural business are to be heard are to be attended by electronic means.
Provision is made so that the court, or sheriff, may at its own instance or on the motion of a party on cause shown order that attendance at such hearings by any person is to be by means of physical attendance instead.
Provision is also made so that the court, or sheriff, may at its own instance or on the motion of a party on cause shown order that attendance at other kinds of hearings by any person, which are otherwise attended physically, may instead be attended by electronic means.
Provision for hybrid modes of attendance is also included so that a person may attend a hearing partly by physical means and partly by electronic means, or so that one person may attend by one means while another attends by the other means. This is not an exclusive provision and is intended to provide maximum flexibility for the court or sheriff and those participating in hearings.
Consequential amendments are made to revoke court rules in relation to live links as those rules are superseded by the amendments made by this Act of Sederunt. Saving provision is made in respect of live link motions which are enrolled before the coming into force of this Act of Sederunt but which have not been determined at that point.

23rd May 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made to correct minor errors in the Packaging Waste (Data Reporting) (Scotland) Regulations 2023 (S.S.I. 2023/7) (“the first Regulations”), to make further provision clarifying when a brand owner is a producer in relation to packaging, and to assign responsibility for certain packaging to packer/fillers, rather than brand owners, and to importers.
A partial Business Regulatory Impact Assessment of the effect that the first Regulations will have on business has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.

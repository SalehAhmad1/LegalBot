(c)
where for the purpose of head (b)(ii)(aa) of this definition, an individual’s recognisable cycle of work at a school, other education establishment or other place of employment is one year and includes periods of school holidays or similar vacations during which they do not work, those periods and any other periods not forming part of such holidays or vacations during which they are not required to work is disregarded in establishing the average hours for which they are engaged in work,
(d)
for the purposes of heads (a) and (b) of this definition, in determining the number of hours for which an individual is engaged in work, that number includes any time allowed to that individual by their employer for a meal or for refreshment, but only where that individual is, or expects to be, paid earnings in respect of that time,

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for Carer Support Payment which is a type of carer’s assistance given by the Scottish Ministers under section 28 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018.
Part 2 provides an overview of arrangements for payment of Carer Support Payment.
Part 3 sets out the eligibility criteria including the age criteria, requirements for the provision of care to a cared for person, residence and presence conditions, the effect of entitlement to other benefits, criteria for individuals in education and the earnings limit. Schedule 2 provides for calculation of earnings.
Part 4 provides for the making of applications, the time of payments, the amount and form of Carer Support Payment and abatement in respect of a relevant benefit. It also provides for continuing eligibility, temporary stops in entitlement and multiple applications involving the same cared for person. It includes provisions to make payments by way of deduction and when increases and decreases in payments take effect.
Part 5 provides for suspensions.
Part 6 deals with reconsideration of entitlement, where an award of Carer Support Payment has already been made and is being revisited.

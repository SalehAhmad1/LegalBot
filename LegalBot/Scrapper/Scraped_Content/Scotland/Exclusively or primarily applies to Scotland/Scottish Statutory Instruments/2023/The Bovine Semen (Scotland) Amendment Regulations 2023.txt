6th December 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Bovine Semen (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (“the Principal Regulations”), which control the collection, processing and storage of bovine semen.
Regulations 4 and 7 (which respectively amend regulations 10 and 21 of the Principal Regulations) remove the requirement for teaser animals to be approved for use at unlicensed premises.
Regulations 5, 6, 8, 14(c), 15(c) and 16 (which respectively amend regulations 14, 16, 24, paragraph 2 of Part 3 of schedule 3, paragraph 2 of Part 3 of schedule 5 and schedule 7 of the Principal Regulations) allow the processing of bovine semen at unlicensed processing premises, make related provision controlling the movement and processing of bovine semen (including a requirement that processing at unlicensed processing premises be supervised by a centre veterinarian of a licensed collection centre or a veterinarian approved by the Scottish Ministers) and make amendments resulting from such provision. Regulation 3 (which amends regulation 2 of the Principal Regulations) makes related provision by modifying the definition of “unlicensed premises” and inserting definitions of “relevant approval” and “unlicensed processing premises”.
Regulation 9 (which amends regulation 28 of the Principal Regulations) modifies a condition regarding storage of semen, which must be satisfied in relation to the supply of frozen semen.
Regulations 10, 11, 12 and 13 (which respectively amend regulations 32, 34, 35 and 36) prevent application of provisions about the refusal, suspension and revocation of approvals of bovine animals, and provisions about review of decisions concerning such approvals, in relation to approvals of veterinary surgeons to supervise processing of bovine semen at unlicensed processing premises.
Regulations 14(b) and 15(b) respectively amend paragraph 2 of Part 1 of schedule 3 and paragraph 2 of Part 1 of schedule 5 of the Principal Regulations to modify the duties of centre veterinarians under those provisions so that centre veterinarians must ensure marking in the prescribed manner of each individual collection, rather than of each individual dose, of bovine semen collected at licensed collection centres and domestic collection centres. Regulations 14(a) and 15(a) make amendments associated with those amendments to schedules 3 and 5.
A business and regulatory impact assessment has been undertaken.

SCHEDULE 2EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Marriage (Prescription of Forms) (Scotland) Regulations 1997 to replace the form by which a person gives notice to the district registrar of their intention to marry. Regulation 3 amends the Gender Recognition (Marriage and Civil Partnership Registration) (Scotland) Regulations 2016 to replace the form by which the parties to a marriage can apply to have the marriage re-registered after either party, or each party, has been issued with a full gender recognition certificate.
The new forms differ from the previous forms only by an addition to the options available to each party to the marriage as to how they wish to be described in the marriage register and, where applicable, the marriage schedule. In addition to the options of being described as ‘bride’ or ‘bridegroom’ or not being assigned any designation the new forms give each party the option of being described as ‘groom’.

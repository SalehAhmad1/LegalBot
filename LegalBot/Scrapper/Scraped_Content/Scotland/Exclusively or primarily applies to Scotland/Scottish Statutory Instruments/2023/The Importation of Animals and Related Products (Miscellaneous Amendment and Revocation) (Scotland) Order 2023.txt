21st December 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends or revokes several orders made or having effect under the Animal Health Act 1981 which prohibit the importation of animals and related products, except under the authority of a licence.
Article 2 amends the Rabies (Importation of Dogs, Cats and Other Mammals) Order 1974, which regulates the importation into Great Britain of certain orders of mammals. It amends that order to provide that the prohibition on landing does not apply to dogs, cats and ferrets which meet requirements for importation provided for in retained EU law.
Article 3 amends the Importation of Animals Order 1977, which regulates the importation into Great Britain of ruminating animals, swine and elephants. It amends that order to provide that the prohibition on landing such animals, otherwise than under a licence, does not apply where the authorisation for importation of such animals is provided for in retained direct EU legislation.
Article 4 amends the Importation of Birds, Poultry and Hatching Eggs Order 1979, which regulates the importation into Great Britain of poultry, hatching eggs and captive birds. It amends that order to provide that the prohibition on landing poultry, hatching eggs and captive birds, otherwise than under a licence, does not apply where the authorisation for importation is provided for in retained direct EU legislation.
Article 5 amends the Importation of Embryos, Ova and Semen Order 1980, which regulates the importation into Great Britain of the embryos, ova and semen of any mammal (except humans) and the semen of poultry. It amends that order to provide that the prohibition on landing embryos, ova and semen, otherwise than under a licence, does not apply where the authorisation for importation is provided for in retained direct EU legislation.
Article 6 amends the Importation of Animal Products and Poultry Products Order 1980 which prohibits the importation into Great Britain of animal and poultry products otherwise than under a licence. It amends that Order to provide that the prohibition does not apply to animal and poultry products imported from Northern Ireland.
Article 7 revokes the Hares (Control of Importation) Order 1965, the Importation of Processed Animal Protein Order 1981, provisions amending those instruments and the Importation of Salmonid Viscera Order 1986, which are unnecessary because of other applicable legislation.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Spring Traps Approval (Scotland) Order 2011 (“the 2011 Order”). It comes into force on the 1 January 2024.
The 2011 Order specifies the types and makes of trap which are approved for use under section 50(1)(b) of the Agriculture Act 1948 (“the 1948 Act”). It is an offence to use a spring trap which is not approved for the purpose of that section and section 50(1)(c) of the 1948 Act creates offences relevant to unlawful use. This Order makes amendments to the categories of trap which are approved for use and amendments to the target species for traps approved for use.
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for this Order as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is anticipated.

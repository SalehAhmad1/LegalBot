The Scottish Ministers make these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 7(5)(1) and 14A(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No. 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings(2), Article 12(1)(3) of Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council on novel foods, amending Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1852/2001(4), and all other powers enabling them to do so.
In relation to Parts 2 and 3, the Scottish Ministers have sought the advice of Food Standards Scotland in accordance with Article 7(5) of Regulation (EC) No. 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings.
There has been consultation as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(5).

“E 960c REBAUDIOSIDE M PRODUCED VIA ENZYME MODIFICATION OF STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES FROM STEVIA
Synonyms
Definition
Rebaudioside M is a steviol glycoside composed predominantly of rebaudioside M with minor amounts of other steviol glycosides such as rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside I, and stevioside.
Rebaudioside M is obtained via enzymatic bioconversion of puriﬁed steviol glycoside leaf extracts (95% steviol glycosides) of the Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni plant using UDP-glucosyltransferase and sucrose synthase enzymes produced by the genetically modified yeasts K. phaffi (formerly known as Pichia pastoris) UGT-a and K. phaffi UGT-b that facilitate the transfer of glucose from sucrose and UDP-glucose to steviol glycosides via glycosidic bonds.
After removal of the enzymes by solid-liquid separation and heat treatment, the purification involves concentration of the rebaudioside M by resin adsorption, followed by recrystallisation of rebaudioside M resulting in a final product containing not less than 95 % of rebaudioside M. Viable cells or the DNA of the yeasts K. phafﬁi UGT-a or K. phafﬁi UGT-b must not be detected in the food additive.
Chemical name Rebaudioside M: 13-[(2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy]kaur-16-en-18-oic acid, 2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester

2.  In Table 2 (specifications) for the entry for UV-treated baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) substitute the following entry—
“UV-treated baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
Description/Definition
Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is treated with ultraviolet light to induce the conversion of ergosterol to vitamin D₂ (ergocalciferol). Vitamin D₂ content in the yeast concentrate varies between 800,000 - 3,500,000 IU vitamin D/100g (200-875 μg/g). The yeast is inactivated for use in infant formula, follow-on formula, processed cereal-based food, and food for special medical purposes as defined by Regulation (EU) No. 609/2013. The yeast can be active or inactive for use in other foods.
The yeast concentrate is blended with regular baker’s yeast in order not to exceed the maximum level in the pre-packed fresh or dry yeast for home baking.
Tan-coloured, free-flowing granules.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 3 amends the list of authorised food additives set out in Regulation (EC) No. 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on food additives to change the name and E number of the existing food additive steviol glycosides (E 960) to steviol glycosides from Stevia (E 960a), and to add the new food additive enzymatically produced steviol glycosides (E 960c). It also makes additional amendments to correct exisiting errors in that Regulation.
Regulation 4 amends Commission Regulation (EU) No. 231/2012 laying down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III of Regulation (EC) No. 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to change the heading of the specification for E 960 to refer to E 960a and to add a specification for E 960c.
Regulation 5 provides for a transitional measure to allow stocks of the food additive and any food containing it labelled with the existing E number E 960 to be exhausted.
Regulation 6 amends Regulation (EC) No. 1334/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1601/91, Regulations (EC) No. 2232/96 and (EC) No. 110/2008 and Directive 2000/13 to add a new food flavouring to the list of authorised flavourings and source materials.
Regulation 7 amends Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/2470 establishing the Union list of novel foods in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council on novel foods to add a new novel food and to substitute a new entry for an existing novel food so as to extend the specified food categories for which it is authorised and to provide for a new specification for it.

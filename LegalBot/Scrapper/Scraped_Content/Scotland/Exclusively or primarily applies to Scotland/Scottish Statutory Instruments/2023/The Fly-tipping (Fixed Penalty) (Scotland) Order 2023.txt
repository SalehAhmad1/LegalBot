(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 33A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”) provides for a fixed penalty notice procedure for an offence under section 33 in respect of a contravention of subsection 1(a) (for unauthorised deposit of controlled waste) or (1)(c) (for keeping or managing controlled waste in a manner likely to cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health). These offences are commonly referred to as fly-tipping. Payment of the fixed penalty in pursuance of a notice under section 33A of the 1990 Act operates to discharge any liability to conviction for an offence under section 33.
This Order increases the fixed penalty amount specified in section 33A(9) from £200 to £500.
A business and regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared for this Order as no impact upon business is foreseen.

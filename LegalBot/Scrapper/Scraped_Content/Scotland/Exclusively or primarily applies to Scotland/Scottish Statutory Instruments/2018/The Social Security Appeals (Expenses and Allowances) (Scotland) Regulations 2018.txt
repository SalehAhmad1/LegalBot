EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make ancillary provision under the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018. They enable a scheme to be administered for the payment of certain expenses and allowances of attendance where a hearing is held in connection with a social security appeal. This encompasses hearings relating to Scottish Ministers' exercise of functions under the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018, or regulations made under that Act which create a right of appeal. Expenses are to be payable, in appropriate circumstances, to parties (other than representatives of the Scottish Ministers) and to any witnesses cited to attend hearings of the Social Security Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland, or the Upper Tribunal for Scotland. Travel and subsistence expenses may be payable, as may allowances towards loss of earnings, where the loss or expense is reasonably incurred as a result of attending the hearing.

EdinburghEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring sections 21 and 22 and schedule 1 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”) into force on the day they appoint. These provisions relate to the Scottish Commission on Social Security.
Regulation 3 makes saving provision. This is to ensure that the commencement of these provisions of the 2018 Act has no effect on the arrangements made by regulation 4(2)(a) of the Scotland Act 2016 (Transitional) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/444). Those arrangements delay, for a transitional period, the transfer to the Scottish Ministers of the Secretary of State's functions in relation to certain disability and industrial injury benefits.
The Bill for the 2018 Act received Royal Assent on 1 June 2018. Part 7 of the 2018 Act (sections 95 to 100: final provisions) came into force the following day.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT ORDERS

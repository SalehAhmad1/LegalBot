(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes provision for the issue of phytosanitary certificates and phytosanitary certificates for re-export and for the provision of related services for the export of plants, plant products or other objects to third countries. It revokes and replaces the Plant Health (Export Certification) (Scotland) Order 2004 (S.S.I. 2004/248, as amended by S.S.I. 2007/137).
Phytosanitary certificates, phytosanitary certificates for re-export and IPC documents are required to accompany exports of certain plants, plant products or other objects to third countries.
The Order prescribes fees for the issue of these certificates and for related services (article 4 and the schedule). The Order authorises an inspector to enter any premises for the purpose of carrying out examinations or inquiries under the Order (article 3(3)).
Provision is made in the Order for offences in relation to procuring the issue of a phytosanitary certificates, phytosanitary certificates or IPC documents for re-export (article 5).
The fees prescribed by this Order are necessary to recover the costs expected to be incurred in the provision of the export services.

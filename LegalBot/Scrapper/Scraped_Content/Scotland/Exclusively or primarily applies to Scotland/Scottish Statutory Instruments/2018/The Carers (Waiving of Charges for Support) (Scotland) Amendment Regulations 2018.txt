(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Carers (Waiving of Charges for Support) (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (“the principal Regulations”).
The provision of services to both adult carers and young carers is, from 1st April 2018, to be administered under section 24 of the Carers (Scotland) Act 2016 (“the 2016 Act”).
Section 87(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 (“the 1968 Act”) allows a local authority to charge for services provided to a carer under section 24 of the 2016 Act. The power to charge for those services is subject (among other things) to regulations made under section 87(5) of the 1968 Act which provide for the waiving of such payments in specified circumstances.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations requires a local authority to waive charges for services provided to carers under section 24 of the 2016 Act and revokes regulation 3 of the principal Regulations.

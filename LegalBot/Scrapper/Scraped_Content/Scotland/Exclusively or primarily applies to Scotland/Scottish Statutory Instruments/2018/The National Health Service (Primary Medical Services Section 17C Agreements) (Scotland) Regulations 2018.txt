(5) The Scottish Ministers may determine the dispute themselves or, if they consider it appropriate, appoint a panel consisting of three persons (referred to as “the panel”) to consider and determine the dispute.
(6) Before reaching a decision as to who should determine the dispute under sub paragraph (5), the Scottish Ministers must, within the period of 7 days beginning with the date on which the dispute was referred to them, send a written request to the parties to make in writing, within a specified period, any representations which they may wish to make about the matter under dispute.

(b)
consult other persons whose expertise the adjudicator considers will assist the adjudicator in the adjudicator’s consideration of the matter.
(11) Where the adjudicator consults another person under sub-paragraph (10)(b), the adjudicator must notify the parties accordingly in writing and, where the adjudicator considers that the interests of any party might be substantially affected by the result of the consultation, the adjudicator must give to the parties such opportunity as it considers reasonable in the circumstances to make observations on those results.

(14) Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph and paragraph 59 and to any agreement by the parties, the adjudicator must have wide discretion in determining the procedure of the dispute resolution to ensure the just, expeditious, economical and final determination of the dispute.
(15) Where the adjudicator is a panel, any decision or determination by the panel for the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 59 may be by a majority.
Determination of dispute

(2) A determination of a reference to the Scottish Ministers for the purposes of section 17A(4) of the Act or in accordance with paragraph 57(1) may contain such directions (including directions as to payment) as the adjudicator considers appropriate to resolve the matter in the dispute, and it is the duty of the provider and the Health Board to comply with such directions.

the provision of advice in connection with the patient’s health, including relevant health promotion advice; and
(b)
the referral of the patient for other services under the Act.
(5) A provider must provide primary medical services required in core hours, taking into account the provider’s safety and the availability of other options for care, for the immediately necessary treatment of any person to whom the provider has been requested to provide treatment owing to an accident or emergency at any place in the provider’s practice area.
(6) In sub-paragraph (5), “emergency” includes any medical emergency whether or not related to services provided under the agreement.
(7) A provider must provide primary medical services required in core hours for the immediately necessary treatment of any person falling within sub-paragraph (8) who requests such treatment, for the period specified in sub-paragraph (9).

who is present in the provider’s practice area for less than 24 hours.
(9) The period referred to in sub-paragraph (7) is—

provide essential services, at such times, within core hours, as are appropriate to meet the reasonable needs of the provider’s patients; and
(b)

Attendance at practice premises
3.—(1) The provider must take steps to ensure that any patient who—

attends at the practice premises during the normal hours for essential services,

(a)
it is more appropriate for the patient to be referred elsewhere for services under the Act; or
(b)
the patient is offered an appointment to attend again within a time which is appropriate and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances and the patient’s health would not thereby be jeopardised.

assigned to that list by the Health Board,
the provider must, in addition to and without prejudice to its other obligations in respect of that patient under the agreement, invite the patient to participate in a consultation either at the provider’s practice premises or, if a medical condition of the patient so warrants, at one of the places referred to in paragraph 3(2) of schedule 1.

(2) The provider may demand and accept a reasonable fee when the provider treats a patient under sub-paragraph (1) for any treatment given, if the provider gives the patient a receipt.

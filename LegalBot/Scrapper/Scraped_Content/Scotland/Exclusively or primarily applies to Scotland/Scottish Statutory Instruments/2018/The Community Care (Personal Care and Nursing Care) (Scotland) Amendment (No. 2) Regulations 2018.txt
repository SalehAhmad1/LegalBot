(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 which, together with the Community Care (Personal Care and Nursing Care) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 (“the principal Regulations”), provide that local authorities are not to charge for certain types of social care provided or secured by them.
Regulation 2 revokes regulation 3 of the principal Regulations. This removes the qualification that the requirement not to charge applies only in relation to persons aged 65 or over.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order lists the name of every body which is not a recognised body falling within section 214(2)(a) or (b) of the Education Reform Act 1988 but which appears to the Scottish Ministers either–
(a)
to provide a course which is in preparation for a degree to be granted by a recognised body and is approved by or on behalf of the recognised body; or
(b)
to be a constituent college, school or hall or other institution of a university which is such a recognised body.
“Recognised bodies” are universities, colleges or other bodies which are authorised by Royal Charter or by or under Act of Parliament to grant degrees and other bodies for the time being permitted by those bodies to act on their behalf in the granting of degrees.
This Order updates and replaces the list of bodies contained in the Education (Listed Bodies) (Scotland) Order 2007 as amended by the Education (Listed Bodies) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009, which are revoked.
Part 1 of the schedule of this Order lists all of those bodies that appear to the Scottish Ministers to provide courses in preparation for a degree, whether generally, as listed in section 1 of the schedule, or in respect of a foundation degree only, as listed in section 2 of the schedule. Part 2 of the schedule lists all of those bodies that appear to the Scottish Ministers to be constituent colleges, schools or halls or other institutions of a university.
There are omitted from the schedule of this Order a number of bodies that were listed in previous Orders but which no longer provide courses that are approved by or on behalf of a recognised body. The schedule includes bodies that were not listed in previous Orders, but which now provide courses that are approved by or on behalf of a recognised body. The schedule also takes account of name changes since the Education (Listed Bodies) (Scotland) Amendment Order 2009 was made.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Letting Agent Registration (Scotland) Regulations 2016.
Regulation 2 makes amendments to the information required in an application for registration as a letting agent pertaining to client accounts or client money protection insurance. The amendment has the effect that there is no longer a requirement for registration to have a dedicated client bank account but instead to provide information as to whether or not the applicant has such an account.
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been carried out in relation to the letting agent Code of Practice and registration requirements. It has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Copies can be obtained from the Scottish Government Housing and Social Justice Directorate, Victoria Quay, Edinburgh, EH6 6QQ.

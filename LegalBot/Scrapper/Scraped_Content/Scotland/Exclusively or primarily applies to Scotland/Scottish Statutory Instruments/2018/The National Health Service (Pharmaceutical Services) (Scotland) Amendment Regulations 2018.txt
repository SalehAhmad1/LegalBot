(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2009 (“the 2009 Regulations”). Regulation 3 extends the definition of “prescriber” in regulation 2(1) of the 2009 Regulations by the insertion of a new category of independent prescriber, namely paramedic independent prescribers and also adds into that regulation a definition of “paramedic independent prescriber”.
Regulation 3 additionally amends the definition of “advanced electronic signature” also in regulation 2(1) of the 2009 Regulations to reflect the definition in article 3(11) of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23rd July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC and makes a consequential change by adding a new definition of “electronic signature”.

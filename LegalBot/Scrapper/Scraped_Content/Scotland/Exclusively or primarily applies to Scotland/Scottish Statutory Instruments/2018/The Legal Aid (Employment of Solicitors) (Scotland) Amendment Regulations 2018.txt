(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Legal Aid (Employment of Solicitors) (Scotland) Regulations 2001.
Regulation 2 replaces the requirement that solicitors must be employed by the Scottish Legal Aid Board (“the Board”) for the purpose of providing services for, or in connection with, any organisation but only where the Board has received a written request from the organisation for the services of a solicitor and the Board is satisfied that the services of a solicitor would enhance the services offered by that organisation. Instead the Board may employ solicitors for the purpose of giving advice and assistance, acting for persons receiving legal aid or assisting a local organisation concerned with the giving of advice or guidance.

The Order applies, to the designated area, various provisions of the 1991 Act and modifies them where necessary. It also makes consequential modifications to certain provisions of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act”) dealing with parking and related matters.
While the Order is in force, certain specified offences will be decriminalised: for example, in the case of the permitted parking area, breaches of orders relating to free on‑street parking places and, in the case of the special parking area, orders prohibiting or restricting waiting, loading and unloading.
Enforcement will be carried out by parking attendants provided under section 63A of the 1984 Act. A system of parking adjudicators will deal with disputes.

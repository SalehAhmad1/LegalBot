Part 2 of S.I. 2016/362.H YOUSAF
Authorised to sign by the Scottish Ministers
St Andrew’s House,
Edinburgh
16th May 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Instrument)
This Instrument amends the Traffic Signs Regulations 2016 and the Traffic Signs Directions 2016, together cited as the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 (“TSRGD 2016”), to correct errors and improve clarity. A reference in this note to a schedule is to a schedule of TSRGD 2016 and, unless otherwise indicated, references to regulations or directions are to regulations or directions contained in this Instrument.
Regulation 2(1)(b) of the TSRGD 2016 defines “the 1988 Act” as meaning “the Road Traffic Act 1988”. Regulation 3 omits that definition. Regulations 5(3), 6(3)(a), 8(2), 9(4), 13(4), 14(4) and 15 and general direction 2(4)(a) substitute “the Road Traffic Act 1988” for “the 1988 Act” in places where that latter term was previously used in TSRGD 2016.
Regulation 4 amends schedule 1. Regulation 4(2) corrects a spelling error in the definition of “bus lane”. Regulation 4(3) inserts a definition of “refuge for pedestrians and cyclists” (for use in relation to parallel crossings).
Regulations 5(2) and 6(2)(c) correct the descriptions for the signs provided for at item 5 in the table in Part 4 of schedule 2 and item 27 of the table in Part 2 of schedule 3 (height restrictions).
Regulation 6(2)(a) corrects an error in the heading to the table in Part 2 of schedule 3.
Regulation 6(2)(b) and (3)(b) makes amendments to item 10 of the table in Part 2 of schedule 3 and Part 4 of that schedule in respect of the sign provided for at item 10. Regulation 14(3)(a) makes an amendment to item 44 of the table in Part 2 of schedule 14. These amendments correct errors in how TSRGD 2016 provides for the enforcement of no entry signs.
Regulation 7 amends item 5 of the table in Part 3 of schedule 5 to remove material that ought not to have been included.
Regulation 8(3) amends paragraphs 2 and 3 of Part 6 of schedule 7, which apply to signs used at the entrances to schools etc, to correct incorrect references to item 12 of the table in Part 3 of schedule 4 (the references should be to item 10 of that table) and to omit text wrongly included in paragraph 3.
Regulation 9(2) amends the measurements in a diagram to correct an error in relation to the sign provided for at item 8 of the table in Part 6 of schedule 9. Regulation 9(3) amends paragraph 9(5)(e) of Part 7 of schedule 9 to refer to items 10 and 11 of the table in Part 6 of schedule 13 rather than items 9 and 10.
Regulation 10 amends Part 4 of schedule 10 to correct an erroneous cross-reference.
Regulation 11(2) and (3) amends the headings of Parts 2 and 4 of schedule 11.
Regulation 11(4) substitutes a new sub-paragraph (2) in paragraph 49 of Part 5 of schedule 11. Paragraph 49 applies to the markings provided for at item 25 of Part 4 of that schedule. As amended, sub-paragraph (2) is about using that marking next to a cycle lane.
Regulation 11(5) corrects an entry in the table relating to bar markings in paragraph 14 of Part 6 of schedule 11.
Regulation 12(2) omits a wrongly inserted “or” in paragraph 8(b)(i) of Part 1 of schedule 12 and regulation 12(3) and (4) corrects referencing errors in Parts 19 and 20 of that schedule.
Regulation 13 amends schedule 13. Regulation 13(2) corrects a paragraph numbering error. Regulation 13(3)(a), (b)(ii) and (5) corrects cross-referencing errors. Regulation 13(3)(b)(i) and (iii) provides for the insertion of a new paragraph in column 4 of item 5 in the table in Part 6 (flat traffic delineators) to correct an error in relation to the minimum permitted height of the sign. Regulation 13(3)(c) corrects an omission in relation to the bottom panel in the sign provided for at item 15 of the table in Part 6 (temporary road layout). Regulation 13(3)(d) corrects an error in a variant of the sign provided for at item 37 of the Part 6 table (permanent change in road layout).
Regulation 14(2) amends schedule 14 in respect of the amber lights that form part of the sign provided for at item 6 of the table in Part 2 (known as the “wigwag sign”) when the sign is used at a level crossing. Regulation 14(3)(b) and (c)(ii) and (iii) amends paragraphs 5 and 6 of the variants in column (4) of items 51, 52 and 53 in the table in Part 2 of schedule 14 to refer to a “refuge for pedestrians or a central reservation” (in the case of item 53, “refuge for pedestrians and cyclists or a central reservation”) rather than a “central refuge or reservation”, and to add reference to the possibility, on a one-way road, of the use of the markings shown in the second diagram at item 27 of the sign table in Part 4 of schedule 11. Regulation 14(3)(c)(i) also substitutes the correct diagram number for an incorrect number in item 53. By virtue of regulation 14(3)(d), the illumination requirements in paragraph 8 of Part 4 of schedule 14 do not apply to the signs provided for at items 58, 59, 60 and 62 of the table in Part 2 of that schedule (instead the illumination provisions in regulation 8(2) of the amended Regulations apply to those signs).
Regulation 16 corrects an error in the heading of schedule 17.
Direction 2(2) and (3) corrects cross-referencing errors in paragraph 7 of Part 9 of schedule 9 and paragraph 1 of Part 4 of schedule 10.
Direction 2(4)(b) corrects an error in paragraph 10 of Part 12 of schedule 13 applicable to items 19 and 21 of the table in Part 6 of that schedule (additional temporary signs).
A business and regulatory impact assessment has not been provided for this instrument as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

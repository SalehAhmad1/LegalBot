(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 94 of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 (“the Act”) defines who is a protected adult for the purposes of the Act. Under that section, the receipt of, among other things, a prescribed welfare service confers protected adult status on an individual. Section 97(1) of the Act provides that “prescribed” means prescribed in Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers. Regulation 5 of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 (Prescribed Services) (Protected Adults) Regulations 2010 (“the 2010 Regulations”) prescribes welfare services for the purposes of section 94(1)(d) of the Act. Consequently, persons who receive such services are protected adults. These Regulations amend the 2010 Regulations.
Regulation 4 inserts a new regulation 5A into the 2010 Regulations to qualify the meaning of a prescribed welfare service for the purposes of section 94(1)(d) of the Act. The new regulation 5A(1) excludes from that meaning a welfare service that is provided in the course of work within a prison by a prisoner to another prisoner. Receipt of such a service will therefore not confer protected adult status on a prisoner. The new regulation 5A(2) defines what is meant by “prison” and “prisoner” for these purposes.

(2) Information which is commercially confidential may only be included in the register if the person giving the information to SEPA consents to its inclusion.
(3) Nothing in this regulation prevents SEPA from including information in the register where it is contained in or otherwise held with other information not made available unless the information is not reasonably capable of being separated for the purposes of inclusion.Application for commercial confidentiality
41.—(1) Where information is given to SEPA for the purposes of these Regulations, the person giving it may apply to SEPA, at the same time the information is given to SEPA, to have the information excluded from the register on the ground that it is commercially confidential (as regards that person or another person).
(2) The application under paragraph (1) must include representations indicating why the applicant considers the information commercially confidential, together with such further information in support of the application as the applicant considers appropriate.
(3) The provisions of paragraph 6(2) and (3) of schedule 1 apply to an application under paragraph (1) as they do to any other application.
(4) SEPA must decide whether the information is commercially confidential and must give notice of its decision to the applicant within 28 days beginning with the date on which the application is received or within such longer period as SEPA may agree with the applicant in writing.
(5) If SEPA fails to give notice of its decision within the period allowed under paragraph (4), the information must be treated as commercially confidential.Review of decision on commercial confidentiality
42.—(1) SEPA may review a decision under this Part that information is commercially confidential.
(2) In carrying out a review under paragraph (1), SEPA must—
(a)
give the person to whom the decision relates notice that it is reviewing that decision; and

give the person a reasonable opportunity of making representations regarding the commercial confidentiality of the information, including an indication of why the person may consider that the information remains commercially confidential, together with such further information in support of those representations as the person considers appropriate.
(3) The provisions of paragraph 6(2) of schedule 1 apply to representations made under paragraph (2) as they do to an application.
(4) SEPA must decide whether or not the information remains commercially confidential and must give notice of its decision to the person.Effect of decision

44.  Nothing in this Part requires SEPA to include information on the register to the extent that its disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice substantially the course of justice, the ability of a person to receive a fair trial or the ability of any public authority to conduct an inquiry of a criminal or disciplinary nature.Register – exclusion of information affecting national security

(b)
varies a permit—
(i)
by including an off-site condition; or
(ii)

which includes an off-site condition.
2.—(1) SEPA may impose an off-site condition for any of the purposes specified in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) The purposes specified are—
(a)
where SEPA considers it necessary to impose an off-site condition to—
(i)
prevent or mitigate environmental harm;
(ii)
monitor the impact of the regulated activity on the environment or on human health; or
(iii)
restore the environment affected or likely to be affected by the regulated activity; and
(b)
where SEPA considers that—
(i)
a condition of a permit has not been complied with; and
(ii)
steps should be taken in order to remedy the non-compliance.
3.—(1) Before imposing an off-site condition, SEPA must (so far as is reasonably practicable) give notice under this paragraph to every person appearing to SEPA to be a person to whom sub-paragraph (3) applies.
(2) The notice must—
(a)
describe the proposed off-site condition;
(b)
describe the nature of the works or actions which the authorised person under the permit may be required to carry out or complete to comply with the off-site condition; and
(c)
state the representation period in relation to the condition, and the manner in which representations are to be made.
(3) This sub-paragraph applies to a person where—
(a)
that person is the owner, tenant or occupier of land or property affected by the off-site condition; and
(b)
rights will have to be granted by that person to the authorised person to enable the authorised person to comply with the proposed off-site condition.
(4) A person notified in accordance with this paragraph may make representations to SEPA regarding the off-site condition during the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which notice is given (“the representation period”).
(5) SEPA must consider any representations made within the representation period before imposing an off-site condition.
(6) Sub-paragraphs (4) and (5) do not apply where SEPA intends to issue a regulatory notice in circumstances where it considers that there is an imminent risk of environmental harm.
4.  Where SEPA imposes an off-site condition, it must provide a copy of the permit or notice containing the condition to every person specified in paragraph 3(3).
5.  A person (“person A”) whose consent is required for a person (“person B”) to comply with an off-site condition must grant (or join in granting) person B such rights in relation to the land as are necessary for person B to comply with an off-site condition.
PART 2
Compensation for off-site conditions
6.  This Part applies in any case where either—
(a)
(i)
SEPA has imposed an off-site condition; and
(ii)
a person has granted a right (an “off-site right”) which, alone or together with any other right, is necessary to enable a person to comply with the off-site condition; or
(b)
(i)
a person whose consent would be required for SEPA to arrange for steps to be taken under regulation 62(1), (2) or (3) has granted an off-site right to SEPA under regulation 62(6); and
(ii)
the off-site right, or that right together with any other right, is necessary to enable SEPA to arrange for those steps to be taken.
7.  The person to whom an off-site right has been granted must pay compensation to the person who has granted the right.
8.  But where a person (other than SEPA) has failed to make payment in accordance with paragraph 7 (“the person liable”)—
(a)
the compensation is payable by SEPA; and
(b)
SEPA is entitled to recover any payment of compensation made by it under this paragraph from the person liable.

depreciation in the value of any relevant interest which results from the grant of the offsite right;
(b)

(c)
loss of or damage to a relevant interest which—
(i)
is attributable to the grant of the off-site right or the exercise of that right;
(ii)
does not consist of depreciation in the value of that interest; and
(iii)
is loss or damage for which the grantor would have been entitled to compensation for disturbance if that interest had been acquired compulsorily under the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947(1) under a notice to treat served on the date on which the off-site right is granted;
(d)
damage to, or injurious affection of, any interest in land to which the grantor is entitled which is not a relevant interest, and which results from the grant of the off-site right or the exercise of that right;
(e)
loss in respect of work carried out by or on behalf of the grantor which is rendered abortive by the grant of off-site right or the exercise of that right;
(f)
the amount of any valuation and legal expenses reasonably incurred by the grantor in—

preparing the application for, and negotiating the amount of, compensation (up to the point of referral to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland under paragraph 14(2)).
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), an entitlement to compensation under this schedule arises on the date of the grant of an off-site right.
(2) The entitlement to compensation arises on the date of the final determination of the appeal where, after the grant of an off-site right, the condition of the permit which rendered the grant of that right necessary is upheld on an appeal against that condition.
11.—(1) An application for compensation under this schedule must be made by the person granting an off-site right within a period of—
(a)
six months beginning with the date on which the off-site right is first exercised; or

(b)
a description of the exact nature of any interest in land in respect of which the compensation is payable;
(c)
a statement of the amount of compensation applied for, distinguishing the amounts applied for under paragraph 9(a) to (f), and showing how the amount applied for under each sub-paragraph has been calculated; and
(d)
where the date on which the entitlement to compensation arises is ascertained in accordance with paragraph 10(2), a copy of the notice of the final determination of the appeal.
12.—(1) The amount to be paid by way of compensation must be assessed in accordance with this paragraph.
(2) The rules set out in section 12 of the 1963 Act have effect, so far as applicable and subject to any necessary modifications, for the purposes of this paragraph as they have effect for the purpose of assessing compensation for the compulsory acquisition of an interest in land.
(3) No account may be taken of any enhancement of the value of any interest in land, by reason of any building erected, work done or improvement or alteration made on any land in which the person granting the off-site right is (or was at the time of the enhancement) directly or indirectly concerned if—
(a)
the enhancement was not reasonably necessary; and
(b)
was undertaken with a view to obtaining compensation or increased compensation.
(4) In calculating the amount of any loss under paragraph 9(e), expenditure incurred in the preparation of plans or on other similar preparatory matters must be taken into account.
(5) Where the interest in respect of which compensation is to be assessed is subject to a standard security—
(a)
the compensation is assessed as if the interest were not subject to that security;
(b)
no compensation is payable to the creditor in respect of their interest in the land; and
(c)
any compensation payable in respect of the interest subject to the security must be paid to the—
(i)
creditor in that security; or
(ii)
if there is more than one creditor, to the first ranking of such creditors,
provided that the sum paid must not be more than the sum due to the creditor, and must be applied by the creditor as if it were proceeds of sale.

(c)

(3) If it appears to any person (“the first person”) that the first person may become liable to pay to another person (“the second person”) compensation or interest under this paragraph the first person may, if the second person requests the first person in writing to do so, make one or more payments on account of such compensation or interest.
(4) If, after a payment on account has been made under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
it is agreed or determined that compensation or interest is not liable to be paid; or
(b)
by reason of any agreement or determination, any payment under that sub-paragraph is shown to be excessive,
the payment or, as the case may be, excess is recoverable by the first person.
14.—(1) Compensation that is determined to be due is payable—
(a)
where—
(i)
the person to whom any off-site right was granted or, where compensation becomes payable by SEPA under paragraph 8, SEPA; and
(ii)
the grantor or a creditor in a standard security,
agree that a single payment is to be made on a specified date, on that date;

where—
(i)
the person to whom any off-site right was granted or, where compensation becomes payable by SEPA under paragraph 8, SEPA; and
(ii)
the grantor or a creditor in a standard security,
agree that payment is to be made in instalments at different dates, on the date agreed as regards each instalment; or
(c)
in any other case, subject to any direction of the Lands Tribunal for Scotland, as soon as reasonably practicable after the amount of the compensation has been finally determined.
(2) Any dispute in relation to the payment of compensation or interest must be referred to and determined by the Lands Tribunal for Scotland.
(3) In relation to the determination of any such question, sections 9 and 11 of the 1963 Act apply as if—
(a)
the reference in section 9(1) of that Act to section 8 of that Act were a reference to sub-paragraph (2); and
(b)
references in section 11 of that Act to the acquiring authority were references to the person to whom any off-site right was granted.

PART 3
Duties of SEPA
Optimisation and dose limits
26.—(1) SEPA must exercise its relevant functions in relation to radioactive substances activities to ensure that the radiation protection of individuals subject to public exposures is optimised.
(2) SEPA must exercise its relevant functions in relation to radioactive substances activities to ensure that the sum of doses to an individual does not exceed—
(a)
an effective dose of 1 millisievert in a year;
(b)
an equivalent dose for the lens of the eye of 15 millisieverts in a year;
(c)
an equivalent dose for the skin of 50 millisieverts in a year, averaged over any 1 cm2 of skin regardless of the area exposed.
(3) In these Regulations, “effective dose” and “equivalent dose” have the same meaning as in the Basic Safety Standards Directive.
(4) In order to estimate effective and equivalent doses, SEPA must use the values and relationships recommended in—
(a)
chapters 4 and 5 of ICRP Publication 116(10) for the estimation of doses from external exposure; and
(b)
chapter 1 of ICRP Publication 119(11) for the estimation of doses from internal exposure.
Dose constraints
27.—(1) In carrying out its relevant functions in relation to radioactive substances activities, SEPA must have regard to the following maximum doses which may result from the planned carrying on of a radioactive substances activity, for use at the planning stage in radiation protection—
(a)
0.3 millisieverts per year from any source from which radioactive discharges are first made on, or after, 13th May 2000; or
(b)
0.5 millisieverts per year from the discharges from any single site.
(2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), the maximum doses do not apply to doses which arise from medical exposures.
Estimation of doses to the members of the public
28.—(1) SEPA must make arrangements for the estimation of doses to members of the public from radioactive substances activities.
(2) The arrangements must be proportionate to the risk of exposure to radiation from the activities involved.
29.  SEPA must—
(a)
identify radioactive substances activities for which an assessment of doses to members of the public is to be carried out; and
(b)
specify that an assessment may be carried out either—
(i)
in a realistic way; or
(ii)
by screening assessment.
30.  Where it has specified that an assessment must be carried out in a realistic way, SEPA must—
(a)
decide on a reasonable extent of surveys to be conducted and information to be taken into account in order to identify the representative person, taking into account the effective pathways for transmission of the radioactive substances;
(b)
decide on a reasonable frequency of monitoring of the relevant parameters as determined in sub-paragraph (a);
(c)
ensure that the estimates of doses to the representative person include—
(i)
assessment of the doses due to external radiation, indicating, where appropriate, the type of the radiation in question;
(ii)
assessment of the intake of radionuclides, indicating the nature of the radionuclides and, where necessary, their physical and chemical states, and determination of the activity concentrations of these radionuclides in food and drinking water or other relevant environmental media; and
(iii)
assessment of the doses that the representative person, as identified in sub-paragraph (a), is liable to receive; and
(d)
keep records relating to—
(i)
estimates of intakes of radionuclides; and
(ii)
the results of the assessment of the doses received by the representative person.
Inspections
31.—(1) SEPA must establish and maintain a programme of inspections (a “radioactive substances activities programme of inspections”) for each type of radioactive substances activity.
(2) The programme must take into account—
(a)
the potential magnitude and nature of the hazard associated with each type of radioactive substances activity;
(b)
a general assessment of radiation protection issues in radioactive substances activities; and
(c)
the state of compliance with each of—
(i)
these Regulations;
(ii)
any authorisation.
(3) SEPA must prepare a report (a “radioactive substances inspection report”) on an inspection describing its findings from the inspection.
(4) SEPA must communicate a radioactive substances inspection report to any authorised person SEPA considers appropriate.
(5) SEPA must compile information (“radioactive substances protection and safety information”) relating to the protection of human health and the environment, and the safety of the public concerning—
(a)
significant lessons learned from inspections;
(b)
significant lessons learned from reported incidents and accidents; and
(c)
related findings.
Record keeping
32.—(1) SEPA must keep records of an authorisation granted for an activity involving a high-activity sealed source.
(2) The records must include details of—
(a)
the radionuclide in the source;
(b)
the radionuclide’s activity at the time of manufacture or, if not known, the activity at the time of the first placing on the market or at the time the authorised person acquired the source; and
(c)
the type of source.
(3) SEPA must keep the records up to date, including following transfer of a source.
Sealed sources
33.  SEPA must establish a system to enable an authorised person to inform SEPA of a transfer of a high-activity sealed source.
Orphan Sources
34.—(1) SEPA must, for the purpose specified in sub-paragraph (2), promptly provide specialised technical advice and assistance to a person who—
(a)
suspects the presence of an orphan source; and
(b)
does not normally carry on radioactive substances activities.
(2) The purpose is to ensure—
(a)
the protection of members of the public from radiation; and
(b)
the safety of the source.
35.—(1) SEPA must have plans, preparations or provisions in place to—
(a)
control and recover any orphan source; and
(b)
deal with an emergency due to an orphan source.
(2) The plans, preparations or provisions required by sub-paragraph (1) include the drawing up of appropriate response plans and measures.
36.—(1) Where SEPA is satisfied that radioactive waste ought to be disposed of and it is unlikely that the waste will be disposed of in accordance with an authorisation on the grounds that either—
(a)
the premises where the waste is located are unoccupied;
(b)
the occupier is absent or insolvent;
(c)
the occupier is a member of the public; or
(d)
for any other reason,
SEPA may serve a notice (“a radioactive waste disposal notice”) on a person requiring the person to dispose of the radioactive waste in a specified manner.
(2) The person on whom SEPA may serve a radioactive waste disposal notice includes the occupier of the premises where the radioactive waste is located or, if the premises are unoccupied, the owner of the premises.
(3) A radioactive waste disposal notice must specify—
(a)
the radioactive waste to be disposed of;
(b)
the person who is required to dispose of the radioactive waste;
(c)
the manner in which the radioactive waste is to be disposed of;
(d)
the date by which the radioactive waste is to be disposed of; and
(e)
the reasons why SEPA is satisfied that the radioactive waste is unlikely to be disposed of in accordance with an authorisation (which may include that the radioactive waste is on premises occupied by a member of the public).
(4) This sub-paragraph applies where SEPA has served a radioactive waste disposal notice and the person on whom it was served has failed to comply with it (in whole or in part).
(5) Where sub-paragraph (4) applies, SEPA may—
(a)
dispose of radioactive waste; and
(b)
recover from the occupier of the premises, or, if the premises are unoccupied, from the owner of the premises, any expenses reasonably incurred from disposing of the waste.
PART 4
Local authorities
37.  Where an authorisation requires or permits radioactive waste to be removed to a place provided by a local authority as a place for the disposal of waste, the local authority must—
(a)
accept any radioactive waste removed to that place in accordance with the authorisation; and
(b)
deal with it in the manner indicated in the authorisation.
38.  Where a local authority or relevant water authority takes any special precautions in respect of radioactive waste disposed of in accordance with an authorisation, and those precautions are taken—
(a)
in compliance with the conditions subject to which the authorisation was granted; or
(b)
with the prior approval of SEPA as being precautions which in the circumstances ought to be taken by that authority,
the local authority or relevant water authority is entitled to make such charges, in respect of the taking of those precautions, as may be agreed between that authority and the person to whom the authorisation was granted, or, in default of such agreement, as may be determined by SEPA and to recover the charges so agreed or determined from the person to whom the authorisation was granted.
PART 5

1968 c.47 as relevantly amended by the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 (asp 3), schedule 5, paragraph 41(b)(iv) and the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 (asp 3), schedule 3, paragraph 23(a).EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under sections 18 and 58 of the Regulatory Reform (Scotland) Act 2014 (2014 asp 3). They provide a framework for the authorisation of environmental activities (which are defined as regulated activities and currently include only radioactive substances activities) in Scotland. They repeal the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (1993 c.12), and provide a new regulatory framework for radioactive substances activities.
These Regulations transpose provisions of Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation and repealing Directives 89/618/Euratom, 90/641/Euratom, 96/29/Euratom, 97/43/Euratom and 2003/122/Euratom (OJ L 13, 17.1.2014, p.1) (“the BSSD”).
These Regulations come into force on 1st September 2018 and have effect subject to the transitional and savings provisions in schedule 5. A registration or authorisation under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 is deemed to be an authorisation. Activities which are not regulated under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 but which are radioactive substances activities under these Regulations will generally require an authorisation by the date falling after the end of a period of 6 months from the date these Regulations come into force.
Part 1 of these Regulations provides for meaning of terms used in these Regulations, and the requirement for a person in control of a regulated activity to have an authorisation. Regulation 9 provides for general aims which SEPA must take into account when carrying out its functions.
Part 2 of these Regulations provides for the carrying on of regulated activities in accordance with general binding rules. Schedule 9 sets out the general binding rules which are specified for radioactive substances activities.
Part 3 of these Regulations provides for the carrying on of regulated activities in accordance with a notification, including cessation of the activity and surrender of the notification.
Part 4 of these Regulations provides for the carrying on of regulated activities in accordance with a registration, including the form of applications, the content of a registration and the grant and variation of a registration.
Part 5 of these Regulations provides for the carrying on of regulated activities in accordance with a permit, including the form of an application, the content of a permit and the grant, variation and review of a permit. Schedule 1 makes further provision for the procedures for applying for and granting a registration or permit, and schedule 2 provides for the imposition by SEPA of requirements in permits and notices relating to land not controlled by the authorised person.
Part 7 allows for determination of standard rules. A permit or a registration may be subject to standard rules.
Part 8 of these Regulations provides for the transfer, revocation and surrender of registrations and permits.
Part 9 of these Regulations provides for the Scottish Ministers and SEPA having power to require information for specified purposes and for the requirement for SEPA to make information available to the public via a register. Provision is made for certain categories of information to be excluded from the register. Schedule 3 sets out the information to be included in the register.
Part 10 of these Regulations provides for enforcement. SEPA has power under regulation 46 to serve regulatory notices which can include a requirement for a regulated activity to cease. Regulatory notices may require action to be taken on land not in control of the authorised person.
Under Part 11 of these Regulations SEPA may serve a cost recovery notice requiring payment of the costs incurred in serving a regulatory notice or a remediation notice. Regulation 51 sets out the costs that may be recovered and the requirements for a notice. Regulation 54 contains provisions for the service of all forms of notice provided for in these Regulations.
Part 12 of these Regulations provides for appeals to the Scottish Ministers, for the effect of an appeal on the matter being appealed, and the determination of appeals by the Scottish Ministers. Schedule 4 makes further provision in relation to appeals.
Part 13 of these Regulations provide for SEPA’s functions and duties. SEPA is given power to impose authorisations, to escalate or de-escalate authorisations and to consolidate authorisations. Regulation 59 requires SEPA to carry out its functions in accordance with the technical schedule. Part 14 of these Regulations provides for the publication of guidance by SEPA.
Part 15 of these Regulations provides for the creation of criminal offences, as well as the creation of a defence and provision relating to the admissibility of evidence. Regulation 75 gives power to a court to order an offence to be remedied.
Part 16 allows the Scottish Ministers to give guidance to SEPA in relation to SEPA’s functions under these Regulations and in connection with the carrying on of a regulated activity by SEPA.
Part 17 provides that these Regulations bind the Crown with the exception of premises used by the Crown for defence purposes.
Schedules 6 and 7 provide for consequential modifications and repeals and revocations.
Schedule 8 is the technical schedule which defines the scope of a radioactive substances activity, and the specific requirements that apply to applications and authorisations for radioactive substances activities. Provision is made in this schedule for certain provisions in the BSSD, including Articles 5 and 12 (paragraph 26), 29(1) and (2) (paragraph 15), 65 to 67 (paragraphs 20 to 22), 85, 86 and 88 to 91 (paragraphs 23 to 25), 87 (paragraph 18), 90 (paragraph 32), 92 (paragraph 34), 94 (paragraphs 35 and 36) and 104 (paragraph 31).
A Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared and placed in the Environmental Quality Division, Directorate for Environment & Forestry, Victoria Quay, Edinburgh EH6 6QQ. An updated transposition note is submitted with the Policy Note which is available alongside the instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

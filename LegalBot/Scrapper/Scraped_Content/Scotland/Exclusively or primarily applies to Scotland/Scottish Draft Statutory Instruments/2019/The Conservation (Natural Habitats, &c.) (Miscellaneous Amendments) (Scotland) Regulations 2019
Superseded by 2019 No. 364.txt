WILDLIFE
The Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Scotland) Regulations 2019
Made
2019
Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1(2)
The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of schedule 2 of the European Communities Act 1972(1) (“the 1972 Act”) and all other powers enabling them to do so.
In accordance with paragraph 2(2) of schedule 2 of the 1972 Act, a draft of this instrument has been laid before and approved by resolution of the Scottish Parliament.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the 1972 Act and it appears to the Scottish Ministers that it is expedient for the references in these Regulations to the list of invasive alien species of Union concern adopted by the European Commission in accordance with Articles 4(1) and 10(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species(2) to be construed as references to that list as amended from time to time.

1972 c.68. Section 2(2) was amended by paragraph 15(3) of schedule 8 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c.46) (“the 1998 Act”) (which was amended by section 27(4) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c.51) (“the 2006 Act”)).

The functions conferred upon the Minister of the Crown under section 2(2), insofar as exercisable within devolved competence, were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act. Paragraph 1A of schedule 2 was inserted by section 28 of the 2006 Act and was relevantly amended by Part 1 of the schedule of the 2008 Act. Section 2(2) and paragraph 1A of schedule 2 are prospectively repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) from exit day (see section 20 of that Act).

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations primarily amend the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (“the 1981 Act”) to further implement Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species (“the Invasive Alien Species Regulations”). These Regulations extend to Scotland.
Regulation 2(2) inserts section 14AA into the 1981 Act, making it an offence for a person to contravene Article 7(1)(b) to (h) of the Invasive Alien Species Regulations (where the activity does not constitute an offence under sections 14, 14ZC or 14A of the 1981 Act).
Regulation 2(3) amends section 14C of the 1981 Act to extend the information that may be included in a code of practice made by the Scottish Ministers under that section. The information may now include which species, sub-species or lower taxons of animal, plant, fungus or micro-organism are considered to be invasive alien species. A code of practice may also include information on best practice for keeping an invasive alien species in a contained holding, best practice for measures to ensure that an invasive alien species cannot reproduce or escape, and the circumstances in which an invasive alien species is considered to be a companion animal.
Regulation 2(7) amends section 21 of the 1981 Act to make provision for penalties in respect of which a person, who commits an offence under section 14AA, section 19ZC (as amended by regulation 2(5)), or section 19ZD (as amended by regulation 2(6)), is liable.
Regulation 2(8) inserts schedule 9B into the 1981 Act. The schedule contains provision about defences to a charge of committing an offence under section 14AA, or section 14ZC or 14A where the activity to which the charge relates contravenes Article 7(1) of the Invasive Alien Species Regulations. Schedule 9B also contains provision restricting the granting of a licence under section 16(4)(c) of the 1981 Act (as amended by regulation 2(4)).
Regulation 3 amends the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 1994 to correct an error.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in paragraphs 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2, and paragraph 21(b) of schedule 7, of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(c) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of legal services and, in particular, amend legislation relating to the provision of legal services and the practice of law by European lawyers and Swiss lawyers within Scotland. Part 2 revokes the European Communities (Services of Lawyers) Order 1978 in so far as it extends to Scotland and the European Communities (Lawyer’s Practice) (Scotland) Regulations 2000. Part 3 and the schedule make consequential amendments, including to the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980, and transitional and saving provision.
The Scottish Government has prepared for these Regulations and is publishing on its website a Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Sheriff Court Simple Procedure (Limits on Award of Expenses) Order 2016 (“the 2016 Order”). Simple procedure was established by Chapter 1 of Part 3 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014.
The 2016 Order provides that expenses are not awardable where the value of a claim does not exceed £200. Article 2(2) amends that value from £200 to £300.
The 2016 Order provides that, where the value of a claim is between £200 and £1,500, the maximum sum awardable as expenses is £150. Article 2(3) amends the lower value of the claim from £200 to £300.
Article 3 provides that the amendments made by this Order do not affect any simple procedure case which was commenced prior to 1 April 2019.

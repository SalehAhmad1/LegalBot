(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make incidental provision for the purposes of, and to give full effect to, the Cost of Living (Tenant Protection) (Scotland) Act 2022 (“the 2022 Act”). This will ensure the new section inserted into Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the Private Housing (Tenancies) (Scotland) Act 2016 (“the 2016 Act”) by schedule 3 of the 2022 Act, as intended.
Regulation 2(2) renumbers the new section and amends the title of the section (and the preceding italic heading) to make it clear that the power is intended to permit modification of Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the 2016 Act.
Regulation 2(3) amends section 77 of the 2016 Act (regulation-making powers) in consequence of the renumbering.

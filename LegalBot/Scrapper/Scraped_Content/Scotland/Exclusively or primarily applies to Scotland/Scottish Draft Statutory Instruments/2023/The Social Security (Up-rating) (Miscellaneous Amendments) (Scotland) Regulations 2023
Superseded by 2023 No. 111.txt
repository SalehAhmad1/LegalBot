SOCIAL SECURITY
The Social Security (Up-rating) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Scotland) Regulations 2023
Made
2023
Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1(2), (3) and (4)
The Scottish Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 13 of the Social Security Act 1988(1), sections 70(8)(2) and 90(3) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and sections 28(2), 30(2), 31(2), 32(2), 34(2) and 95 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018(4), and all other powers enabling them to do so.
In accordance with section 97(2) of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018, the Scottish Ministers have informed the Scottish Commission on Social Security of their proposals, notified the Scottish Parliament that they have done so and made their proposals publicly available by such means as they consider appropriate.
In accordance with section 13(2) of the Social Security Act 1988, they have consulted with the Welsh Ministers(5).
In accordance with section 96(2) of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018(6), a draft of this instrument has been laid before and approved by resolution of the Scottish Parliament.
(1)
1988 c. 7. Section 13 was substituted by section 185(1) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 (c. 43) and amended by section 27(5) of the Scotland Act 2016 (c. 11) (“the 2016 Act”). The functions of the Secretary of State were transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46) (“the 1998 Act”) as read with sections 27(2) and 32 of the 2016 Act.
(2)
1992 c. 4. The function of making regulations to prescribe the circumstances in which a person is or is not to be treated as gainfully employed, for the purpose of carer’s allowance created under section 70 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”), transferred to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 53 of the 1998 Act as read with sections 22(2) and 32 of the 2016 Act. Section 22(2) of that Act inserted exceptions into the social security reservation in Head F1 of Part 2 of Schedule 5 of the 1998 Act relating to carer’s, disability and industrial injuries benefits. Section 22(2) was brought into force on 17 May 2017 by S.I. 2017/455, subject to transitional arrangements set out in S.I. 2017/444 which provided that pre-commencement functions would not transfer to the Scottish Ministers until the occurrence of a specified event or date. The transitional arrangements in respect of carer’s benefits were ended by the commencement of section 81 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 (asp 9) on 3 September 2018 (see S.S.I. 2018/250). The transitional arrangements in respect of carer’s benefits ended on 31 March 2020 (see regulation 4 of S.I. 2017/444). Accordingly, in so far as the functions under section 70 of the 1992 Act are exercisable within devolved competence, they are now exercisable by the Scottish Ministers instead of by the Secretary of State. The setting of relevant earnings limits falls within that responsibility. Section 122(1) of the 1992 Act contains a definition of the word “prescribed” relevant to the exercise of powers under which these Regulations are made. The requirement to consult the Social Security Advisory Committee under section 172 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (c. 5) does not apply to the Scottish Ministers by virtue of section 33 of the Scotland Act 2016 (c. 11).
(3)
The function of making an increase of carer’s allowance for child dependants under section 90 of the 1992 Act was transferred to the Scottish Ministers in the same way as the section 70 powers and as described in the previous footnote. The same applies to exercising the power in section 175 of the 1992 Act to make regulations setting out earnings limits in relation to entitlement to child dependency increase. An amendment was made to section 175(1) which is not relevant to these Regulations. Section 90 was relevantly amended by paragraph 26 of schedule 8 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (c. 30) and by article 2 of, and paragraphs 1 and 2 of the schedule of, S.I. 2002/1457. Section 90 was repealed by schedule 6 of the Tax Credits Act 2002 (c. 21) in respect of child dependency increase, subject to savings by article 3 of S.I. 2003/938. Section 90 was repealed for remaining purposes, namely in relation to adult dependency increase, by Part 2 of schedule 7 of the Welfare Reform Act 2009 (c. 24), subject to a saving by section 15(2)(b) of that Act, which saves such increase that relates to the amount of a carer’s allowance payable to a qualifying person at any time on or after 6 April 2010 but before the appropriate date as defined therein.
(4)
2018 asp 9. The powers to make these Regulations are exercised together by virtue of section 33(2) of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (asp 10). The Regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure by virtue of section 33(3) of that Act.
(5)
Functions conferred or imposed on the National Assembly for Wales immediately before the first appointment of a First Minister under section 46 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32) by an enactment contained in an Act were transferred to the Welsh Ministers by paragraph 30(2)(c) of schedule 11 to that Act.
(6)
Section 96(2) was amended by sections 5(8) and 14(4) of the Social Security Administration and Tribunal Membership (Scotland) Act 2020 (asp 18).Citation, commencement and interpretation

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for an increase in various values of forms of assistance payable by virtue of regulations made under the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 and make amendments to the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976, the Social Security Benefit (Dependency) Regulations 1977 and the Welfare Foods (Best Start Foods) (Scotland) Regulations 2019. The Regulations come into force on 1 April 2023, with the exception of regulations 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9, which come into force on 10 April 2022 and regulation 4 which comes into force on 3 April 2023.
Regulation 2 increases the value of Adult Disability Payment payable under the Disability Assistance for Working Age People (Scotland) Regulations 2022. Paragraph 1 of the schedule makes saving provision so that the previous value of this assistance is still payable in certain circumstances.
Regulation 3 increases the value of a transitional rate of Adult Disability Payment payable under the Disability Assistance for Working Age People (Transitional Provisions and Miscellaneous Amendment) (Scotland) Regulations 2022. Paragraph 2 of the schedule makes saving provision so that the previous value of this assistance is still payable in certain circumstances.
Regulation 4 increases the income thresholds in the Welfare Foods (Best Start Foods) (Scotland) Regulations 2019. This regulation also increases the amounts of the various values at which Best Start Food benefits are paid.
Regulation 5 increases the value of the three grants payable under the Early Years Assistance (Best Start Grants) (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (the pregnancy and baby grant, the early learning grant, and the school-age grant). Paragraph 4 of the schedule makes saving provision so that the previous value of this assistance is still payable in certain circumstances.
Regulation 6 amends regulation 8 of the Social Security (Invalid Care Allowance) Regulations 1976 (“the 1976 Regulations”) which increases the amount which a person eligible for payment of carer’s allowance from the Scottish Ministers can earn in a given week without being deemed to be gainfully employed and, therefore, losing their entitlement to carer’s allowance. The Social Security Amendment (Carer’s Allowance) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/2497) replaces references to “Invalid Care Allowance” with references to “Carer’s Allowance” in certain legislative provisions, but “Invalid Care Allowance” remains part of the title of the 1976 Regulations for statutory purposes.
Regulation 7 increases the value of Child Disability Payment payable under the Disability Assistance for Children and Young People (Scotland) Regulations 2021. Paragraph 5 of the schedule makes saving provision so that the previous value of this assistance is still payable in certain circumstances.
Regulation 8 increases the amount of child winter heating assistance payable under the Winter Heating Assistance for Children and Young People (Scotland) Regulations 2020. Paragraph 6 of the schedule makes saving provision so that the previous value of this assistance is still payable in certain circumstances.
Regulation 9 amends schedule 2 of the Social Security Benefit (Dependency) Regulations 1977. The effect is to increase the amount which the partner of a person eligible for payment of carer’s allowance from the Scottish Ministers can earn in a given week without the person receiving carer’s allowance losing any entitlement to what is payable by way of an additional payment where a recipient is entitled to receive child benefit in relation to a child or children. This addition is known as “child dependency increase” and is payable only to those with transitional protection. Child dependency increase was abolished by section 1(3)(e) and schedule 6 of the Tax Credits Act 2002 (c. 21) but saved for transitional cases by article 3 of the Tax Credits Act 2002 (Commencement No. 3 and Transitional Provisions and Savings) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/938).
Regulation 10 increases the amounts of funeral expense assistance payable under the Funeral Expense Assistance (Scotland) Regulations 2019. Paragraph 7 of the schedule makes saving provision so that the previous values of this assistance are still payable in certain circumstances.
Regulation 11 increases the amount of winter heating payment payable under the Winter Heating Assistance (Low Income) (Scotland) Regulations 2023. Paragraph 8 of the schedule makes saving provision so that the previous value of this assistance is still payable in certain circumstances.
Regulation 12 increases the value of Young Carer Grant payable under the Carer’s Assistance (Young Carer Grants) (Scotland) Regulations 2019. Paragraph 9 of the schedule makes saving provision so that the previous value of this grant is still payable in certain circumstances.

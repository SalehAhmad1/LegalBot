DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”). Section 2(1) of the 2009 Act (the interim targets) imposes a duty on the Scottish Ministers to ensure that the net Scottish emissions accounts for the years 2020, 2030 and 2040 are, respectively, at least 56%, 75% and 90% lower than the baseline (as defined by section 11(1) of the 2009 Act).
Regulation 2 amends section 2(1)(a) of the 2009 Act by modifying the percentage figure specified for the 2020 interim target. The 2020 interim target is modified from 56% to 48.5%. This modification has the effect of adjusting the annual target figures for 2021 to 2029 in accordance with section 3(2) of the 2009 Act (annual targets: 2021 to year before net-zero year).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

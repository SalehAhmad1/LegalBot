DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in the exercise of powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and paragraph 1(1) and (3) of schedule 2 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations amend legislation in the field of environmental protection and biosecurity. Part 1 amends Regulation (EU) No. 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species (“the IAS Regulation”) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1141 in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively. Part 2 amends the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to update that legislation in light of the amendments to the IAS Regulation in order to provide for enforcement of the IAS Regulation and emergency measures made under that regulation. Part 3 contains revocations.

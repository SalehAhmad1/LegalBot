S.S.I. 2013/2042.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for the transfer to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland General Regulatory Chamber of the functions of parking adjudicators. The office of parking adjudicator was created to hear appeals in connection with motor vehicle penalty charges under the Road Traffic Act 1991.
The First-tier Tribunal was established by section 1 of the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014. It is divided into chambers, with the chambers hearing cases according to their subject-matter. The First-tier Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber already has functions transferred from the Scottish Charity Appeals Panel. On 1 April 2020, parking adjudicators will transfer into, and become legal members of, the General Regulatory Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal.
Schedule 1 makes transitional provisions to manage the transfer of on-going casework.
Schedule 2 makes consequential amendments to legislation. It amends a number of orders which apply, and modify where necessary, various provisions of the 1991 Act and the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 for enforcing parking controls in designated parking areas in a number of local government areas in Scotland.
Schedule 3 revokes a number of instruments which prescribe the procedure to be followed in relation to appeals before parking adjudicators. The procedure to be followed before the First-Tier Tribunal will now be set out in regulations made under paragraph 4(2) of schedule 9 in the Tribunals (Scotland) Act 2014.

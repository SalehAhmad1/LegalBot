(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends schedule 2 of the Public Appointments and Public Bodies etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”) which lists the specified authorities that are subject to section 2 of that Act and so must comply with the code of practice published by the Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in Scotland.
Article 2 of the Order amends schedule 2 of the 2003 Act by adding, as an exception, an entry for a councillor appointed as a member of the board of Public Health Scotland following nomination by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). The effect of this is that these appointments made by the Scottish Ministers do not require to comply with the code of practice prepared under section 2 of the 2003 Act.

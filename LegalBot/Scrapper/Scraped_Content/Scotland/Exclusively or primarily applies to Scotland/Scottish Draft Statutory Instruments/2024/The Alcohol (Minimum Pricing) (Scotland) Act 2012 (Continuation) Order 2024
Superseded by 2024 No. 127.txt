(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under section 2(2) of the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012 (“the 2012 Act”). It comes into force on 30 April 2024.
Section 1 of the 2012 Act inserted provisions into schedules 3 and 4 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005, introducing a further mandatory condition of premises licences and occasional licences. The condition is that alcohol must not be sold on the premises at a price below its minimum price. These provisions are the “minimum pricing provisions”.
Section 2(1) of the 2012 Act provides that the minimum pricing provisions expire 6 years after section 1 of the 2012 Act came fully into force unless an Order is made under section 2(2) of that Act to continue the effect of those provisions. Section 1 of the 2012 Act came fully into force on 1 May 2018. This Order continues the effect of the minimum pricing provisions.

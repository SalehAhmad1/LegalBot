DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2009 (“the 2009 Order”).
The 2009 Order imposes an obligation (the “renewables obligation”) on all electricity suppliers which supply electricity in Scotland to produce a certain number of Scottish renewables obligation certificates in respect of electricity they supply to customers in Scotland during an “obligation period”. Each obligation period runs from 1st April to 31st March.
Article 3 amends article 2 of the 2009 Order (interpretation) to reflect that the definitions of “obligation level” and “revised obligation level” are now used for more than one purpose.
Article 6 inserts new article 12C into the 2009 Order which enables the Scottish Ministers to revise the renewables obligation for the obligation period beginning on 1st April 2024. A revision may only be made once, and cannot be made after 31st March 2024. Articles 4 and 5 make related minor amendments.

(4) Where an application is made within 6 weeks of the day on which the full name and date of birth of an individual (“the required data”) is submitted by, or on behalf of, the individual to the Scottish Ministers for the purpose of an application for Child Disability Payment, entitlement begins on whichever is the later of the day—

(2) This paragraph applies where, after the end of the period mentioned in paragraph (1), the individual no longer satisfies the eligibility rules.
(3) A determination of ongoing entitlement is made on the basis that—
(a)
the individual will continue to be entitled to Child Disability Payment for a fixed or indefinite period as specified in the notice of determination, and

(a)
with the agreement of the individual, or

(b)
in the case of an award of entitlement to a component or an increase pursuant to a determination made in accordance with regulation 31(a) as a result of the individual reporting a change that affects their eligibility under regulation 11 (care component criterion: lowest, middle or highest rate of care component), 12 (mobility requirements: lower rate mobility component) or 13 (mobility requirements: higher rate mobility component), on the date when—
(i)
if the individual reports the change within one month of the change occurring, the individual first satisfies the requirements for a higher rate of the care or mobility component,
(ii)
if the individual reports the change more than one month but not more than 13 months of the change occurring, the individual first satisfies the requirements for a higher rate of the care or mobility component, but only if the Scottish Ministers consider that the individual had good reason for not notifying the change within one month, or

Determination without application of entitlement to Child Disability Payment
9.—(1) The Scottish Ministers are to make a determination without application in respect of a transferring individual of that individual’s entitlement to Child Disability Payment.

(3) The determination under sub-paragraph (1) is to be made on the basis of—
(a)
such information as the Scottish Ministers have received from the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in respect of the transferring individual’s entitlement to Disability Living Allowance, and

any other information available to the Scottish Ministers that appears to them to be relevant.
(4) Subject to paragraph 11, a determination under sub-paragraph (1) must be made on the basis that the transferring individual is entitled to the components and rates of Child Disability Payment that are equivalent to those components and rates of Disability Living Allowance to which the individual was entitled immediately before the date of transfer.

Exceptions to paragraph 9(4)
11.  The following circumstances are exceptions to paragraph 9(4)—
(a)
a transferring individual who is either not entitled to or entitled to the lower rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance immediately before the date of transfer, is entitled to the higher rate for the mobility component of Child Disability Payment where special rules for terminal illness under regulation 15 (entitlement under special rules for terminal illness) apply to that transferring individual,
(b)
a transferring individual who is not awarded the care component of Disability Living Allowance and meets the condition in regulation 11(1)(b) (care component criterion: lowest, middle or highest rate of care component) is entitled to the lowest rate of the care component of Child Disability Payment,
(c)
a transferring individual whose entitlement to either component of Disability Living Allowance was affected because they were under 16 and did not meet the requirement in section 72(1A)(b) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992(2), who is aged 16 or over is entitled to an increased rate of either component or both components of Child Disability Payment, and

a transferring individual, whose entitlement to the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance was affected by not meeting the requirement of regulation 12(1A) of the Social Security (Disability Living Allowance) Regulations 1991(3), who meets the condition in regulation 13(5) (mobility requirements: higher rate mobility component), is entitled to—
(i)
the lower rate of the mobility component of Child Disability Payment where the individual was not entitled to the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance, or
(ii)
to the higher rate of the mobility component of Child Disability Payment where the individual was entitled to the lower rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance.
Effect of legal custody on payment of the mobility component
12.  Where a transferring individual is in legal detention immediately before the date of transfer and payment of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance is suspended under regulation 3 of the Social Security (General Benefit) Regulations 1982(4), the mobility component of Child Disability Payment is to be paid at the rate equivalent to the rate of Disability Living Allowance paid to the transferring individual immediately prior to the suspension.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for Child Disability Payment which is a type of disability assistance given by the Scottish Ministers under section 31 of the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018.
Part 2 provides an overview of arrangements for payment of disability assistance for children and young people (“Child Disability Payment”).
Part 3 deals with eligibility for the assistance on account of having a disability, including age criteria, residence and presence conditions, entitlement to other benefits, care component criterion and mobility requirements.
Part 4 sets out rules of entitlement to the assistance on account of having a terminal illness, and when undergoing dialysis at home.
Part 5 deals with the effect on entitlement to the care component of the assistance of residence when in a care home or hospital or in legal detention.
Part 6 deals with the making of applications, payments, the amount and form of Child Disability Payment and ongoing eligibility. It also provides for when increases or decreases of entitlement take effect and giving assistance by way of deduction.
Part 7 deals with reconsideration of entitlement, where an award of assistance has already been made and is being revisited. It provides for determinations without application to be made where a specified period has elapsed, there is a change in circumstances, to address error or official error or to effect a deduction decision.
Part 8 deals with the situation where people in receipt of the assistance, and the DWP equivalent, move to and from Scotland, from other parts of the United Kingdom.
Part 9 provides for time periods for dealing with requests for re-determination of entitlement.
Part 10 makes provision for the Scottish Ministers to make payment to suppliers of adapted vehicles, with whom recipients of the assistance have entered agreements for hire or hire purchase. These suppliers must be accredited according to a scheme operated by the Scottish Ministers.

Part 15 deals with an initial period for applications by way of transitory provision.

These Regulations amend article 9(3) of the Sea Fishing (Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing) (Scotland) Order 2013 to reflect amendments made by the Common Fisheries Policy (Amendment etc.) Regulations 2021 to Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1005/2008(1), thereby facilitating the access to the market within Great Britain of qualifying Northern Ireland goods. The term “qualifying Northern Ireland goods” is defined in the Definition of Qualifying Northern Ireland Goods (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1454).
No business and regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations as no impact upon business, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

(3) The operational monitoring programme must include monitoring of somatic coliphages in raw water in accordance with the following table—
Operational parameter Reference value Unit Notes
Somatic coliphages 50 (for raw water) PFU/100ml
This parameter must be measured if the risk assessment under regulation 30 indicates that it is appropriate to do so.
If it is found in raw water at concentrations > 50 PFU/100ml, it must be analysed after steps of the treatment train in order to determine log removal by the barriers in place and to assess whether the risk of a breakthrough of pathogenic viruses is sufficiently under control.

(ii)
as a result of abstraction through the public water supply system,
contains a parameter at a concentration or value which would (whether in conjunction with another parameter in the water or otherwise) constitute a potential danger to human health, or
(e)
a risk assessment has identified extension of the list of parameters and/or increase of the minimum sampling frequencies as the most appropriate means of mitigating a risk to human health.”,

(aa)
in the catchment area used to abstract water for human consumption purposes, and

as a result of abstraction through the public water supply system,
at a concentration or value which would (whether in conjunction with another parameter in the water or otherwise) constitute a potential danger to human health,

where a parameter from the list of parameters to be monitored under Part B of this schedule can only occur as a result of the treatment technique or disinfection method, that technique or method is not used by Scottish Water, or
(iii)
the specifications in paragraph 3A are complied with.”,

(d)
the removal of a parameter from the list of parameters to be monitored under Part B of this schedule must be based on the result of the risk assessment, informed by the results of monitoring of sources of water and confirming that human health is protected from the adverse effects of any contamination of water, and
(e)
for a reduction in the minimum sampling frequency for a parameter under Part B of this schedule or removal of a parameter from the list of parameters to be monitored under that Part, the risk assessment confirms that no factor (that can be reasonably anticipated) is likely to cause deterioration of the quality of the water.
3B.  Any parameter removed from the list of parameters to be monitored in Part B of this schedule under paragraph 3(b) must be monitored—
(a)
at least once every six years, and
(b)

Notes—
Note 1: Water must not be aggressive or corrosive. This applies particularly to water undergoing treatment (demineralisation, softening, membrane treatment, reverse osmosis, etc.).
Note 2: Where water intended for human consumption is derived from treatment that significantly demineralises or softens water, calcium and magnesium salts could be added to condition the water in order to reduce any possible negative health impact, as well as to reduce the corrosiveness or aggressivity of water and to improve taste. Minimum concentrations of calcium and magnesium or total dissolved solids in softened or demineralised water could be established taking into account the characteristics of water that enters those processes.
Note 3: The water must not be corrosive.
Note 4: This parameter must be measured if a risk assessment under regulation 30(2) indicates that it is appropriate to do so.
Note 5: For water put into bottles or containers (which is not intended for sale for drinking by humans), the unit is number/250ml.
Note 6: The water must not be aggressive.
Note 7: For water put into bottles or containers (which is not intended for sale for drinking by humans), the minimum value is 4.5 pH units.
Note 8: This parameter need not be measured for supplies of less than 10,000 m³ a day.
Note 9: Remedial action is to be deemed justified on radiological protection grounds, without further consideration where radon concentrations exceed 1,000 Bq/l.

“Minimum performance characteristic: uncertainty of measurement
Parameter Uncertainty of measurement (% of prescribed concentration or value, except pH) (Note 1) Notes
Notes—
Note 1: Uncertainty of measurement is a non-negative parameter characterising the dispersion of the quantity values being attributed to a measurand, based on the information used. The performance criterion for measurement uncertainty (k = 2) is the percentage of the parametric value stated in the table or any stricter value. The uncertainty of measurement must be estimated at the level of the parametric value, unless otherwise specified.
Note 2: If the value of uncertainty of measurement cannot be met, the best available technique must be selected (up to 60%).
Note 3: The method determines total cyanide in all forms.
Note 4: The value for the uncertainty of measurement is expressed in pH units.
Note 5: Reference method European standard EN ISO 8467:1995 entitled “ Water quality - Determination of permanganate index (ISO 8467:1993)” (1).
Note 6: The performance characteristics for individual pesticides are given as an indication. Values for the uncertainty of measurement as low as 30 % can be achieved for several pesticides, higher values up to 80% may be allowed for a number of pesticides.
Note 7: The performance characteristics apply to individual substances, specified at 25% of the prescribed concentration or value for the corresponding parameter in Table B.
Note 8: The performance characteristics apply to individual substances, specified at 50% of the prescribed concentration or value for the corresponding parameter in Table B.
Note 9: The uncertainty of measurement must be estimated at the level of 3 mg/l of the total organic carbon in accordance with European standard EN 1484:1997 entitled “ Water analysis - Guidelines for the determination of total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon” (2).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Public Water Supplies (Scotland) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”) to implement partially Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of water intended for human consumption (“the Directive”), to address deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and to make some further minor amendments.
Regulation 3 amends the definitions of “parameter”, “prescribed concentration or value” and “water quality standards” in regulation 2 of the 2014 Regulations.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 6 of the 2014 Regulations to provide that Scottish Water may remove a parameter from a monitoring programme.
Regulation 6 amends the provision on sampling in relation to water supplied by tankers in regulation 13 of the 2014 Regulations and also disapplies it in relation to mobile tankers. Regulation 7 makes new provision for sampling in relation to water supplied by mobile tanker.
Regulation 9 and 13 transfer functions in relation to authorisation of temporary supply of water that is not wholesome from the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux to Consumer Scotland which was established under section 1 of the Consumer (Scotland) Act 2020.
Regulations 10, 11 and 12 amend the 2014 Regulations to omit references to the process whereby the European Commission could grant a third temporary departure from the requirements of the 2014 Regulations.
Regulation 14 amends regulation 31 of the 2014 Regulations to remove the functions in relation to risk assessment procedures from the Scottish Ministers and to transfer those functions to the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland.
Regulation 15 amends regulation 33 of the 2014 Regulations to omit requirements applicable to products and substances that may be applied to or introduced into water intended for human consumption which no longer operate effectively following the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Regulation 16 amends schedule 1 of the 2014 Regulations to replace Table B and Table C (and the notes to those tables) with new tables containing the water quality standards of the Directive. Regulations 5 and 8 make minor amendments that are required as a result of the new numbering of chemical parameters in Table B.
Regulation 17 amends schedule 1A of the 2014 Regulations to introduce the requirement that Scottish Water maintain an operational monitoring programme and to revise the conditions on which the Scottish Water may deviate from the minimum monitoring requirements (pursuant to Article 9(4) of the Directive).
Regulation 18 amends schedule 3 of the 2014 Regulations to replace Table 1 of that schedule with a new table that contains the minimum performance characteristics of the Directive.

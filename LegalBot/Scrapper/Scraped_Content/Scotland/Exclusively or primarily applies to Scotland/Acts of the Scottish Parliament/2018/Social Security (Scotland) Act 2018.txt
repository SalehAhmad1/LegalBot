A request for a re-determination satisfies the condition in subsection (4) of section 41, despite being made after the expiry of the period described in paragraph (b) of that subsection, if the person deciding whether the individual has a good reason for not requesting a re-determination sooner decides that the individual has a good reason that is related to coronavirus.
(2)
An appeal may be brought under section 46, despite the appeal application being made after the expiry of the period described in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 48, if the First-tier Tribunal gives permission for the appeal to be brought under paragraph (b) of that section on the basis of being satisfied that the good reason for the application not being made sooner is related to coronavirus.
(3)
Any provision of Scottish Tribunal Rules that would (but for this subsection) have the effect of precluding an appeal being brought by virtue of subsection (2) is to be disregarded to the extent that it would have that effect.

(2)
If the individual fails to provide the requested information by the end of the [F3the period specified under subsection (1) or (1B)] the Scottish Ministers may, without further consideration, proceed to make the determination on the basis that the eligibility rules prescribed in the applicable regulations are not satisfied in the individual's case (see section 50).

(a)
1 April to 30 September, and
(b)
1 October to 31 March.
[F1(1A)
A qualifying individual is an individual to whom subsection (2) or (2A) applies.]
(2)

(ii)
carer support payment under the Carer’s Assistance (Carer Support Payment) (Scotland) Regulations 2023 (S.S.I. 2023/302), and]
(b)
resident in Scotland.
[F4(2A)
This subsection applies to an individual whom the Scottish Ministers have determined in accordance with Part 2 of the Carer’s Allowance Supplement and Young Carers Grants (Residence Requirements and Procedural Provisions) (EU Exit) (Scotland) Regulations 2020 (S.S.I. 2020/475)—
(a)
met the eligibility conditions in subsection (9) on the qualifying date (where the qualifying date is before IP completion day),
(b)
met the eligibility conditions in subsection (11) on the qualifying date (where the qualifying date is after IP completion day and the individual has rights arising from a relevant EU regulation), or
(c)
met the eligibility conditions in subsection (13) on the qualifying date (where the qualifying date is after IP completion day and the individual has rights arising from the UK-Ireland convention mentioned in that subsection).]
(3)
The qualifying date is a date determined by the Scottish Ministers falling within the period to which the payment relates.
(4)
The amount of a carer's allowance supplement is to be calculated according to the following formula [F5(but see also subsection (4B))] —
where—
JSA is whichever is the higher of—
(a)
the weekly amount specified in regulation 79(1)(c) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/207) as it has effect on the qualifying date, and
(b)
that amount as it would have effect on the qualifying date if it were adjusted for inflation in accordance with subsection (5), and
CA is the weekly rate of carer's allowance specified in Part 3 of schedule 4 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 as it has effect in Scotland on the qualifying date.
[F6(4B)
The amount of a carer’s allowance supplement in respect of the period of 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 is £231.40 greater than that calculated according to the formula in subsection (4).]
(5)
The Scottish Ministers must, before the start of each new tax year, beginning with the first new tax year beginning after this section comes into force—
(a)
calculate what the weekly amount specified in regulation 79(1)(c) of the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations 1996 (“the JSA Regulations”) would be if it were adjusted for inflation,
(b)
publish a statement explaining how they have calculated inflation for this purpose.
(6)
In calculating the amount for the purpose of subsection (5)(a), the Scottish Ministers may take account of any change in the weekly amount specified in regulation 79(1)(c) of the JSA Regulations since this section came into force.
(7)
For the purposes of subsection (5), a tax year means a period beginning with 6 April in one year and ending with 5 April in the next.

(c)
was resident in—
(i)
Switzerland, or
(ii)
an EEA State other than the United Kingdom, and
(d)
had a genuine and sufficient link to Scotland.
(10)
The reference in subsection (9)(d) to an individual’s link to Scotland being sufficient is to it being sufficiently close that if the individual were not entitled to the carer’s allowance supplement this section—
(a)
would be incompatible with EU law, or
(b)
would have been incompatible with EU law immediately before IP completion day.
(11)
An individual met the eligibility conditions referred to in subsection (2A)(b) on a given date if, on that date, the individual—

was resident in—
(i)
Switzerland,

an EEA State, or
(iii)
Gibraltar, and
(d)
had a genuine and sufficient link to Scotland.
(12)
The reference in paragraph (d) of subsection (11) to an individual’s link to Scotland being sufficient is to it being sufficiently close that if the individual were not entitled to the carer’s allowance supplement this section would be incompatible with the applicable agreement mentioned in paragraph (b)(i) of that subsection.
(13)
An individual met the eligibility conditions referred to in subsection (2A)(c) on a given date if, on that date, the individual—
[F10(a)

(c)
was resident in Ireland, and
(d)
had a genuine and sufficient link to Scotland.
(14)
The reference in paragraph (d) of subsection (13) to an individual’s link to Scotland being sufficient is to it being sufficiently close that if the individual were not entitled to the carer’s allowance supplement, this section would be incompatible with the convention mentioned in paragraph (b) of that subsection.
(15)
In this section—
“EEA State” means—
(a)
a member State of the European Union, or
(b)
any other State that is a party to the agreement on the European Economic Area signed at Oporto on 2 May 1992, together with the Protocol adjusting that Agreement signed at Brussels on 17 March 1993, as modified or supplemented from time to time, “EU law” has the meaning given by subsection (9) of section 126 of the Scotland Act 1998, or if that subsection has been repealed, the meaning given by that subsection immediately before its repeal,

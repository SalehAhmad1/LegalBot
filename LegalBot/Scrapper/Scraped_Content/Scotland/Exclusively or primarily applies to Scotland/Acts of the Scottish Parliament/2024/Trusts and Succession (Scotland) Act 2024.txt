(2)
The advance may be on such conditions (if any) as the trustees consider it reasonable to impose.
(3)
But the trustees may subsequently waive or vary any condition imposed under subsection (2) if they consider it appropriate to do so.
(4)
A right to the capital advanced must, as at the date on which the advance is made, be destined to vest in the beneficiary—
(a)
unconditionally,
(b)
subject, if an uncertain future event were to occur, to defeasance or diminution, or
(c)
on the occurrence of an uncertain future event.
(5)
Either—
(a)
the consent must have been obtained of any person who has a prior interest as respects the trust property, being an interest which would be prejudiced were the advance made, or

(9)
It is not an objection to an advance to the beneficiary under this section that the advance is made by setting up a new trust for the benefit of the beneficiary and transferring the capital advanced as assets to be held in that new trust (or, without setting up a new trust, by transferring the capital advanced to assets for the time being held in any trust for the benefit of the beneficiary).
(10)

(4)
The information is to be provided within such period as is reasonable in all the circumstances; except that if the person to be informed is a beneficiary who has acquired an immediate interest in the trust property the information must be provided as soon as is reasonably practicable.

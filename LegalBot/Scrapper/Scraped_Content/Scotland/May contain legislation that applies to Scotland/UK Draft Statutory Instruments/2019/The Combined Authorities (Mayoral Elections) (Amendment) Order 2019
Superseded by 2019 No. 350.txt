(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Combined Authorities (Mayoral Elections) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/67) (“the 2017 Order”). The amendments made by this Order will apply in relation to combined authority mayoral elections taking place in England in respect of which the date of the poll stated in the notice of the election is on or after 2nd May 2019.
Rule 6 of the Combined Authority Mayoral Election Rules found in Schedule 1 to the 2017 Order (“the CAMERs”) requires candidates at a combined authority mayoral election to be nominated by completing a nomination paper. That paper must include the candidate’s home address. That home address will then be published both in the statement of persons who have been nominated to stand at the election and also the ballot paper for the election.
Where a mayor is also to exercise the functions of a police and crime commissioner (“PCC functions”), the candidates may state on their nomination paper that they do not want their home address to be published. If a candidate makes such a statement, they must state their “relevant local government electoral area”. It is that area that will appear in the statement of persons nominated and the ballot paper (rule 6(7) of the CAMERs).
The CAMERs are amended so that in future information about a candidate’s home address will be provided in a “home address form” and any candidate will be able to state that they do not want their home address to be made public. A candidate making such a statement must provide the relevant area within which their home address is situated.
The information to be stated on the home address form is set out in new rule 6(6) of CAMERs. That information will also include candidates’ qualifying addresses and the address of the person witnessing their consent to nomination. These addresses are currently given in the candidates consent to nomination.
Corresponding amendments are made to the Combined Authority Mayoral Election (Combination of Polls) Rules found in Schedule 3 to the 2017 Order (see article 5).

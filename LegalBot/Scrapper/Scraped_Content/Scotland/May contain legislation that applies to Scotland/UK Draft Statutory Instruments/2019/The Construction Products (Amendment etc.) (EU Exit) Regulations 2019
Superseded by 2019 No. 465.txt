4.  When developing a standard in response to a standardisation mandate, a recognised standardisation body must consult with such persons as it considers appropriate on the content of the standard.
5.  A standard must:
(a)
provide the methods and the criteria for assessing the performance of the construction products in relation to their essential characteristics;
(b)
when provided for in the relevant standardisation mandate, refer to an intended use of products to be covered by it;

where appropriate and without endangering the accuracy, reliability or stability of the results, provide methods less onerous than testing for assessing the performance of the construction products in relation to their essential characteristics;
(d)
determine the applicable factory production control, which must take into account the specific conditions of the manufacturing process of the construction product concerned;

(a)
a standard which is prepared by a recognised standardisation body and satisfies the requirements of Article 18A(5);
(b)
a harmonised standard which is adopted by a European standardisation body before, or on or after exit day, which does not become designated under paragraph 2.
2.  Where, immediately before exit day -
(a)
a reference to a harmonised standard has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union under this Regulation; and
(b)
a British standard transposing the harmonised standard has been adopted,
the British standard becomes a designated standard on exit day; and the Secretary of State must, as soon as reasonably practicable after exit day, publish a reference to that standard.
The coexistence period for the standard is the period established by the European Commission under Article 17(5) as it had effect immediately before exit day.
3.  Before designating a standard under paragraph 1, the Secretary of State must have regard to whether the standard is consistent with any international standards which the Secretary of State considers to be relevant.
4.  The Secretary of State is to designate a standard under paragraph 1 by publishing the reference to the standard and maintaining that publication in such manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.
Where the standard is a harmonised standard, the published reference may be the reference to a British standard transposing the harmonised standard.
5.  Alongside a reference to a standard designated under paragraph 1, the Secretary of State must publish:
(a)
the references of any superseded harmonised technical specifications;
(b)
the date of the beginning of the coexistence period;
(c)
the date of the end of the coexistence period.
6.  The Secretary of State may change the date of the beginning or end of the coexistence period for a designated standard to a later date by publishing the revised date in such manner as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.
7.  When considering whether the manner of publication of a reference or a revised date is appropriate, the Secretary of State must have regard to whether the publication will draw the standard or the revised date to the attention of any persons who may have an interest in it.
8.  Without prejudice to Articles 36 to 38, from the date of the end of the coexistence period, the designated standard is to be the only means used for drawing up a declaration of performance for a construction product covered by it.
At the end of the coexistence period, any other national standards are to be treated as invalid to the extent that they are inconsistent with the designated standard.
9.  Where a designated standard is a harmonised standard:
(a)
the provisions of the harmonised standard which address the EU Construction Products Regulation are to be treated as the provisions of the designated standard which address this Regulation;
(b)
any reference in the harmonised standard to a system of assessment and verification of constancy of performance under the EU Construction Products Regulation is to be treated as a reference to the equivalent system under this Regulation.
Article 18C
Objection to a designated standard
1.  Where the Secretary of State considers that a designated standard is no longer appropriate, the Secretary of State may, after consulting with such persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate, decide to maintain, maintain with restriction or withdraw the reference to the designated standard.
2.  Where the standard was prepared by a recognised standardisation body in response to a standardisation mandate, the Secretary of State must inform the recognised standardisation body of the decision under paragraph 1 and may request the revision of the standard.”.

Extension and delay
7.  Any delay in relation to the time limits set in sections 1 to 5 in this Annex must be reported by the responsible TAB to the Secretary of State.
If an extension of the time limits for developing the UK Assessment Document can be justified, notably by the absence of a Secretary of State decision on the applicable system of assessment and verification of constancy of performance for the construction product or by the need to develop a new test method, the Secretary of State is to set an extended time limit.
Amendments and adoption of a UK Assessment Document
8.  The responsible TAB must communicate the draft UK Assessment Document to the manufacturer. The manufacturer has 15 working days to provide representations to the responsible TAB. Thereafter, the responsible TAB must:
(a)
consider any representations from the manufacturer with the working group referred to in section 2 and agree any changes to the draft UK Assessment Document with that group;
(b)
if applicable, inform the manufacturer as to how the manufacturer’s reactions have been taken into account;
(c)
adopt the draft UK Assessment Document; and
(d)
send a copy to the Secretary of State.
If, within 15 working days of receipt, the Secretary of State provides observations to the responsible TAB on the draft UK Assessment Document, the responsible TAB, after it and any relevant TABs have been given the opportunity to comment, must amend the draft accordingly and must send a copy of the adopted UK Assessment Document to the manufacturer and to the Secretary of State.
In this section, “working day” means any day other than:
(a)
Saturday or Sunday;
(b)
Christmas Day or Good Friday; or
(c)
a day which is a bank holiday under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971(7) in any part of the United Kingdom.
Final UK Assessment Document to be published
9.  As soon as the first UK Technical Assessment is issued by the responsible TAB on the basis of the adopted UK Assessment Document, the responsible TAB must adjust the UK Assessment Document, if appropriate, based on experiences gained and with the agreement of any relevant TABs.
The responsible TAB must adopt the final UK Assessment Document and must send a copy of it to the Secretary of State for publication of its reference.
As soon as the UK mark is affixed to the product, the responsible TAB must inform any relevant TABs and all the relevant TABs (including the responsible TAB) must keep the UK Assessment Document publicly available by electronic means.
Use of final UK Assessment Document
10.  Once the reference to the final UK Assessment Document is published by the Secretary of State under Article 22, it may be used by any relevant TAB for the purpose of issuing UK Technical Assessments.”.

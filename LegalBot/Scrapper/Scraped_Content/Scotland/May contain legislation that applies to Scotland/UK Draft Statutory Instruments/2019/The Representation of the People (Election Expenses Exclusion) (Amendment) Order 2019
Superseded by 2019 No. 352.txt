DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends Part 2 of Schedule 4A to the Representation of the People Act 1983 (“the Act”).
The Act sets out certain requirements in relation to “election expenses”, as defined in section 90ZA. These include a limitation on the permitted amount of such expenses, as set out in section 76 of the Act.
Part 2 of Schedule 4A to the Act sets out a list of matters which are “excluded” from being “election expenses” within the meaning of section 90ZA of the Act. Those matters are not subject to the requirements described above, including that as to the limitation on permitted amounts of expenses.
Article 2 adds to that list of matters expenditure by or on behalf of a disabled candidate that is reasonably attributable to the candidate’s disability. That expenditure must itself be reasonably incurred. This provision repeals the existing paragraph 7A of Schedule 4A (which in any event no longer has any force, because it ceased to have effect at the end of 30 June 2014).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

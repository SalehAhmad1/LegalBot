The Secretary of State makes these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972(1), as read with paragraph 1A(2) of Schedule 2 to that Act, and section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018(3).
The Secretary of State is designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in relation to public procurement(4).

In accordance with paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, a draft of this instrument has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.

REGULATION-MAKING POWERS
Modification of the 1958 List for the purposes of these Regulations
65A.  The Secretary of State may make regulations providing that the 1958 List is to be treated for the purposes of these Regulations as if it were changed in respects specified in the regulations.
Requirements relating to equipment for electronic receipt of documents
65B.  The Secretary of State may make regulations amending any or all of the technical details and characteristics of the equipment for electronic receipt set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of regulation 49(6).
General provisions about regulations under this Part
65C.—(1) Regulations under this Part are to be made by statutory instrument.
(2) A statutory instrument containing regulations under regulation 65A (whether alone or with other provision) may not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.
(3) Any other statutory instrument containing regulations under this Part is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.
(4) Regulations under this Part may make supplementary, incidental, transitional, transitory or saving provision.”.
(32) Before Schedule 1 insert the Schedule set out in the Schedule to these Regulations.
(33) Omit Schedule 3.
(1)
S.I. 2016/274, amended by [the Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019] (which amend regulation 16(1)(a) and (b) so that they mention the sums of £363,424 and £4,551,413 respectively, and insert a new regulation 16A under which those sums must be reviewed every two years and, if certain criteria are met, be changed by amending regulations made under that new regulation 16A); there are other amending instruments but none is relevant.
(2)
S.I. 2015/102, amended by [the Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019] (which insert paragraphs (5) to (7) into regulation 51 with effect from exit day); there are other amending instruments but none is relevant.Transitional and saving provision in relation to the amendments made by regulation 3
4.—(1) Subject to the other provisions of this regulation, the amendments made by regulation 3 apply prospectively even in relation to procurements which had commenced before exit day.
(2) But, subject to the following provisions of this regulation, an amendment made by regulation 3 does not apply to the extent that the provision amended refers or relates (directly or indirectly) to something which in fact occurred before exit day.
(3) Accordingly, for example, where, before exit day, a contract notice was published in the Official Journal after being sent for such publication in accordance with unamended regulations 17(2) and 48 of the 2011 Regulations (and the unamended definition of “contract notice” in regulation 3(1) of those Regulations), but exit day occurred before the sending of a contract award notice to the Official Journal in accordance with unamended regulations 32 and 48 of those Regulations in relation to that procurement—
(a)
the contract award notice is, on or after exit day, to be submitted for publication on the UK e-notification service in accordance with amended regulations 32 and 48 of the 2011 Regulations; but
(b)
the information to be included in that notice by virtue of amended regulation 32(1)(a) of the 2011 Regulations includes the date of the publication of the contract notice in the Official Journal because that publication occurred before exit day and, accordingly, the modification made by paragraph 5(b) of amended Schedule A1 (introduced by amended regulation 32(1)) is to be disregarded in relation to that publication.
(4) The amendments made by regulation 3 to the following provisions of the 2011 Regulations do not affect any procurement commenced before exit day—
(a)
in regulation 3(1), the definitions of “contractor”, “national of a member State”, “services provider” and “supplier”;
(b)
regulation 7;
(c)
regulation 16(1)(e);
(d)
regulations 23 to 27;
(e)
regulation 29;
(f)
regulation 39;
(g)
regulation 43(1)(e);
(h)
Schedule 3.
(5) The provisions saved by paragraph (4) are to be construed and have prospective effect, on and after exit day, as if the United Kingdom were still a member State.
Interpretation of this regulation
(6) For the purposes of this regulation, a procurement has been commenced before exit day if, before exit day—
(a)
a notice has been sent to the Official Journal in accordance with the 2011 Regulations in order to invite requests to be selected to tender for, to negotiate, or to participate in a competitive dialogue, in respect of a proposed contract or framework agreement;
(b)
the contracting authority has had published any form of advertisement seeking offers or expressions of interest in a proposed contract or framework agreement; or
(c)
the contracting authority has contacted any economic operator in order to—
(i)
seek expressions of interest or offers in respect of a proposed contract or framework agreement; or
(ii)
respond to an unsolicited expression of interest or offer received from that economic operator in relation to a proposed contract or framework agreement.
(7) For the purposes of this regulation, a procurement covers the whole of the procedures which stem from that commencement.
(8) Accordingly, for example, if a contract notice in relation to a proposed framework agreement has, before exit day, been sent as described in paragraph (6)(a), paragraph (4) applies to the award of any contracts based on that framework agreement regardless of whether the relevant specific procedure for the award of any such contract under regulation 20(7) to (9) of the 2011 Regulations had itself been commenced before exit day.
(9) Procedures taken for the purpose of modifying a contract or framework agreement are not to be regarded, for the purposes of paragraph (7), as stemming from the commencement of the procurement from which the award of that contract or framework agreement had itself stemmed.
(10) In this regulation—
“the 2011 Regulations” means the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011;

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1848) (“the 2011 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 makes amendments that take effect before the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. Regulation 2(2)(c) amends the definition of ‘member State’ to include Iceland and Norway. Regulation 2(2)(d) amends the definition of ‘military equipment’ to update a reference to the Common Military List of the European Union so that it refers to the current List (adopted on 26th February 2018) as amended from time to time. The other amendments made by regulation 2 remove references to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1564/2005 (which prescribed the form in which various notices were to be sent for publication in the Official Journal of the European Union) and make minor corrections or adjustments to the description of such notices and the information to be contained in them. That Commission Regulation was repealed in 2011 and its current equivalent is Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2015/1986 (OJ No L 296, 12.11.2015, p 1), which is directly applicable.
Regulation 3 is made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of the 2011 Regulations (as retained EU law) to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under paragraphs (a), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of section 8(2)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. Some of the amendments made by regulation 3 supersede amendments made by regulation 2.
Regulation 4 makes transitional and saving provision in relation to the amendments made by regulation 3.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

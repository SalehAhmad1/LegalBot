DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which are made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, amend the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 (“the 2010 Regulations”). The 2010 Regulations implement (in England and Wales and Scotland and, in relation to some provisions, also Northern Ireland) Council Directive 2008/104/EC of 19th November 2008 on temporary agency work (OJ L 327, 5.12.2008, p.9). This Directive establishes a general framework for protection of temporary agency workers.
The 2010 Regulations provide certain rights for temporary agency workers including in relation to basic working and employment conditions. Regulation 5 of those regulations provides a right for the agency worker to the same basic working and employment conditions as the agency worker would have been entitled to if they had been recruited directly by the hirer. Regulation 10 of the 2010 Regulations disapplies regulation 5, insofar as it relates to pay, where a permanent contract of employment is entered into between a temporary work agency and the agency worker. It provides a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in relation to the form and terms of the permanent contract and for a minimum amount of pay to be paid to the agency worker between assignments. Regulation 11 of the 2010 Regulations sets out how that minimum amount of pay is to be calculated.
Regulation 3 amends the 2010 Regulations by omitting regulation 10 and 11 and other provisions consequential on those regulations. This means that it will no longer be possible for regulation 5 of the 2010 Regulations to be disapplied in relation to pay as described above.
Regulation 4 requires a temporary work agency to give a written statement to the agency worker where the temporary work agency and the agency worker have entered a permanent contract of employment which is in effect when these Regulations come into force and has the effect that the agency worker does not have any entitlement to the rights conferred by regulation 5 of the 2010 Regulations insofar as they relate to pay. The written statement must inform the agency worker that, with effect from 6th April 2020, the agency worker is entitled to the rights relating to pay which are conferred by regulation 5 of the 2010 Regulations. It must be given by 30th April 2020. Where there is a breach of the requirement to give a written statement, the agency worker may bring a complaint to an employment tribunal, where the remedies available include compensation.
Regulation 5 provides the right not to be unfairly dismissed or subjected to a detriment for a reason relating to these Regulations.
Regulation 6 makes the Regulations applicable to Crown employment, the armed services, the House of Lords, the House of Commons and the police service, with certain qualifications.
Regulation 7 provides that the 2010 Regulations apply as if unamended to any complaints which relate to relevant breaches of the 2010 Regulations which occurred prior to these Regulations coming into force.
Regulation 9 requires the Secretary of State to review these Regulations at intervals not exceeding five years, as contemplated by section 28 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business and the voluntary sector is available from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy at 1 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0ET and is published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

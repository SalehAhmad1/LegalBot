DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Part 2 of Schedule 9 to the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/1154). That Part requires operators of materials facilities to notify the regulator if they receive waste material of 1,000 tonnes or more. Operators must sample the waste entering and leaving the facility and record and report the information to the regulator.
By virtue of these amendments (and in particular the definition of “waste material” in regulation 2(4)), the type of waste material to which the threshold for notification to the regulator applies will include waste material of a single type, rather than only material of two or more kinds mixed together.
Sampling requirements are amended, both in respect of waste material received at a materials facility (regulation 2(7)) and waste material leaving that facility (regulation 2(8)), to extend the types of material that is required to be identified, including types of packaging.
Regulation 2(9) amends the arrangements for record-keeping to reflect the new sampling requirements and to require the identification of the supplier of each batch of waste material received at the materials facility. Regulation 2(11) makes corresponding amendments to the arrangements for reporting to the regulator.
The period during which records are required to be kept for information recorded after the coming into force of these Regulations is extended from four to seven years (regulation 2(10)).
Information obtained by the regulator may be shared with the administrator for a scheme for producer responsibility for disposal costs (regulation 2(12)).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. As regards Wales, the Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations in relation to Wales. A copy can be obtained from the Waste Regulation Policy Team, Department for Climate Change, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

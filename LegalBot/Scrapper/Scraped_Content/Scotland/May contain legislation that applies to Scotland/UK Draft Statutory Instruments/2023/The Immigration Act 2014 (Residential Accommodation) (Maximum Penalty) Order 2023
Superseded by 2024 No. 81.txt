(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends sections 23(2) and 25(4) of the Immigration Act 2014 (c.22) so as to increase the maximum penalty which may be imposed by the Secretary of State under sections 23(1) and 25(3) of that Act from £3,000 to £20,000, in respect of a contravention by a landlord of section 22 of the Immigration Act 2014 (including in circumstances in which an agent of the landlord is responsible for the contravention under section 25 of that Act). However, the effect of the transitional provision is that the amendments will not apply to any contravention which occurred solely before the coming into force of this Order.

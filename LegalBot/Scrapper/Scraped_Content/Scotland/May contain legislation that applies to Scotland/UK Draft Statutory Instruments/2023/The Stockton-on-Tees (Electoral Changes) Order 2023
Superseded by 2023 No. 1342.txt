This Order gives effect to recommendations published by the Commission in September 2023, and revokes the Stockton-on-Tees (Electoral Changes) Order 2022 (S.I. 2022/966), which gave effect to recommendations published by the Commission in March 2022, and subsequently amended in May 2022 and July 2023.
Article 2 revokes S.I. 2022/966, but this is subject to provision stating that the tenure of any person elected as a councillor further to that Order is unaffected by its revocation.
Article 4 abolishes the existing electoral wards of the borough of Stockton-on-Tees and replaces them with 27 new ones for the purpose of elections held on or after the ordinary day of election of councillors in England in 2027.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into operation the revised code of practice (“the Code”) issued under paragraph 56(1) and (7) of Schedule 3 to the Counter-Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019 (c. 3) (“the 2019 Act”) in connection with the exercise of examining officers and review officers of functions conferred on them by Schedule 3 to the 2019 Act. The Code revises the preceding code of practice to take account of amendments made to paragraph 12(11) of Schedule 3 to the 2019 Act by section 29 of the National Security Act 2023 (c. 32) (“the 2023 Act”).
Paragraph 12(11) of Schedule 3 to the 2019 Act defines “protected material”. Section 29 of the 2023 Act amends paragraph 12(11) by removing “confidential business material” (material acquired in the course of trade that is confidential) from the definition of “protected material”. This amendment will serve to remove the requirement under paragraph 18(3) of Schedule 3 to the 2019 Act for the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to authorise retention of copies of confidential business material. This authorisation process for confidential business material will be replaced with a requirement for a Counter-Terrorism Police officer of at least the rank of superintendent to authorise the retention and use of such material, which requirement is provided for in the Code.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. A copy of the Code can be found publicly available online at www.gov.uk and hard copies can be obtained by writing to the Borders and Aviation Security Unit, Home Office, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.

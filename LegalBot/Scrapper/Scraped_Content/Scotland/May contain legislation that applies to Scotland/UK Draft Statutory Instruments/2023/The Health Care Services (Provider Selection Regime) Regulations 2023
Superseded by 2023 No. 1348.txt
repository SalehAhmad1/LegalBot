16.—(1) In these Regulations, a framework agreement is an agreement between one or more relevant authorities and one or more providers—
(a)
which establishes the terms based on which the provider will enter into one or more contracts for the provision of relevant health care services with a relevant authority in the period during which the framework agreement applies, and

17.—(1) A relevant authority may, during the term of a framework agreement, select further providers to be party to the framework agreement.
(2) A relevant authority must follow the Competitive Process to select such further providers, and references in Part 2 to concluding a framework agreement are to be treated as references to selecting further providers to be parties to a framework agreement when a relevant authority is following the Competitive Process to select such further providers.Contracts based on a framework agreement
18.—(1) A contract based on a framework agreement may only be awarded in accordance with this regulation.
(2) Contracts based on a framework agreement must not entail substantial modifications to the terms laid down in that framework agreement.
(3) Where a framework agreement is concluded with a single provider, a relevant authority may award a contract without a competition in accordance with that framework agreement.
(4) Where a framework agreement is concluded with more than one provider, a relevant authority may award a contract either without a competition or by following the Competitive Process, such choice being at the discretion of the relevant authority but must be made in accordance with the framework agreement.

which is a contract based on a framework agreement.
(3) The relevant authority must determine the basic selection criteria in accordance with Schedule 16.Exclusions
20.—(1) Subject to paragraph (5), a relevant authority must not award a contract to a provider, and may exclude a provider from a procurement process under these Regulations, where the relevant authority would be obliged to exclude the provider from participation in a procurement procedure under regulation 57 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015(1) (exclusion grounds) were the relevant authority the contracting authority and the provider an economic operator under that regulation.
(2) The relevant authority may exclude a provider from a procurement process under these Regulations where the relevant authority would be able, at its discretion, to exclude the provider from participation in a procurement procedure under regulation 57 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 were the relevant authority the contracting authority and the provider an economic operator under that regulation.
(3) The period during which the provider is excluded is the period which would apply if the exclusion were an exclusion under regulation 57(2) of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.
(4) A provider may provide evidence to the effect that measures taken by the provider are sufficient to demonstrate its reliability despite the existence of a relevant ground for exclusion.
(5) Where a provider provides such evidence and the relevant authority considers such measures to be sufficient, the relevant authority must not exclude the provider from the procurement process.
(6) Where a provider provides such evidence and the relevant authority considers such measures to be insufficient, the relevant authority must give the provider a statement of the reasons for that decision.

21.—(1) A relevant authority must take appropriate measures to effectively prevent, identify and remedy conflicts of interest arising in the conduct of procurement processes under these Regulations.
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)—
(a)
the concept of conflicts of interest includes any situation where an individual has, directly or indirectly, a financial, economic or other personal interest which might be perceived to compromise their impartiality and independence in the context of the procurement process, and
(b)
in particular, any such individual is required to recuse themselves from the decision-making process of that procurement process.
(3) Subject to paragraph (4), where the relevant authority is an integrated care board(1), an individual being both—
(a)
a member of that integrated care board, and
(b)
an employee, director, partner or otherwise holding a position within a provider,
does not in itself create a conflict or potential conflict of interest.
(4) Where the relevant authority is an integrated care board, and is following the Competitive Process to award a contract or conclude a framework agreement, an individual who is both—
(a)
a member of that integrated care board, and
(b)
an employee, director, partner or otherwise holding a position within a provider who is taking part in the procurement process,
is required to recuse themselves from the decision-making process.
(5) In this regulation, “member of an integrated care board” means the chair, the chief executive or an ordinary member of an integrated care board as specified in the constitution of the integrated care board as a member of that board.

the contract has been subject to a modification which cannot be made under regulation 13 without following a new procurement process;
(b)
the provider, at the time of the contract award, should have been excluded from the procurement process in accordance with regulation 20(1).
(2) The provisions referred to in paragraph (1) may address the basis on which the power is to be exercisable in those circumstances, for example by providing for notice of termination to be given and by addressing consequential matters that may arise from the termination.
(3) To the extent that a contract awarded under these Regulations does not contain provisions enabling the relevant authority to terminate the contract on any of the grounds mentioned in paragraph (1), a power for the relevant authority to do so on giving reasonable notice to the provider is an implied term of that contract.Advice
23.—(1) When making decisions in accordance with these Regulations, a relevant authority may seek or otherwise receive independent expert advice.
(2) The provision of information by a relevant authority for the purpose of paragraph (1)—
(a)
does not breach any obligation of confidence owed by the relevant authority, but
(b)
is subject to any express restriction on disclosure imposed by any enactment (other than a restriction which allows disclosure if authorised by an enactment).
(3) For the purposes of this regulation, “independent expert advice” means advice relating to the procurement of relevant health care services under these Regulations from a person with relevant expertise, qualifications or experience who is made available by, or endorsed by, NHS England or the Secretary of State for that purpose.

SCHEDULE 16
Basic selection criteria
Basic selection criteria: general principles
1.—(1) The basic selection criteria which must be met by a provider may relate to—
(a)
suitability to pursue a particular activity;
(b)
economic and financial standing;
(c)
technical and professional ability.
(2) A relevant authority may impose on providers as requirements only the criteria referred to in this Schedule.
(3) A relevant authority must limit any requirements to those that are appropriate to ensure that a provider has the legal and financial capacities and the technical and professional abilities to perform the contract to be awarded.
(4) All requirements must be related and proportionate to the subject-matter of the contract or framework agreement.
Authorisations or memberships
2.  In so far as a relevant authority determines that providers have to possess a particular authorisation or to be members of a particular organisation in order to be able to perform in their country of origin the service concerned, a relevant authority may require a provider to prove that they hold such authorisation or membership.
Economic and financial standing
3.—(1) With regard to economic and financial standing, a relevant authority may impose requirements ensuring that a provider possesses the necessary economic and financial capacity to perform the contract or perform contracts based on the framework agreement.
(2) In particular, a relevant authority may require that a provider—
(a)
has a certain minimum yearly turnover, including a certain minimum turnover in the services covered by the contract,
(b)
provides information on its annual accounts showing, for example, the ratios between assets and liabilities, and
(c)
has an appropriate level of professional risk indemnity insurance.
(3) The minimum yearly turnover that a provider is required to have must not exceed twice the estimated contract or framework agreement value unless the relevant authority is satisfied that a higher minimum is appropriate and proportionate to the subject-matter of the contract or framework agreement, for example where the nature of the subject-matter creates a special risk.
Technical and professional ability
4.—(1) With regard to technical and professional ability, a relevant authority may impose requirements ensuring that a provider possesses the necessary human and technical resources and experience to perform the contract, or contracts based on the framework agreement to an appropriate quality standard.
(2) A relevant authority may require, in particular, that a provider has a sufficient level of experience demonstrated by suitable references from contracts performed in the past.
(3) A relevant authority may assume that a provider does not possess the required professional abilities where the relevant authority has established that the provider has conflicting interests which may negatively affect the performance of the contract or contracts based on the framework agreement.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in respect of the procurement of relevant health care services for the purposes of the health service in England by relevant authorities. Relevant authorities are local authority bodies (combined authorities and local authorities) and NHS authorities (integrated care boards, NHS England, NHS foundation trusts or NHS trusts). Relevant health care services are health care services which fall within one or more of the common procurement vocabulary codes set out in Schedule 1. Regulation 3 also makes provision for the Regulations to apply to specified mixed procurements of relevant health care services with other goods or services.
Regulations 4 and 5 set out procurement principles and key criteria for decision-making when procuring such services under these Regulations.
Part 2 sets out the procurement processes. Regulation 6 sets out when each process applies. Regulations 7, 8 and 9 make provision for the three direct award processes, including the notices which must be published as part of those processes. Regulation 10 makes provision for the most suitable provider process and regulation 11 sets out the competitive process.
Regulations 12 to 15 set out further procedural rules. Regulation 12 makes provision in respect of the period (the standstill period) after a decision is made but before a contract is entered into or framework agreement concluded, in which aggrieved providers may make representations to the decision-makers and those representations are considered by the relevant authority. Regulation 13 makes provision for the modification of contracts and framework agreements during their term without following the processes otherwise provided under regulations 6 to 11. Regulation 14 sets out a special process for certain urgent awards or modifications and regulation 15 provides for notice of a decision to abandon a commenced procurement or a decision to repeat steps in a procurement.
Part 3 makes provision in respect of framework agreements; how they may be concluded; how additional provider parties may be selected and the processes to be followed when procuring under a framework agreement.
Part 4 makes provision for further requirements when procuring a contract or framework agreement for relevant health care services under these Regulations, including the basic selection criteria, the circumstances when a provider is excluded, how conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest must be managed and requirements to allow for contract termination.
Part 5 sets out requirements in respect of the records and summaries which must be kept and published and the monitoring requirements for relevant authorities. Part 5 also makes provision, in regulation 23, relating to advice from independent experts.
In Part 6, regulation 27 amends the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/102) so that provisions in those Regulations do not apply to contracts where these Regulations apply. Regulation 28 makes further amendments to S.I. 2015/102 consequential on the revocation of S.I. 2013/500 (that revocation is made by section 80(4) of the Health and Care Act 2022 (c. 31)). Regulation 29 makes transitional provision the effect of which is that these Regulations only apply to contract awards or the conclusion of framework agreements not commenced before the coming into force of these Regulations on 1st January 2024. Regulation 29 further provides that dynamic purchasing and similar systems may continue in operation. Regulation 29(2) and (3) make transitional provision in relation to modifications of contracts and framework agreements. Modifications made after 1st January 2024 will be made in accordance with these Regulations, regardless as to when the contract was awarded or framework agreement was concluded.

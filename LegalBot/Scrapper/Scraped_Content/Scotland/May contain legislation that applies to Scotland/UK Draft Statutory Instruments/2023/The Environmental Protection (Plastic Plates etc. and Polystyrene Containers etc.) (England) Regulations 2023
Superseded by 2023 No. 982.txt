(a)
serve a fixed monetary penalty notice, compliance notice, non-compliance penalty notice or stop notice; or
(b)
bring criminal proceedings.

Non-compliance penalties
Non-compliance penalties
24.—(1) If a person fails to comply with a compliance notice or a third party undertaking, the regulator may serve a notice on that person imposing a monetary penalty (a “non-compliance penalty”) in respect of the same offence, irrespective of whether a fixed monetary penalty was also imposed in respect of that offence.
(2) The amount of the penalty must be determined by the regulator, and must be a percentage of the costs of fulfilling the remaining requirements of the compliance notice or third party undertaking.
(3) The percentage must be determined by the regulator having regard to all the circumstances of the case and may, if appropriate, be 100%.
(4) The notice must include information as to—
(a)
the grounds for imposing the non-compliance penalty;
(b)
the amount to be paid;
(c)
how payment may be made;
(d)
the period in which payment must be made, which must not be less than 28 days;
(e)
the rights of appeal;
(f)
the consequences of failure to make payment in the specified period; and
(g)
any circumstances in which the regulator may reduce the amount of the penalty.
(5) If the requirements of the compliance notice are complied with or the third party undertaking is fulfilled before the time set for payment of the non-compliance penalty, the penalty is not payable.
Appeals against non-compliance penalties
25.—(1) The person on whom the notice imposing the non-compliance penalty is served may appeal against it.
(2) The grounds of appeal are—
(a)
that the decision to serve the notice was based on an error of fact;
(b)
that the decision was wrong in law;
(c)
that the decision was unfair or unreasonable;
(d)
that the amount of the penalty was unreasonable;
(e)
any other reason.

S.I. 2002/618. The definition of “medical device” in regulation 2 was amended by S.I. 2008/2936.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in relation to England, prohibit persons from supplying or offering to supply certain plastic or polystyrene items in the course of a business.
Part 2 prohibits the supply of single-use plastic plates, trays or bowls, balloon sticks and cutlery. It also prohibits the supply of single-use polystyrene food or drink containers and cups.
Breach of these prohibitions is an offence (regulations 3 to 5), subject to the mutual recognition principle in the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 where applicable. The United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 (Exclusions from Market Access Principles: Single-Use Plastics) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/857) exempt most of these items from the market access principles, but not trays and bowls.
A civil sanctions regime is also introduced to enable regulators to impose a range of civil sanctions (regulation 9 and Schedule 1). These are fixed monetary penalties, compliance notices, stop notices and enforcement undertakings. The Regulations make provision for the procedure relating to these sanctions and the available appeal mechanisms. Failure to comply with a stop notice is an offence (paragraph 16 of Schedule 1). All appeals relating to a civil sanction are to the First-tier Tribunal.
Regulations 8 and 10 provide for enforcement officers to have powers of entry to carry out the necessary investigations in order to determine whether an offence has been committed.
Regulation 11 provides for the publication of information on enforcement action taken by regulators. Regulation 12 provides that guidance relating to the use of civil sanctions must be prepared and consulted on, and specifies information to be included in such guidance. Regulation 13 contains provision for review of the Regulations.
Regulators are able to recover the costs of enforcement (paragraph 27 of Schedule 1) in the case of fixed monetary penalties, compliance notices and stop notices.
Part 6 and Schedule 2 make amendments to the Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017 to change the provisions for civil sanctions to enable regulators to impose fixed instead of variable monetary penalties. Schedule 3 makes amendments to the Environmental Protection (Plastic Straws, Cotton Buds and Stirrers) (England) Regulations 2020 for that purpose, and also amends the definition of “relevant device” in those Regulations in consequence of changes to the Medical Devices Regulations 2002.
A full impact assessment of the effect that these Regulations will have on the costs of business and the voluntary sectors is available from the Waste Team at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF, and is also available together with these Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

This Order amends Schedule 1 to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (“LASPO”) in relation to advice and assistance related to accommodation for asylum-seekers and failed asylum-seekers to reflect prospective changes to the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.
This Order also amends Schedule 1 to LASPO to provide for advice and assistance in relation to certain housing, debt, and welfare benefits issues where someone has already been determined to be eligible for legal aid in relation to a loss of home.
The Order also amends the Civil Legal Aid (Remuneration) Regulations 2013, which provide for the payment of remuneration to the providers of civil legal services, to specify the fees for the provision of these legal services.
The Order also amends the Civil Legal Aid (Procedure) Regulations 2012, which provide for the procedure for the making and withdrawal of determinations that an individual qualifies for civil legal aid.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Regulation (EU) 2016/1627 of the European Parliament and of the Council on a multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean (EUR 2016/1627) to implement requirements under the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (“the Convention”) to which the United Kingdom is a contracting party.
The Convention requires contracting parties to ensure that recreational fishing boats fishing for bluefin tuna in waters of the Convention area are subject to a system of authorisations.
These Regulations put in place a prohibition on all recreational fishing boats fishing for bluefin tuna within United Kingdom waters and a prohibition on recreational UK fishing boats fishing for bluefin tuna in other waters of the Convention area. These Regulations also put in place a legislative framework to enable the four UK fisheries authorities, if they wish, to establish permitting regimes in their waters (the Scottish Ministers in relation to the Scottish zone, the Welsh Ministers in relation to the Welsh zone, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland in relation to the Northern Ireland zone and the Marine Management Organisation in relation to the remainder of UK waters).
Where implemented, a permitting regime will allow eligible recreational UK fishing boats to apply for a permit to fish for bluefin tuna by rod and line on a catch and release basis in a defined area.
These Regulations also amend the Sea Fishing (Enforcement) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/849) to confer enforcement powers on Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Officers in relation to the prohibition on recreational fishing for bluefin tuna without a permit. Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Officers are appointed for inshore fisheries conservation districts in England only but the Sea Fishing (Enforcement) Regulations 2018 extend to Great Britain as Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Officers may exercise certain powers in Scotland or Wales.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen. A de minimis assessment has been produced and is published alongside the Explanatory Memorandum to these Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

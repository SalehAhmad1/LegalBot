DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Levelling-up and Regeneration Act 2023 (c. 55) provides for the establishment of combined county authorities for areas consisting of the whole area of a two-tier county council, plus a minimum of one or more whole areas of another two-tier county council, unitary county council or unitary district council in England. Combined county authorities are bodies corporate which may be given power to exercise specified functions.
These Regulations amend the Combined Authorities (Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Access to Information and Audit Committees) Order 2017 so it applies to combined county authority overview and scrutiny committees and audit committees as it does to combined authority overview and scrutiny committees and audit committees.
Regulation 12 makes provision for the payment of members of the overview and scrutiny committee and regulation 17 makes provision for the payment of members of the audit committee for both combined authorities and combined county authorities.
Part 3 makes provision to enable existing combined authorities to make payments to members of their overview and scrutiny committees.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument will have no impact on the costs of business and the voluntary sector.

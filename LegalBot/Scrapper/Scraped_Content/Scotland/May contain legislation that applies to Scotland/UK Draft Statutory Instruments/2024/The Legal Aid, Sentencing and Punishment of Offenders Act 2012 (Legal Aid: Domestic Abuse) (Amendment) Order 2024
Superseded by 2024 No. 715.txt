(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (c. 10) (“the Act”). It should be read in conjunction with the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (Legal Aid: Family and Domestic Abuse) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2023 (S.I. 2023/150) (“the 2023 Order”), articles 4(3) and 8 of which make provision for legal aid in relation to orders and proceedings under Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17) (“the DA Act”).
Article 2(2) inserts a new sub-paragraph (f) into paragraph 6 of Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the Act. This provides civil legal aid for advocacy in the Crown Court in relation to an appeal against a decision of the magistrates’ court to make, vary, or discharge a domestic abuse protection order (“DAPO”) under Part 3 of the DA Act. This provision of legal aid is only in relation to a DAPO which has been made or sought by the police under section 28 of the DA Act in the magistrates’ court. The provision of legal aid is for the person who is protected by and the person against whom the DAPO was made. Other proceedings in the Crown Court, in relation to DAPOs made under section 31 of the DA Act, will be criminal proceedings for which legal aid provision is made under the 2023 Order.
Article 2(3) inserts new sub-paragraph (ba) into paragraph 7 of Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the Act. This provides civil legal aid for advocacy in the magistrates’ court in relation to an application by the police for a DAPO and an application to vary or discharge such an order. The provision of legal aid is for the person who is protected by and the person against whom the DAPO has been sought or made. Other proceedings in the magistrates’ court in relation to DAPOs will be criminal proceedings under section 31 of the DA Act, for which legal aid provision is made under the 2023 Order.

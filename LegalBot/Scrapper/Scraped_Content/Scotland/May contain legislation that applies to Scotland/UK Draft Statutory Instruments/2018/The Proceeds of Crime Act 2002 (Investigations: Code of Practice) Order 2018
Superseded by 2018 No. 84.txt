(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into operation on 31st January 2018 a revised code of practice prepared by the Secretary of State under section 377 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (c. 29) (“the 2002 Act”) in relation to England and Wales and Northern Ireland. The revised code of practice relates to the exercise of functions under Chapter 2 of Part 8 of the 2002 Act by—
(a)
the Director General of the National Crime Agency,
(b)
other National Crime Agency officers,
(c)
officers of Revenue and Customs,
(d)
immigration officers
(e)
Financial Conduct Authority officers, and
(f)
in relation to England and Wales, accredited financial investigators and constables.
The functions in Chapter 2 of Part 8 of the 2002 Act concern the conduct by appropriate officers (defined in section 378 of the 2002 Act) of certain types of investigations which are authorised by the Act, concerned with the recovery of the proceeds of criminal conduct.
This Order revokes a previous Order made under section 377 of the 2002 Act.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it has no direct impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies. The code of practice provides guidance on the use of powers under POCA by bodies in the public sector, and incorporates existing best practice, but does not require any greater use of those powers which could result in an additional impact.

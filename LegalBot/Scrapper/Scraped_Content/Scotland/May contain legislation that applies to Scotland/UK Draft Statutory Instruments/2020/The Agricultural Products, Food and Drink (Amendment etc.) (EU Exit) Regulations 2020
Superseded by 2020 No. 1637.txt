PART 3
New Articles 14a and 14b
“Article 14a
Transitional provisions: relations between trade marks, designations of origin and geographical indications
1.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where, if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 13(1) in relation to a category A designation of origin or geographical indication.
2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where:
(a)
if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 13(1) in relation to a category B designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(b)
after the application for the trade mark is accepted but before the trade mark is registered:
(i)
in the case of a type 3B designation of origin or geographical indication:
(aa)
the international agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of column 2 of row 3 of the Types Table enters into force, and
(bb)
the entry into force of the international agreement is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered;
(ii)
in the case of any other category B designation of origin or geographical indication:
(aa)
the Secretary of State publishes an Article 52(4) approval notice relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(bb)
the Article 52(4) approval notice is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered.
3.  Where an application for a declaration of invalidity is made under the TMA (as applied by Article 14b(1) and modified by Article 14b(2)) in relation to the registration of a trade mark, the registration of the trade mark must be declared to be invalid, unless paragraph 4 applies, if:
(a)
the application to register the trade mark was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period,
(b)
the use of the trade mark contravenes, or will, if used, contravene, Article 13(1) in relation to a category B designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(c)
in the case of a type 2B, 4B, 5B or 6B designation of origin or geographical indication, the Secretary of State publishes an Article 52(4) approval notice relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication on or after the day on which the trade mark application is accepted.
4.  This paragraph applies where a column 5 date applies in relation to a category A or B designation of origin or geographical indication and, taking account of any priority claimed in respect of an application to register the trade mark referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3(a) (as relevant) and on the basis of the information available to the registrar, it appears to the registrar that the date of filing of the trade mark application is earlier than the column 5 date that applies to the relevant designation of origin or geographical indication.
5.  As regards paragraphs 1 and 2, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 3A, 4A or 5A designation of origin or geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication provides that an application for a trade mark must be refused, regardless of when that application is filed, if the trade mark, if registered, will contravene a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the designation of origin or geographical indication.
6.  As regards paragraph 3, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 3B, 4B or 5B designation of origin or geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication provides that the registration of a trade mark must be invalidated if, regardless of when the application that resulted in the registration of the trade mark is filed, the use of the trade mark contravenes a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the designation of origin or geographical indication.
7.  Where a designation of origin or geographical indication falls within the definition of more than one type of designation of origin or geographical indication in Article 3a, the column 5 date to be taken into account for the purpose of paragraph 4 is the earliest of the column 5 dates for the relevant types of designation of origin or geographical indication.
8.  In a case of a category A or B designation of origin or geographical indication that is not on Great Britain’s PDOs and PGIs Register at the time an assessment is carried out under paragraph 1, 2 or 3, the name of the designation of origin or geographical indication is to be treated, for the purpose of the assessment, as having a registered name in determining whether the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 13(1) in relation to that designation of origin or geographical indication.
9.  A trade mark that could be used in the United Kingdom under Article 14(2) of EU Regulation 1151/2012 immediately before IP completion day may continue to be used in Great Britain on and after IP completion day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would contravene Article 13(1) of this Regulation in Great Britain in relation to a designation of origin or geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
10.  Nothing in this Regulation prevents a trade mark that could be renewed in the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 14(2) of EU Regulation 1151/2012 immediately before IP completion day from being renewed after IP completion day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the renewed trade mark would contravene Article 13(1) in Great Britain in relation to a designation of origin or geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
11.  Where paragraph 9 or 10 applies to the use or renewal of a trade mark, this does not affect the use of:
(a)
a designation of origin or geographical indication entered on Great Britain’s PDOs and PGIs Register by the Secretary of State under Article 11(2);
(b)
an established protected designation of origin or an established protected geographical indication entered on Great Britain’s PDOs and PGIs Register pursuant to Article 16;
(c)
a designation of origin or geographical indication entered on Great Britain’s PDOs and PGIs Register following a decision by the Secretary of State to approve an application to register the designation of origin or geographical indication following an application submitted under Article 49.

PART 2
New Articles 102a and 102b
“Article 102a
Transitional provisions: relationship with trade marks
1.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where, if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 103(2) in relation to a category A designation of origin or geographical indication.
2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where:
(a)
if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 103(2) in relation to a category B designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(b)
after the application for the trade mark is accepted but before the trade mark is registered:
(i)
in the case of a type 3B designation of origin or geographical indication:
(aa)
the international agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of column 2 of row 3 of the Types Table enters into force, and
(bb)
the entry into force of the international agreement is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered;
(ii)
in the case of any other category B designation of origin or geographical indication:
(aa)
the Secretary of State publishes an Article 99 approval notice relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(bb)
the Article 99 approval notice is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered.
3.  Where an application for a declaration of invalidity is made under the TMA (as applied by Article 102b(1) and modified by Article 102b(2)) in relation to the registration of a trade mark, the registration of the trade mark must be declared to be invalid, unless paragraph 4 applies, if:
(a)
the application to register the trade mark was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period,
(b)
the use of the trade mark contravenes, or will, if used, contravene, Article 103(2) in relation to a category B designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(c)
in the case of a type 2B, 4B, 5B or 6B designation of origin or geographical indication, the Secretary of State publishes an Article 99 approval notice relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication on or after the time at which the trade mark application is accepted.
4.  This paragraph applies where a column 5 date applies in relation to a category A or B designation of origin or geographical indication and, taking account of any priority claimed in respect of an application to register a trade mark referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3(a) (as relevant) and on the basis of the information available to the registrar, it appears to the registrar that the date of filing of the trade mark application is earlier than the column 5 date that applies to the relevant designation of origin or geographical indication.
5.  As regards paragraphs 1 and 2, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 3A, 4A or 5A designation of origin or geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication provides that an application for a trade mark must be refused, regardless of when that application is filed, if the trade mark, if registered, will contravene a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the designation of origin or geographical indication.
6.  As regards paragraph 3, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 3B, 4B or 5B designation of origin or geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication provides that the registration of a trade mark must be invalidated if, regardless of when the application that resulted in the registration of the trade mark is filed, the use of the trade mark contravenes a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the designation of origin or geographical indication.
7.  Where a designation of origin or geographical indication falls within the definition of more than one type of designation of origin or geographical indication in Article 93a, the column 5 date to be taken into account for the purpose of paragraph 4 is the earliest of the column 5 dates for the relevant types of designation of origin or geographical indication.
8.  In a case of a category A or B designation of origin or geographical indication that is not on Great Britain’s PDOs and PGIs Register at the time an assessment is carried out under paragraph 1, 2 or 3, the designation of origin or geographical indication is to be treated, for the purpose of the assessment, as being a protected designation of origin or protected geographical indication, as relevant, in determining whether the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 103(2) in relation to that designation of origin or geographical indication.
9.  A trade mark that could be used in the United Kingdom under Article 102(2) of EU Regulation 1308/2013 immediately before IP completion day may continue to be used in Great Britain on and after IP completion day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would contravene Article 103(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 in Great Britain in relation to a designation of origin or geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
10.  Nothing in this Regulation prevents a trade mark that could be renewed in the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 102(2) of EU Regulation 1308/2013 immediately before IP completion day from being renewed after IP completion day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the renewed trade mark would contravene Article 103(2) in Great Britain in relation to a designation of origin or geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
11.  Where paragraph 9 or 10 applies to the use or renewal of a trade mark, this does not affect the use of:
(a)
a designation of origin or geographical indication entered on Great Britain’s PDOs and PGIs Register following a decision by the Secretary of State to approve an application made under Article 95(1A) or Article 3 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards applications for protection of designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional terms in the wine sector, the objection procedure, amendments to product specifications, the register of protected names, cancellation of protection and use of symbols, and of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards an appropriate system of checks;
(b)
a designation of origin or geographical indication entered on Great Britain’s PDOs and PGIs Register by the Secretary of State following a decision of the Secretary of State to approve an application to which Article 97a applies;

Transitional provisions: relationship with trade marks
1.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where, if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 20(2) in relation to a category A geographical indication.
2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where:
(a)
if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 20(2) in relation to a category B geographical indication, and
(b)
after the application for the trade mark is accepted but before the trade mark is registered:
(i)
in the case of a type 2B geographical indication:
(aa)
the international agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of column 2 of row 2 of the Types Table enters into force, and
(bb)
the entry into force of the international agreement is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered;
(ii)
in the case of a type 3B geographical indication:
(aa)
the Secretary of State publishes an Article 16 approval notice relating to the geographical indication, and
(bb)
the Article 16 approval notice is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered.
3.  Where an application for a declaration of invalidity is made under the TMA (as applied by Article 19b(1) and modified by Article 19b(2)) in relation to the registration of a trade mark, the registration of the trade mark must be declared to be invalid, unless paragraph 4 applies, if:
(a)
the application to register the trade mark was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period,
(b)
the use of the trade mark contravenes, or will, if used, contravene, Article 20(2) in relation to a category B geographical indication, and
(c)
in the case of a type 3B geographical indication, the Secretary of State publishes an Article 16 approval notice relating to the geographical indication on or after the day on which the trade mark application is accepted.
4.  This paragraph applies where a column 5 date applies in relation to a category A or B geographical indication and, taking account of any priority claimed in respect of an application to register the trade mark referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3(a) (as relevant) and on the basis of the information available to the registrar, it appears to the registrar that the date of filing of the trade mark application is earlier than the column 5 date that applies to the relevant category A or B geographical indication.
5.  As regards paragraphs 1 and 2, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2A or 3A geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the geographical indication provides that an application for a trade mark must be refused, regardless of when that application is filed, if the trade mark, if registered, will contravene a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the geographical indication.
6.  As regards paragraph 3, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2B or 3B geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the geographical indication provides that the registration of a trade mark must be invalidated if, regardless of when the application that resulted in the registration of the trade mark is filed, the use of the trade mark contravenes a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the geographical indication.
7.  In a case of a category A or B geographical indication that is not on Great Britain’s GIs Register at the time an assessment is carried out under paragraph 1, 2 or 3, the geographical indication is to be treated, for the purpose of the assessment, as being a geographical indication protected under this Regulation in determining whether the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 20(2) in relation to that geographical indication.
8.  A trade mark that could be used in the United Kingdom under Article 19(2) of EU Regulation 251/2014 immediately before IP completion day may continue to be used in Great Britain:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would contravene Article 20(2) of this Regulation in relation to a geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
9.  Nothing in this Regulation prevents a trade mark that could be renewed in the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 19(2) of EU Regulation 251/2014 immediately before IP completion day from being renewed after IP completion day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the renewed trade mark would contravene Article 20(2) in Great Britain in relation to a geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.

1a.  A UK temporary amendment application must be made to the Secretary of State.
1b.  The procedures laid down in Articles 94 and 97 to 99 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 do not apply to a UK temporary amendment application.
1c.

1d.  If a UK temporary amendment application is not made by the original (protection) applicant, the Secretary of State must give the original (protection) applicant the opportunity to make comments on the application if that applicant still exists.
1e.  A UK temporary amendment application must:
(a)
describe the amendment applied for,
(b)
be accompanied by a copy of the product specification and, where relevant, the single document, showing the proposed temporary amendment,
(c)
compare for each amendment:

1l.  The Secretary of State may, on an application by a group of producers or single applicant who made a UK temporary amendment application under paragraph 1a, as read with paragraph 1c, extend the period during which a relevant approved temporary amendment is to apply on one or more occasions if the Secretary of State considers that it is appropriate to do so having regard to the conditions prevailing at the time that decision is made.

PART 3
New Articles 32a and 32b
“Article 32a
Transitional provision: relationship with trade marks
1.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where, if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will not respect the definition in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the conditions of use in Article 113 of that Regulation in relation to a category A traditional term.
2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where:
(a)
if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will not respect the definition in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and conditions of use in Article 113 of that Regulation in relation to a category B traditional term, and
(b)
after the application for the trade mark is accepted but before the trade mark is registered:
(i)
in the case of a type 2B traditional term:
(aa)
the international agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of column 2 of row 2 of the Types Table enters into force, and
(bb)
the entry into force of the international agreement is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered;
(ii)
in the case of any other category B traditional term:
(aa)
the Secretary of State publishes an Article 115(2) approval notice relating to the traditional term, and
(bb)
the Article 115(2) approval notice is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered.
3.  Where an application for a declaration of invalidity is made under the TMA (as applied by Article 32b(1) and modified by Article 32b(2)) in relation to the registration of a trade mark, the registration of the trade mark must be declared to be invalid, unless paragraph 4 applies, if:
(a)
the application to register the trade mark was pending immediately before IP completion day or filed during the relevant period,
(b)
the use of the trade mark does not, or will not, if used, respect the definition in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and conditions of use in Article 113 of that Regulation in relation to a category B traditional term, and
(c)
in the case of a type 3B, 4B or 5B traditional term, the Secretary of State publishes an Article 115(2) approval notice relating to the traditional term on or after the day on which the trade mark application is accepted.
4.  This paragraph applies where a column 5 date applies in relation to a category A or B traditional term and, taking account of any priority claimed in respect of an application to register the trade mark referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3(a) (as relevant) and on the basis of the information available to the registrar, it appears to the registrar that the date of filing of the trade mark application is earlier than the column 5 date that applies to the relevant traditional term.
5.  As regards paragraphs 1 and 2, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2A, 3A or 4A traditional term where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the traditional term provides that an application for a trade mark must be refused, regardless of when that application is filed, if the trade mark, if registered, will contravene a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the traditional term.
6.  As regards paragraph 3, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2B, 3B or 4B traditional term where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the traditional term provides that the registration of a trade mark must be invalidated if, regardless of when the application that resulted in the registration of the trade mark is filed, the use of the trade mark contravenes a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the traditional term.
7.  Where a traditional term falls within the definition of more than one type of traditional term in Article 1b, the column 5 date to be taken into account for the purpose of paragraph 4 is the earliest of the column 5 dates for the relevant types of traditional term.
8.  In a case of a category A or B traditional term that is not on Great Britain’s Traditional Terms Register at the time an assessment is carried out under paragraph 1, 2 or 3, the traditional term is to be treated, for the purpose of the assessment, as being a protected traditional term in determining whether the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 113 in relation to that traditional term.
9.  A trade mark that could be used under Article 32(3) of EU Regulation 2019/33 in the United Kingdom immediately before IP completion day may continue to be used in Great Britain on and after IP completion day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would not respect the definition in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and conditions of use in Article 113 of that Regulation in relation to a traditional term registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
10.  Nothing in this Regulation prevents a trade mark that could be renewed in the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 32(3) of EU Regulation 2019/33 immediately before IP completion day from being renewed after IP completion day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the renewed trade mark would not respect the definition in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and conditions of use in Article 113 of that Regulation in relation to a traditional term registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
11.  Where paragraph 9 or 10 applies to the use or renewal of a trade mark, this does not affect the use of:
(a)
an established protected traditional term entered on Great Britain’s Traditional Terms Register pursuant to Article 39;
(b)
a traditional term entered on Great Britain’s Traditional Terms Register by the Secretary of State following a decision by the Secretary of State to approve an application to protect the traditional term submitted under Article 21 of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34;
(c)
a traditional term entered on Great Britain’s Traditional Terms Register by the Secretary of State under Article 25(3) of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (c), (d) and (e)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation relating to—
(a)
agricultural products and foodstuffs;
(b)
aromatised wines;
(c)
spirit drinks;
(d)
wine;
(e)
tribunal procedure rules concerning decisions relating to applications for the registration, amendment and cancellation of designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional specialities guaranteed for agricultural products and foodstuffs, geographical indications for aromatised wine and designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional terms for wines.
Part 2 amends the Quality Schemes (Agricultural Products and Foodstuffs) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1275) (“the 2018 Regulations”) to take account of changes relating to official controls affecting the 2018 Regulations made by Regulation (EU) 2017/625 on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (OJ No. L 95, 7.4.2017, p. 1).
Part 3 omits provisions in subordinate legislation that were included in that to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The legislation amended by that subordinate legislation, which would otherwise have come into force on IP completion day, either no longer applies or the amendments for that legislation are replaced by amendments in these Regulations which consolidate and update the previous amendments, taking account of the transition period.
Part 4 is divided into three Chapters and amends domestic legislation relating to agricultural products and foodstuffs, tribunal procedure rules, spirit drinks and wine. Chapter 1 makes amendments that extend to the United Kingdom, Chapter 2 make amendments that extend to Great Britain and Chapter 3 makes amendments that extend to Northern Ireland.
Part 5 and the Schedules amend retained direct EU legislation relating to agricultural products and foodstuffs, aromatised wine, spirit drinks and wine.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

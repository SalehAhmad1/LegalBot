This Order amends the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/1161) by expanding the ability to obtain leave to enter by passing through an automated gate to EEA and Swiss nationals. It also expands the circumstances in which leave to enter may be given orally to include those who seek to enter as an S2 Healthcare Visitor, and provides for visas issued to Service Providers from Switzerland to have effect as leave to enter on multiple occasions during their periods of validity.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

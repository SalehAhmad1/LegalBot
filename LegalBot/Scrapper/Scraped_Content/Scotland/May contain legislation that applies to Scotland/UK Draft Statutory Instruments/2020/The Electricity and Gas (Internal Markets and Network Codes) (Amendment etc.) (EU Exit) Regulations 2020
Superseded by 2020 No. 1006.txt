(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in order to address failures of retained direct EU legislation to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends S.I. 2019/532 to remove the definition of ‘regulatory authority’ in Regulation (EU) 2017/2195 as the same definition has been imported through Regulation (EU) 2019/943 as amended by these Regulations.
Regulation 3 amends S.I 2019/533 to disapply some definitions of Regulation (EU) 2019/943 as amended by these Regulations as they apply in Regulation (EU) 2017/1485. Regulation 3 also amends Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1485 so that the definitions in Regulation (EU) 2016/631, Regulation (EU) 2016/1388 and Regulation (EU) 2016/1447 will continue to apply. As a consequence of this change, the definitions expressly applied through paragraph 4(5) of Schedule 2 to S.I. 2019/533 have been removed.
Regulations 4, 5 and 6 introduce Schedules 1, 2 and 3 respectively, Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/631, Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/1388 and Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/1447. The amended Regulations are network codes relating to electricity and are tertiary legislation made by the European Commission.
Regulation 7, introduces Schedule 4, which amends Regulation (EU) 2019/943 on the internal market for electricity (recast).
Regulation 8 revokes Regulation (EU) 2019/942 establishing a European Union Agency for the Co-operation of Energy Regulators (recast).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

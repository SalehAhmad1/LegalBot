DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. They are also made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8C of that Act, to deal with matters arising out of or related to the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the EU withdrawal agreement.
These Regulations amend the Ozone-Depleting Substances and Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/583) for the purpose of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol, and to account for amendments to retained direct EU legislation that have been adopted at the EU level after those Regulations were made.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(b), (c), and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation relating to CO2 emission performance targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (vans).
They amend Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 setting CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011.
They amend Commission Implementing Decisions (EU) 2019/1119 and (EU) 2017/1153 made pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) 2017/1152 made pursuant to (EU) No 510/2011. They also amend Commission Implementing Decisions (EU) 2020/174, (EU) 2020/728, (EU) 2020/1102, (EU) 2020/1167, (EU) 2020/1222 and (EU) 2020/1232, all of which were made pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/631.
The Road Vehicle Emission Performance Standards (Cars and Vans) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/550) were made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in order to address failures of retained EU law - namely Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011 and regulations made pursuant to them - to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. As Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011 were repealed by Regulation (EU) 2019/631 with effect from 1 January 2020, this instrument amends S.I. 2019/550 to omit provisions relating to those repealed Regulations. It also amends S.I. 2019/550 to limit its application to England and Wales and Scotland, and to make certain amendments to regulations made pursuant to Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Education (Exemption from School Inspection) (England) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/1293), with the effect that any school within scope of those Regulations ceases to be an exempt school. An “exempt school” is a school which may not be subject to routine inspections under section 5(1)(a) of the Education Act 2005 (c. 18).
In consequence of the revocation of S.I 2012/1293, a new regulation 3B is inserted into the Education (School Inspection) (England) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/2038). Regulation 3B makes provision in respect of the first routine inspection of a former exempt school.
These Regulations also revoke the Further Education Institutions (Exemption from Inspection) (England) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/2576), with the effect that any institution within the scope of those Regulations is no longer exempt from routine inspection.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as there is no, or no significant, impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies and these Regulations have no or a minimal impact on the public sector.

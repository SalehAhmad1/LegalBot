Following a review under section 41(1) of the Tax Credits Act 2002(1) in the tax year 2019-20 of the amounts specified in section 41(2) of that Act, the Treasury have determined that Regulations should be made prescribing increases in those amounts.
Following a review of the sums specified in sections 150(1)(a)(i) and 150(1)(i) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992(2) in the tax year 2019-2020, the Treasury have determined that the general level of prices in Great Britain is greater at the end of the period under review than it was at the beginning. These Regulations make provision under section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and make corresponding provision for Northern Ireland in accordance with section 132(1) of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992(3).
A draft of these Regulations was laid before Parliament in accordance with section 66(1) and (2)(a) of the Tax Credits Act 2002, sections 150(2) and 190(1) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992, and section 166(10A)(4) of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992, and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.
The Treasury makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 7, 9, 11, 13, 65(1), and 67 of the Tax Credits Act 2002(5), sections 150(2), (5), (9) and (10)(a)(i) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992(6), and section 132(1) of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 and now exercisable by them(7).

Regulation 2 increases the maximum rate of different elements of working tax credit. It increases the basic element from £1,960 to £1,995, the disability element from £3,165 to £3,220, the 30 hour element from £810 to £825, the second adult element and the lone parent element from £2,010 to £2,045, and the severe disability element from £1,365 to £1,390.
Regulation 3 increases the maximum rate of different elements of child tax credit.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes changes to electoral arrangements for the borough of Bolton following recommendations made by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. The area of the borough remains unchanged.
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral wards of the borough of Bolton and replaces them with 20 new ones for the purpose of elections held on or after the ordinary day of election of councillors in England in 2023. It establishes the names and areas of the new electoral wards and the number of councillors for each.
Article 4 makes provision for a whole borough council election in 2023. Subsequently, the council will revert to the existing system of election by thirds. That article also provides for the order of retirement of councillors in 2024, 2026 and 2027 and the election of their replacements.

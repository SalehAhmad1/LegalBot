This Order makes provision replacing the temporary provision to identical effect made by the Competition Appeal Tribunal (Coronavirus) (Recording and Broadcasting) Order 2020 (which expires on 25th March 2022, being the date on which the Coronavirus Act 2020 expires(1)).

Where the conditions are satisfied, section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1925 (“the 1925 Act”) and section 9 of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 “(the 1981 Act”) do not have effect. Section 41 of the 1925 Act makes it an offence to film in court. Section 9 of the 1981 Act provides that it is a contempt of court to record sound in court except with the permission of the court.
Article 3 set out that the Order applies to all proceedings which take place in the Competition Appeal Tribunal in England and Wales. Article 4 sets out that section 41 of the 1925 Act and section 9 of the 1981 Act do not apply where the conditions of the Order have been satisfied.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to various United Kingdom and Scottish public procurement regulations for the purpose of implementing the Free Trade Agreement between Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway and the United Kingdom (“EEA EFTA Agreement”). This includes consequential amendments.
The amendments made by these Regulations implement the EEA EFTA Agreement generally, as well as a provision contained in the Agreement with respect to abnormally low tenders. To ensure contracting authorities take a consistent approach, the abnormally low tenders amendment has been made applicable to all procurements and economic operators as a consequential amendment to the EEA EFTA Agreement implementation under section 4(1)(c) of the Trade Act 2021.
These Regulations also make provision for transitional arrangements, in exercise of the power conferred by section 4(1)(d) of the Trade Act 2021.

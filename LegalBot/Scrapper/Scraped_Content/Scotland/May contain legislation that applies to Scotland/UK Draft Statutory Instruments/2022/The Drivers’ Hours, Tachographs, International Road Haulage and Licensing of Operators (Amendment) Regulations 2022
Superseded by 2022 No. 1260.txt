Regulation 5 amends the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Temporary Use in Great Britain) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/2186) to make consequential amendments in respect of exemptions to particular requirements of those Regulations relating to Northern Ireland goods vehicles and other goods vehicles whose operators are established outside of the United Kingdom and who hold international licences.

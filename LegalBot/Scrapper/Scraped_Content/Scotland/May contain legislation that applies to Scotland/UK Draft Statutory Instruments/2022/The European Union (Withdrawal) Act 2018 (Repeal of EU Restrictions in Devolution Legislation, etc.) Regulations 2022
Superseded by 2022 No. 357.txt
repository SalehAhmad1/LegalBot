(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision to repeal the limitations on devolved legislative and executive competence introduced by section 12 of and Part 1 of Schedule 3 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, and further provision in consequence of the repeals. The competence limitations, which were inserted as sections 30A and 57(4) to (15) of the Scotland Act 1998, sections 80(8) to (8L) and 109A of the Government of Wales Act 2006 and sections 6A and 24(3) to (15) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, provided that the devolved legislatures could not legislate, and the devolved administrations could not exercise functions, contrary to restrictions specified by UK government ministers in regulations. No such regulations have been made.
Part 2 repeals those limitations and makes further consequential amendments to the devolution settlements.
Part 3 makes consequential amendments to other legislation as a result of the repeals made by Part 2 of this instrument.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on business, charities or the public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

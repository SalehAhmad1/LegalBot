This instrument amends the Contracts for Difference (Allocation) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2011) and the Electricity Market Reform (General) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2013). Those Regulations form part of the legislative framework underpinning the Contracts for Difference (“CFD”) scheme under section 6 of the Energy Act 2013 (c. 32).

Under regulation 2(3), certain floating offshore wind generating stations will be required to produce a supply chain statement to take part in a CFD allocation round. Under regulation 2(4), applicants for flexible bids, in circumstances where there is a pending application (as set out in regulation 51 of the Contracts for Difference (Allocation) Regulations 2014), will be required to specify the “target commissioning window start date” instead of the “target commissioning date” in accordance with the allocation framework.
Regulation 3 amends the period during which supply chain statements have effect under regulation 11 of the Electricity Market Reform (General) Regulations 2014.
Regulation 4 contains transitional provisions.

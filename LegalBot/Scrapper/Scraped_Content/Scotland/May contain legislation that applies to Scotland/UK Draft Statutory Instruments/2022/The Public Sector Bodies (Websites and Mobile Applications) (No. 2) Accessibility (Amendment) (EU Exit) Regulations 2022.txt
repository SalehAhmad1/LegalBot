(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively, and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (and in particular, deficiencies under paragraph (g) of section 8(2) of that Act).
Regulation 3 omits definitions in Regulation 3 of The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 which are no longer appropriate.
Regulation 4 substitutes for the European accessibility standard (EN 301 549) the international web accessibility standard as the standard that a public sector body’s website or mobile application must meet to be presumed to be in conformity with the accessibility requirement.
Regulation 5 substitutes the requirement for the Minister for the Cabinet Office to submit a report to the European Commission on the outcome of their monitoring with a requirement for the Minister for the Cabinet Office to publish a report on the outcome of their monitoring.
Regulation 6 revokes three Commission Implementing Decisions of retained direct EU legislation relating to the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies for which alternative provision is made by these Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

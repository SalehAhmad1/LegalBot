(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2 of these Regulations corrects errors in the Judicial Pensions (Fee-Paid Judges) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/522) (the “2017 Regulations”) which created a pension scheme for fee-paid judges, by adding further judicial offices to the Schedule to the 2017 Regulations and making minor amendments. The limitation dates, where relevant, clarify the periods of service for which part-time judges holding these offices are eligible to receive a pension under the 2017 Regulations. The offices of Deputy Master of the Senior Courts and Deputy Insolvency and Companies Court Judge are included as these are the updated titles of offices already included in the scheme.
Part 3 of these Regulations makes provision about the scheme’s application to a holder of a new judicial office added to the 2017 Regulations by Part 2, in respect of relevant judicial service in those offices from 7th April 2000 until 31st March 2021, prior to admission to the scheme. The 2017 Regulations are modified so they can apply to these new members of the scheme for that period. In particular, provision is made about member pension contributions which would have been due in relation to pension benefits accruable before admission to the scheme, setting out how the amount of the contributions is to be calculated and how this is to be paid by the new member. The relevant contributions rates are set out in the Schedule to these Regulations.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Authority that the person or authority who made the grant has—
(i)
refused to accept repayment of the grant, or
(ii)
ceased to exist, or
(b)
paragraph (3) applies,
the Authority may register the applicant as a participant, but a grant funding deduction must be deducted from each periodic support payment in accordance with paragraphs (4) and (5).
(3) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
a grant originates from funds raised by the National Lottery, and
(b)
on or after 30th November 2021 but not later than 30th November 2025 installation of the equipment used to produce biomethane was completed and injection of biomethane produced by that applicant has commenced.
(4) A grant funding deduction for each quarter is calculated in accordance with the following formula—
where A is—
(a)
for the quarter in which the tariff start date falls, the figure that the Authority considers, based on all relevant information available to the Authority at the time, represents the total value of any grants from public funds to which paragraph (2) refers,
(b)
for any subsequent quarter that does not include 1st April of any year, the value of A in the previous quarter, and
(c)
for any subsequent quarter that includes 1st April of any year, the value of A in the previous quarter adjusted by the percentage increase or decrease in the consumer prices index for the previous calendar year, the resulting figure being rounded.
(5) Where a grant funding shortfall arises, the Authority must deduct from the periodic support payments (“P”) payable in the subsequent quarter and any quarter after the subsequent quarter, the grant funding deduction for that period together with such part of the grant funding shortfall as remains outstanding provided that the total amount so deducted does not exceed P.
(6) Where an application for registration in respect of additional biomethane is made under regulation 8—
(a)
a reference to a grant in paragraph (1) does not include a grant in respect of equipment used to produce that additional biomethane if the equipment is also used to produce original biomethane and a grant funding deduction is already being made in respect of the grant, and
(b)
paragraphs (2) to (4) do not apply in respect of the application.
(7) In this regulation—
“grant from public funds” means a grant made by a public authority or by any person distributing funds on behalf of a public authority,

which is being supplied, or is intended to be supplied, by the participant for injection at the same injection point as the biomethane in respect of which that participant was first registered,
(b)
“maximum additional capacity” means the volume of biomethane, expressed in cubic metres per year, which—
(i)
is additional biomethane, and
(ii)
is the maximum volume which a participant is entitled to supply for injection under the network entry agreement applicable to that additional biomethane.
(8) Where the Authority does not register a participant in respect of additional biomethane, it must notify the participant in writing that the application for registration in respect of additional biomethane has been rejected, giving reasons.Ongoing participant obligations: biomethane

(i)
solid biomass,
(ii)
solid waste,
(iii)
liquid waste, and
(b)
is not gas formed by the digestion of material in a landfill.
(2) Where waste is used as feedstock, the proportion of solid biomass contained in the waste must be a minimum of 10%.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2), the proportion of solid biomass is the energy content of the waste used as feedstock in a quarter, less the energy content of any fossil fuel(1) of which that waste is in part composed, expressed as a percentage of the energy content of that waste.
(4) Where solid biomass is used as feedstock, the participant may use solid biomass contaminated with fossil fuel only where the proportion of fossil fuel contamination does not exceed 10%, but such contaminated biomass may not be used unless the fossil fuel is present because—
(a)
the solid biomass has been subject to a process, the undertaking of which has caused the fossil fuel to be present in, on, or with the biomass even though that was not the object of the process, or
(b)
the fossil fuel is waste and was not added to the solid biomass with a view to its being used as a fuel.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4), the proportion of fossil fuel contamination is the energy content of the fossil fuel with which the solid biomass used in a quarter is contaminated, expressed as a percentage of the energy content of all feedstock (contaminated or otherwise) used in that quarter.
(6) A participant may use feedstock partly derived from fossil fuel only where the contribution of that fossil fuel to the energy content of the biogas that is produced from that feedstock does not exceed 10%.
(7) For the purposes of paragraph (6)—
(a)
the percentage of the energy content of biogas from the fossil fuel component of the feedstock is to be determined by the Authority for every quarter,
(b)
it is for the participant to provide, in such form as the Authority may require, evidence to demonstrate to the Authority’s satisfaction the percentage of the energy content of biogas from feedstock derived from fossil fuel, and
(c)
the percentage of the energy content of biogas from feedstock derived from fossil fuel is the energy content of the fossil fuel, expressed as a percentage of the energy content of the biogas used in that quarter to produce biomethane.
(8) Without prejudice to paragraph (7)(b), in determining the percentage of the energy content of biogas from feedstock derived from fossil fuel, the Authority may have regard to any information (whether or not produced to it by the participant) if, in its opinion, that information indicates the contribution of feedstock derived from fossil fuel to the energy content of the biogas.
(9) Where the Authority so requests, the participant must arrange—
(a)
for samples of the feedstock used (or to be used) to be taken by a person and analysed in a manner specified by the Authority, and
(b)
for the results of that analysis to be made available to the Authority in such form as the Authority may require.
(10) A participant must provide measurements in such format as the Authority may request which satisfy the Authority of all of the following—

(c)
the kWh of biomethane injected, together with supporting meter readings and calculations,
(d)
the kWhth of heat supplied to every anaerobic digester (other than heat contained in feedstock to produce biogas by anaerobic digestion) which made the biogas used in any quarter to produce biomethane for injection, and
(e)
any heat supplied to the biomethane production process.
(11) The measurements referred to in paragraph (10) may be estimated if the Authority has agreed in writing to an estimate being provided and to the way in which those estimates are to be calculated, provided that estimated measurements may only be used by a participant in relation to a maximum of six quarters.
(12) A participant must keep, and provide to the Authority upon request—
(a)
copies or details of agreements with third parties with whom the participant contracts to carry out any of the processes undertaken to turn the biogas into biomethane and to arrange for its injection, and
(b)
written evidence including invoices, receipts, contracts and such other information as the Authority may specify in relation to biogas purchased and feedstock used in the production of the biogas used to produce biomethane.
(13) A participant must ensure, in relation to digestate generated from every anaerobic digester, that they comply with the following requirements—
(a)
they use low emission spreading of digestate as defined in the Code of Good Agricultural Practice (COGAP) for Reducing Ammonia Emissions(2), or
(b)
where the participant contracts with another person to spread the digestate, that person complies with the relevant National Association of Agricultural Contractors standards or equivalent approved standards.
(14) Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the standards of a scheme or body in relation to the low emission spreading of digestate are equivalent to the relevant National Association of Agricultural Contractors standards mentioned in paragraph (13)(b), the Secretary of State may approve those standards for the purposes of paragraph (13)(b), and “equivalent approved standards” means standards so approved.
(15) A participant must—
(a)
keep, and provide to the Authority upon request, copies or details of arrangements made to spread digestate, and
(b)

tier 3: 1.56 pence per kWh.
(2) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), the initial tariff for a producer of biomethane, where the tariff start date is on or after 1st July 2022, is calculated in accordance with the formula—
where—
(a)
A is calculated in accordance with regulation 23, and
(b)
B is calculated in accordance with regulation 24 in relation to the assessment date immediately preceding the commencement of the quarter in which the tariff start date falls.

determine that the initial tariff remains unchanged.
(4) Where the initial tariff is increased or decreased as a result of a review described in paragraph (3), the initial tariff for a producer of biomethane where the tariff start date falls in the quarter beginning with the relevant date, is the initial tariff as so increased or decreased.Calculation of A
23.—(1) For the purposes of regulation 22(2), A is calculated as follows.
(2) Where the tariff start date is within any quarter beginning with 1st April, A is the relevant tariff which would have applied had the tariff start date fallen within the previous quarter (“the previous tariff”), adjusted by the percentage increase or decrease in the consumer prices index for the calendar year ending with 31st December immediately preceding the commencement of that quarter, the resulting figure being rounded.
(3) Where the tariff start date is within any quarter beginning with 1st July, 1st October or 1st January, A is the previous tariff.Calculation of B
24.—(1) For the purposes of regulation 22(2), B is calculated as follows.

S.I.2000/3042, revoked by S.I. 2014/3263.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in Great Britain, establish the Green Gas Support Scheme (“the Scheme”) which runs to 31st March 2041.
The Scheme is a renewable heat incentive scheme to facilitate and encourage the production of biomethane by anaerobic digestion, for injection into the gas grid. To that extent the Scheme replaces the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme, set out in the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/611), which closed to new applicants, with some exceptions, on 31st March 2021.
The Scheme supports the production of biomethane through a tariff based mechanism, and is funded by levy payments from fossil fuel suppliers.
The Regulations confer functions on the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (“the Authority”) in relation to the administration of the Scheme.
Part 2 (registration of participants and tariff guarantees) sets out the process by which a person who produces, or proposes to produce, biomethane for injection by anaerobic digestion can apply to be registered as a participant in the Scheme in relation to that production using specified equipment used to produce biomethane (that is, equipment including at least one anaerobic digester).
It provides that the person must first make an application to the Authority for a tariff guarantee. The effect of the tariff guarantee, if granted, is that once they are registered as a participant, they are entitled to be paid the initial tariff that applied on the date of their application for the tariff guarantee (rather than the initial tariff applicable on the date on which they become registered as a participant). It also provides for registered participants to apply to be registered in relation to additional biomethane capacity. The final date on which an applicant may be registered as a participant, and a participant can be registered in relation to additional biomethane, under the Scheme is 30th November 2025.
Part 3 (ongoing obligations on participants) sets out the obligations on participants, including in relation to: the feedstock from which the biomethane may be produced, the spreading of digestate generated from anaerobic digesters, the provision of information to the Authority, and the requirement to produce sustainable biomethane and to submit sustainability audit reports to the Authority.
Part 4 (changes affecting participants) provides for the Authority to review a participant’s registration following a change of circumstances. It also sets out the circumstances in which a person who starts to use equipment to produce biomethane, where that equipment was previously used by a registered participant, can become registered instead as the participant. And it provides for a participant to withdraw from the Scheme.
Part 5 (periodic support payments) sets out a participant’s entitlement to periodic support payments for 15 years from the date of their registration as a participant, and sets out the mechanisms by which initial and subsequent tariffs are calculated.
Part 6 (enforcement: participants) provides for the Authority to take action in the event that a participant fails to comply with an ongoing obligation, or was registered as a participant on the basis of information which was incorrect in a material particular. The Authority may: withhold or reduce a participant’s periodic support payments, correct the level of tariff being paid to a participant, revoke a participant’s registration, and recover overpayment of periodic support payments.
Part 7 (the levy) provides that licensed gas suppliers who are fossil fuel suppliers are “scheme suppliers” and liable to make levy payments to the Authority. But it provides that, where the Authority is satisfied that at least 95% of the gas supplied by them in a year was biomethane, a licensed gas supplier is not a scheme supplier in relation to that year, but is an exempt supplier. It sets out the mechanism by which a supplier must notify the Authority, before the start of a year, if they consider it is likely they will be an exempt supplier, and by which the Authority will determine, after the end of the year, whether the supplier is in fact exempt.
Part 7 requires scheme suppliers to lodge levy credit payments, or provide letters of credit, and to make quarterly levy payments in arrears. It provides for the Secretary of State to calculate a levy rate each year, based on factors including the projected scheme expenditure on periodic support payments for that year, and sets out the mechanism by which the Authority calculates the quarterly levy payments of each scheme supplier, based on the number of meter points served by them.
Part 8 (additional obligations on scheme suppliers) sets out the obligations on scheme suppliers to provide information to the Authority, including information about the number of meter points served by them.
Part 9 (changes affecting scheme suppliers) provides that, where a scheme supplier was a provisionally exempt supplier in relation to a year but is not subsequently determined to be an exempt supplier in relation to that year, they are required to make a backdated levy payment in relation to that year. It provides that where a supplier is confirmed to be an exempt supplier in relation to a year, but had not been a provisionally exempt supplier in relation to that year, the Authority must make a refund payment to them in relation to that year. And it provides for a scheme supplier to cease to be a scheme supplier (other than by virtue of being a provisionally exempt or exempt supplier) and for the payment to the Authority, or to the former scheme supplier, of any sums due as a result.
Part 10 (compliance and enforcement: scheme suppliers) provides for the Authority to serve enforcement notices where it is satisfied that a scheme supplier has failed to make payments under the Regulations, to recover sums due together with interest. It makes provision for the Authority to draw down a scheme supplier’s credit cover to settle the amount outstanding. And, where the amount of a scheme supplier’s credit cover is insufficient to cover the amount outstanding, it provides for the Authority to carry out a mutualisation process, whereby the outstanding amount is recovered from the other scheme suppliers. It also provides for the Authority to serve penalty notices where a scheme supplier is in breach of an obligation under the Regulations, and for unpaid amounts to be recovered as a civil debt. It provides for the Authority to maintain a public register of suppliers’ default, and for scheme suppliers to appeal to the High Court in England and Wales, and the Court of Session in Scotland, against the imposition of an enforcement notice or a penalty notice.
Part 11 (administrative functions of the Authority) enables any applicant, participant or former participant to apply to the Authority for a review of any decision affecting them. It requires/enables the Authority to publish guidance in relation to the administration of the Scheme, and requires the Authority to report on the operation of the Scheme to the Secretary of State.

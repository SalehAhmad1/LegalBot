DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Part 1 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 (c. 28) (“the 2007 Act”) provides for structural and boundary changes in relation to local government areas in England. Structural change is a change from two-tier local government (a county council and district councils) in an area to a single tier of local government. There is a single tier of local government for an area if there is either a county council and no district councils for that area, or a district council and no county council for that area (section 1(2) of the 2007 Act).
The Secretary of State may by order implement (with or without modification) a proposal received for a single tier of local government (section 7 of the 2007 Act). This Order makes provision which is incidental, consequential and supplementary to the implementation by order of structural change in Northamptonshire (the Northamptonshire (Structural Changes) Order 2020 (S.I. 2020/156)).
Articles 2 and 3 make consequential amendments to the Lieutenancies Act 1997 (c.23) and the Sheriffs Act 1887 (c.55) to outline in the relevant schedules that reference to Northamptonshire includes the local government areas of North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire.
Articles 4 and 5 make provision about vesting the local government pension fund that is maintained by Northamptonshire County Council in the new West Northamptonshire Council and make consequential amendments to the Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/2356).
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument will have no impact on the costs of business and the voluntary sector. The impact on the public sector is a simplification to the system of local government in Northamptonshire.

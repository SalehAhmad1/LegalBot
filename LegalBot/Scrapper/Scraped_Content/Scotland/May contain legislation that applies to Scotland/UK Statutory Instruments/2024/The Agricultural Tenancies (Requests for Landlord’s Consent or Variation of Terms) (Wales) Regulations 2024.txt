Part 1 contains introductory provisions.
Part 2 provides for a tenant to refer a request to arbitration where a landlord’s consent or a variation of the terms of a contract of tenancy of a farm business tenancy under the 1995 Act is required either to enable a tenant to request or apply for relevant financial support under the Agriculture (Wales) Act 2023 (asc 4) as defined in regulation 2 or in order to meet a statutory duty.
Regulation 3 sets out the scope of requests that may be made under this Part, the requirements that must be met before a request can be made and the information that must be included in a formal notice to the landlord that a request for arbitration is being made.
Regulation 4 provides that when considering a request, an arbitrator may order the landlord to comply with the request, in full or in part, or make any award or determination they consider reasonable and just between the landlord and tenant.
Regulation 4(5) provides that any award or determination takes effect as if the terms and provisions in it were contained in an agreement in writing entered into by the landlord and tenant by way of variation of the agreement previously in place in respect of the tenancy from the making of the award or determination or at any specified later date.
Regulation 5 provides for a review of these Regulations by 13 June 2031 and at intervals not exceeding 5 years thereafter.

At 11.03 a.m. on 22 December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by:
(a)
paragraph 11A(1) of Schedule 2 to the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Wales) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/2379 (W. 252)) (“the 2011 Regulations”); and
(b)
paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 makes amendments to Schedule 5 of the 2011 Regulations to ensure alignment with Article 56A of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls and other official activities, as inserted for the purposes mentioned in paragraph 3 of Annex 6, and as amended by regulation 2 of the Official Controls (Extension of Transitional Periods) (England and Wales) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/1443).
Regulation 2 also amends Schedule 5 of the 2011 Regulations to enable enforcement powers to remain available during the extended transitional staging period other than at border control posts in respect of animals and animal products in Wales.
Regulation 3 amends the Meat Preparations (Amendment and Transitory Modification) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/1 (W. 1)) to extend the temporary suspension of the requirement for meat preparations to be deep frozen where they are imported into Wales from EEA member States, the Faroe Islands, Greenland or Switzerland, bringing it into line with the extended transitional staging period. This extension is until midnight on 30 June 2022. This date had previously been amended by the Meat Preparations (Amendment and Transitory Modification) (Wales) (EU Exit) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/376 (W. 117)) and the Meat Preparations (Amendment and Transitory Modification) (Wales) (EU Exit) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/977 (W. 231)).

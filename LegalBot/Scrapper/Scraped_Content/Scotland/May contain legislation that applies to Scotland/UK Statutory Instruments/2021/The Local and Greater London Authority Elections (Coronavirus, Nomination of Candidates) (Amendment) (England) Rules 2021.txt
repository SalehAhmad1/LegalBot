(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Local Elections (Principal Areas) (England and Wales) Rules 2006 (S.I. 2006/3304) and the Greater London Authority Elections Rules 2007 (S.I. 2007/3541). The amendments reduce the number of subscribing electors that are required on a candidate nomination form respectively for local elections and for the London mayoral elections. This is to reduce the amount of person to person contact that may be needed as part of the nomination process, in order to reduce the risk of exposure to and transmission of the Coronavirus.
Rule 2 provides for the expiry of these amendments at the end of 28th February 2022, except in respect of elections which have been commenced (by the issuing of the notice of election) on or before that date but where the poll for that election will take place on or after that date. The prior rules, which are amended by these rules, will apply to elections in relation to which a notice is issued after 28th February 2022.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on business, charities or the public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

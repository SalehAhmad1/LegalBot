Section 336A was inserted by section 10(4) of the Criminal Finances Act 2017 (c. 22).EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Investigations in different parts of the United Kingdom) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/425) (the “2003 Order”).
The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (c. 29) (the “2002 Act”) provides for orders to be made and warrants to be issued under Part 8 to support various types of investigation (see section 341). The 2003 Order makes provision for the enforcement of orders made and warrants issued in one part of the United Kingdom in another part (where this is not governed by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (c. 27) (the “1982 Act”)).
The 2002 Act was amended by the Criminal Finances Act 2017 (c. 22) (the “2017 Act”) in three relevant respects—
(1) The power to make production orders and issue search and seizure warrants in Part 8 of the 2002 Act was extended to two new types of investigation. These are ‘detained property investigations’ and ‘frozen funds investigations’. These investigations relate to new powers to forfeit, respectively, various listed types of tangible property and funds in bank accounts (2002 Act, Part 5, Chapters 3A and 3B, as inserted by the 2017 Act, sections 15 and 16).
(2) The power to make disclosure orders under Part 8 of the 2002 Act was extended to money laundering investigations (2017 Act, sections 7 and 8).
(3) A power to extend moratorium periods in relation to money laundering investigations was inserted in Part 7 of the 2002 Act (2017 Act, section 10).
These changes were commenced for England and Wales and Scotland in 2018. The necessary changes to the 2003 Order were made by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Investigations in different parts of the United Kingdom) (Amendment) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/1280).
This Order makes the further amendments necessary in connection with the commencement of these provisions for Northern Ireland.
Paragraph 3 of the Schedule amends the definitions in article 2 of the 2003 Order to provide for the enforcement of orders and execution of warrants for detained property investigations and frozen funds investigations (in sub-paragraphs (3) to (5), (8) and (9)). That is, for Northern Ireland orders and warrants to be enforced or executed in England and Wales and Scotland and for English or Welsh orders and warrants to be enforced or executed in Northern Ireland. (No provision is needed for Northern Ireland in respect of Scottish orders and warrants in this context because of section 18(2)(g) of the 1982 Act.)
Paragraph 3 of the Schedule also amends article 2 definitions to make the changes necessary as a result of disclosure orders being extended to money laundering investigations (in sub-paragraphs (2), (6) and (10)).
The remaining provisions of paragraph 3, together with paragraphs 4 to 6, of the Schedule make the changes necessary to provide for moratorium extension orders made in Northern Ireland to be enforced in England and Wales and Scotland and such orders made in England and Wales or Scotland to be enforced in Northern Ireland.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

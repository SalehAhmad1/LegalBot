Under section 25B of the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006, a Local Health Board or NHS Trust which provides nursing services in relation to those clinical settings specified in subsection 25B(3), namely adult acute medical inpatient wards and adult acute surgical inpatient wards, is under a duty to calculate, and take steps to maintain, nurse staffing levels, and to inform patients of those nurse staffing levels.
These Regulations extend the situations to which the duties under section 25B of the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 apply to include paediatric inpatient wards.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations in Wales.

15 July 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (Wales) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1818 (W. 261)) (“the 2015 Regulations”) in light of amendments to section 83 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 (anaw 4) (“the 2014 Act”) made by section 16 of the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 (anaw 2). Regulation 6 removes the requirement in the 2015 Regulations that a care and support plan include a personal education plan, because that requirement has been inserted into section 83 of the 2014 Act. Regulation 5 prescribes the categories of looked after children for whom no personal education plan is to be prepared as part of their care and support plan. The categories prescribed are those for whom a personal education plan was not required by the 2015 Regulations. The matters that must be included in a personal education plan are unchanged.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely cost and benefit of complying with these Regulations.

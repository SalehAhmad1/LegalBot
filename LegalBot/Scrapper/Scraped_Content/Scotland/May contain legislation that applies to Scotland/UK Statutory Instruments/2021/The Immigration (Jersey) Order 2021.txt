(2) A deportation order against a person may at any time be revoked by a further order of the Minister, and shall cease to have effect if he becomes a British citizen.
(3) A deportation order shall not be made against a person as belonging to the family of another person if more than eight weeks have elapsed since the other person left Jersey after the making of the deportation order against him; and a deportation order made against a person on that ground shall cease to have effect if he ceases to belong to the family of the other person, or if the deportation order made against the other person ceases to have effect.

(a) where that other person is a man, his wife or civil partner, and his or her children under the age of eighteen; and
(b) where that other person is a woman, her husband or civil partner, and her or his children under the age of eighteen,
and for purposes of this subsection an adopted child, whether legally adopted or not, may be treated as the child of the adopter and, if legally adopted, shall be regarded as the child only of the adopter; an illegitimate child (subject to the foregoing rule as to adoptions) shall be regarded as the child of the mother; and “wife” includes each of two or more wives.

Recommendations by court for deportation.
6.—(1) Where under section 3(6) above a person convicted of an offence is liable to deportation on the recommendation of a court, he may be recommended for deportation by any court having power to sentence him for the offence unless the court commits him to be sentenced or further dealt with for that offence by another court.
(2) A court shall not recommend a person for deportation unless he has been given not less than seven days’ notice in writing stating that a person is not liable to deportation if he is a British citizen, describing the persons who are British citizens and stating (so far as material) the effect of section 3(8) above and section 7 below; but the powers of a court to adjourn shall include power to adjourn, after convicting an offender, for the purpose of enabling a notice to be given to him under this subsection or, if a notice was so given to him less than seven days previously, for the purpose of enabling the necessary seven days to elapse.

(b) the question whether an offence is one for which a person is punishable with imprisonment shall be determined without regard to any enactment restricting the imprisonment of young offenders or persons who have not previously been sentenced to imprisonment;
and for purposes of deportation a person who on being charged with an offence is found to have committed it shall, notwithstanding any enactment to the contrary and notwithstanding that the court does not proceed to conviction, be regarded as a person convicted of the offence, and references to conviction shall be construed accordingly.
(4) Notwithstanding any rule of practice restricting the matters which ought to be taken into account in dealing with an offender who is sentenced to imprisonment, a recommendation for deportation may be made in respect of an offender who is sentenced to imprisonment for life.
(5) Where a court recommends or purports to recommend a person for deportation, the validity of the recommendation shall not be called in question except on an appeal against the recommendation or against the conviction on which it is made; but the recommendation shall be treated as a sentence for the purpose of any enactment providing an appeal against sentence.
(6) A deportation order shall not be made on the recommendation of a court so long as an appeal or further appeal is pending against the recommendation or against the conviction on which it was made; and for this purpose an appeal or further appeal shall be treated as pending (where one is competent but has not been brought) until the expiration of the time for bringing that appeal.

(4) In determining, for the purposes of this section, whether a particular system is effective, regard is to be had to the code of practice issued by the Minister under section 33.

Commencement Information

Sch. 5A Pt. 5A comes into force in accordance with art. 1(1)
Application of this Part.
117A.—(1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is required to determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts—
(a) breaches a person’s right to respect for private and family life under Article 8, and
(b) as a result would be unlawful under Article 7 of the Human Rights (Jersey) Law 2000.
(2) In considering the public interest question, the court or tribunal must (in particular) have regard—
(a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section 117B, and
(b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign criminals, to the considerations listed in section 117C.
(3) In subsection (2), “the public interest question” means the question of whether an interference with a person’s right to respect for private and family life is justified under Article 8(2).
Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases.
117B.—(1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public interest.
(2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the economic well-being of Jersey, that persons who seek to enter or remain in Jersey are able to speak English or French, because persons who can speak English or French—
(a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
(b) are better able to integrate into society.
(3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of the economic well-being of Jersey, that persons who seek to enter or remain in Jersey are financially independent, because such persons—
(a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
(b) are better able to integrate into society.
(4) Little weight should be given to—
(a) a private life, or
(b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
that is established by a person at a time when the person is in Jersey unlawfully.
(5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a person at a time when the person’s immigration status is precarious.
(6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the public interest does not require the person’s removal where—
(a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and
(b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave Jersey.
Article 8: additional considerations in cases involving foreign criminals.
117C.—(1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
(2) The more serious the offence committed by a foreign criminal, the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
(3) In the case of a foreign criminal (“C”) who has not been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or more, the public interest requires C’s deportation unless Exception 1 or Exception 2 applies.
(4) Exception 1 applies where—
(a) C has been lawfully resident in Jersey for most of C’s life,
(b) C is socially and culturally integrated in Jersey, and
(c) there would be very significant obstacles to C’s integration into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.
(5) Exception 2 applies where C has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and the effect of C’s deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.
(6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest requires deportation unless there are very compelling circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.
(7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are to be taken into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that the reason for the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has been convicted.
Interpretation of this Part.
117D.—(1) In this Part—

(4) In this Part, references to a person who has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of a certain length of time—
(a) do not include a person who has received a suspended sentence (unless a court subsequently orders that the sentence or any part of it (of whatever length) is to take effect);
(b) do not include a person who has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of that length of time only by virtue of being sentenced to consecutive sentences amounting in aggregate to that length of time;

Provision as extended to Jersey
PART 1
TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL
SECTION 1
POWERS TO SEIZE TRAVEL DOCUMENTS
Seizure of passports etc from persons suspected of involvement in terrorism.
1. Schedule 1 makes provision for the seizure and temporary retention of travel documents where a person is suspected of intending to leave Jersey in connection with terrorism-related activity.
CHAPTER 2
TEMPORARY EXCLUSION FROM JERSEY
Imposition of temporary exclusion orders
Temporary exclusion orders.
2.—(1) A “temporary exclusion order” is an order which requires an individual not to return to Jersey unless –
(a) the return is in accordance with a permit to return issued by the Minister before the individual began the return, or
(b) the return is the result of the individual’s deportation to Jersey.
(2) The Minister may impose a temporary exclusion order on an individual if conditions A to E are met.
(3) Condition A is that the Minister reasonably suspects that the individual is, or has been involved in terrorism-related activity outside the British Islands.
(4) Condition B is that the Minister reasonably considers that it is necessary, for purposes connected with protecting members of the public in Jersey from a risk of terrorism, for a temporary exclusion order to be imposed on the individual.
(5) Condition C is that the Minister reasonably considers that the individual is outside the British Islands.
(6) Condition D is that the individual has the right of abode in Jersey.
(7) Condition E is that –
(a) the Royal Court gives the Minister permission under section 3, or
(b) the Minister reasonably considers that the urgency of the case requires a temporary exclusion order to be imposed without obtaining such permission.
(8) During the period that a temporary exclusion order is in force, the Minister must keep under review whether condition B is met.
Temporary exclusion orders: prior permission of the Royal Court.
3.—(1) This section applies if the Minister –
(a) makes the relevant decisions in relation to an individual, and
(b) makes an application to the Royal Court for permission to impose a temporary exclusion order on the individual.
(2) The function of the Royal Court on the application is to determine whether the relevant decisions of the Minister are obviously flawed.
(3) The Royal Court may consider the application –
(a) in the absence of the individual,
(b) without the individual having been notified of the application, and
(c) without the individual having been given an opportunity (if the individual was aware of the application) of making any representations to the Royal Court.
(4) But that does not limit the matters about which rules of court may be made.
(5) In determining the application, the Royal Court must apply the principles applicable on an application for judicial review.
(6) In a case where the Royal Court determines that any of the relevant decisions of the Minister is obviously flawed, the Royal Court may not give permission under this section.
(7) In any other case, the Royal Court must give permission under this section.
(8) Schedule 2 makes provision for references to the Royal Court etc where temporary exclusion orders are imposed in cases of urgency.
(9) Only the Minister may appeal against a determination of the Royal Court under –
(a) this section, or
(b) Schedule 2;
and such an appeal may only be made on a question of law.
(10) In this section “the relevant decisions” means the decisions that the following conditions are met –
(a) condition A;
(b) condition B;
(c) condition C;
(d) condition D.
Temporary exclusion orders: supplementary provision.
4.—(1) The Minister must give notice of the imposition of a temporary exclusion order to the individual on whom it is imposed (the “excluded individual”).
(2) Notice of the imposition of a temporary exclusion order must include an explanation of the procedure for making an application under section 6 for a permit to return.
(3) A temporary exclusion order –
(a) comes into force when notice of its imposition is given; and
(b) is in force for the period of two years (unless revoked or otherwise brought to an end earlier).
(4) The Minister may revoke a temporary exclusion order at any time.
(5) The Minister must give notice of the revocation of a temporary exclusion order to the excluded individual.
(6) If a temporary exclusion order is revoked, it ceases to be in force when notice of its revocation is given.
(7) The validity of a temporary exclusion order is not affected by the excluded individual –
(a) returning to Jersey, or
(b) departing from Jersey.
(8) The imposition of a temporary exclusion order does not prevent a further temporary exclusion order from being imposed on the excluded individual (including in a case where an order ceases to be in force at the expiry of its two year duration).
(9) At the time when a temporary exclusion order comes into force, any British passport held by the excluded individual is invalidated.
(10) During the period when a temporary exclusion order is in force, the issue of a British passport to the excluded individual while he or she is outside the British Islands is not valid.
(11) In this section “British passport” means a passport, or other document which enables or facilitates travel from one state to another (except a permit to return), that has been –
(a) issued by or for Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, and
(b) issued in respect of a person’s status as a British citizen.
Permit to return
Permit to return.
5.—(1) A “permit to return” is a document giving an individual (who is subject to a temporary exclusion order) permission to return to Jersey.
(2) The permission may be made subject to a requirement that the individual comply with conditions specified in the permit to return.
(3) The individual’s failure to comply with a specified condition has the effect of invalidating the permit to return.
(4) A permit to return must state –
(a) the time at which, or period of time during which, the individual is permitted to arrive on return to Jersey;
(b) the manner in which the individual is permitted to return to Jersey; and
(c) the place where the individual is permitted to arrive on return to Jersey.
(5) Provision made under subsection (4)(a) or (c) may, in particular, be framed by reference to the arrival in Jersey of a specific flight, sailing or other transport service.
(6) Provision made under subsection (4)(b) may, in particular, state –
(a) a route,
(b) a method of transport,
(c) an airline, shipping line or other passenger carrier, or
(d) a flight, sailing or other transport service,
which the individual is permitted to use to return to Jersey.
(7) The Minister may not issue a permit to return except in accordance with section 6 or 7.
(8) It is for the Minister to decide the terms of a permit to return (but this is subject to section 6(3)).
Issue of permit to return: application by individual.
6.—(1) If an individual applies to the Minister for a permit to return, the Minister must issue a permit within a reasonable period after the application is made.
(2) But the Minister may refuse to issue the permit if –
(a) the Minister requires the individual to attend an interview with a police officer or immigration officer at a time and a place specified by the Minister, and
(b) the individual fails to attend the interview.
(3) Where a permit to return is issued under this section, the relevant return time must fall within a reasonable period after the application is made.
(4) An application is not valid unless it is made in accordance with the procedure for applications specified by the Minister.
(5) In this section –
“application” means an application made by an individual to the Minister for a permit to return to be issued;
“relevant return time” means –
(a) the time at which the individual is permitted to arrive on return to Jersey (in a case where the permit to return states such a time), or
(b) the start of the period of time during which the individual is permitted to arrive on return to Jersey (in a case where the permit to return states such a period).
Issue of permit to return: deportation or urgent situation.
7.—(1) The Minister must issue a permit to return to an individual if the Minister considers that the individual is to be deported to Jersey.
(2) The Minister may issue a permit to return to an individual if –
(a) the Minister considers that, because of the urgency of the situation, it is expedient to issue a permit to return even though no application has been made under section 6, and
(b) there is no duty to issue a permit to return under subsection (1).
(3) Subsection (1) or (2) applies whether or not any request has been made to issue the permit to return under that provision.
Permit to return: supplementary provision.
8.—(1) The Minister may vary a permit to return.
(2) The Minister may revoke a permit to return issued to an individual only if –
(a) the permit to return has been issued under section 6 and the individual asks the Minister to revoke it;
(b) the permit to return has been issued under section 7(1) and the Minister no longer considers that the individual is to be deported to Jersey;
(c) the permit to return has been issued under section 7(2) and the Minister no longer considers that, because of the urgency of the situation, the issue of the permit to return is expedient;
(d) the Minister issues a subsequent permit to return to the individual; or
(e) the Minister considers that the permit to return has been obtained by misrepresentation.
(3) The making of an application for a permit to return to be issued under section 6 (whether or not resulting in a permit to return being issued) does not prevent a subsequent application from being made.
(4) The issuing of a permit to return (whether or not resulting in the individual’s return to Jersey) does not prevent a subsequent permit to return from being issued (whether or not the earlier permit is still in force).
Obligations after return to Jersey
Obligations after return to Jersey.
9.—(1) The Minister may, by notice, impose any or all of the permitted obligations on an individual who –
(a) is subject to a temporary exclusion order, and
(b) has returned to Jersey.
(2) The “permitted obligations” are –
(a) an obligation –
(i) to report to a police station at such times and in such manner as the Minister may by notice require, and to comply with any directions given by a police officer in relation to such reporting;
(ii) to attend appointments with specified persons or persons of specified descriptions at specified times and places, and to comply with any reasonable directions given by the Minister that relate to matters about which the individual is required to attend an appointment;
(b) an obligation to notify the police, in such manner as a notice under this section may require, of –
(i) the individual’s place (or places) of residence, and

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulations 2 to 8 of these Regulations amend respectively the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1967), the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/207), the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/1792), the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/213), the Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/214), the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/794) and the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376).
In particular, those amendments provide that payments made to a benefit recipient—

under the Windrush Compensation (Expenditure) Act 2020 (c. 8) (“the Windrush Act”),

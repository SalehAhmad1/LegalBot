(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (School Teachers’ Qualifications) (England) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”).
The amendments made by these Regulations expand the categories of institution the Secretary of State may accredited as a provider of initial teacher training under regulation 11 of the 2003 Regulations. They also amend the type of setting at which experience or employment may be gained leading to a person being a qualified teacher under regulation 5 of the 2003 Regulations.
Regulation 2(2) removes from the interpretation provisions of the 2003 Regulations the definition of “institution”. Regulation 2(2) also inserts into regulation 3 of the 2003 Regulations a definition of “early years provider”, to accommodate use of the term in the amendments made by these Regulations.
Regulation 2(3) amends the type of setting (to include for 3 routes any educational institution or early years provider) at which experience or employment might be gained leading to qualified teacher status under three routes detailed in Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the 2003 Regulations. It also amends the reference to educational “establishment”, in paragraph 11(4)(c), replacing it with reference to educational “institution”, for consistency with use of the term elsewhere in the 2003 Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

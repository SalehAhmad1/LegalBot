2nd December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(c)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
The Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations 2009 (“the principal Regulations”) impose requirements and prohibitions in relation to the carriage of dangerous goods by road and rail, and to a limited extent by inland waterway. In doing so they implement certain Directives as respects Great Britain.
The principal Regulations were amended by the Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1111) with effect from IP completion day, which made provision to implement Part 3 (separation provisions) of the “Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community” dated 19th October 2019 (the “Withdrawal Agreement”), and the “Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland” in the Withdrawal Agreement. Those amendments included amendments to Part 4 of the principal Regulations, which makes provision for the conformity assessment of transportable pressure equipment (“TPE”) which is placed on the market in Great Britain (“the GB market”). The amendments provided for the operation of a dual system after IP completion day under which both of the following may be placed on the GB market:
(a)
TPE which meets the EU conformity assessment requirements (bearing the “pi” marking set out in the Transportable Pressure Equipment Directive, known as “pi marked TPE”), and which includes TPE which has been conformity assessed by a notified body established in Northern Ireland and bearing the pi marking accompanied by the indication “UK(NI)”, and
(b)
TPE which meets the Great Britain conformity assessment requirements (bearing the “rho” marking prescribed by the principal Regulations, and known as “UK TPE”).
This dual system, under which EU conformity assessed TPE continues to be accepted on the GB market, is not reciprocal.
This instrument brings that dual system to an end with effect from 1st January 2023. It provides that the only TPE which may be placed on the GB market from that date is UK TPE, or TPE which complies with Part 4 of the Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 and which are “qualifying Northern Ireland goods” within the meaning given in regulations made under section 8C(6) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (referred to in these Regulations as “Northern Ireland TPE”), and it makes consequential changes to Part 4 of the principal Regulations. It implements Article 41 of the Withdrawal Agreement by providing that any EU assessed pi marked TPE which was placed on the GB market prior to that date may remain on the market, but subject to certain restrictions.
This instrument also makes provision to implement Article 46(1) of the Withdrawal Agreement, pursuant to section 8B(1)(a) of the 2018 Act. Article 46 requires the United Kingdom to ensure that certain information held by conformity assessment bodies in the United Kingdom is made available to notified bodies established in Member States. This instrument amends Schedule 3 of the principal Regulations to provide for conformity assessment bodies in Great Britain to be required to share information in those circumstances.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

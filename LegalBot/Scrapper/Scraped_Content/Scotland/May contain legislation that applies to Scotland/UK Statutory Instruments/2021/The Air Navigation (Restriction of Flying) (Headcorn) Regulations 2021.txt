These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Headcorn/Lashenden 
Aerodrome, Kent, during air displays that are scheduled to take place there on 25th, 26th and 27th 
June 2021 (inclusive). Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the

should be restricted in the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC), which for the 
purpose of these Regulations is one hour behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2), the Battle of Britain Air Show flying 
display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of the Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).

The terms “determination notice”, “EU trade remedies measure”, “replacement of EU trade duty”, and “UK trade remedies measure” are defined in regulation 94 of the 2019 Regulations.
Any determination notice or public notice referred to in these Regulations will be available to view online at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/trade-remedies-notices.

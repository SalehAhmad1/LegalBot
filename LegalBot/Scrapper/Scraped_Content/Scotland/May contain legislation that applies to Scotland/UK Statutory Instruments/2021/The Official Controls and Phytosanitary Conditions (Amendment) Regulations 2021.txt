(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision to supplement Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (“the Official Controls Regulation”). Specifically, it supplements (and modifies) the transitional derogations and modifications specified in Article 168 of, and Annex 6 to, the Official Controls Regulation, by providing for official controls that are carried out under the Official Controls Regulation on certain goods listed in the Schedule to the Regulations to be carried out at the place of destination (as defined).
Part 2 of these Regulations also amends the provisions relating to offences in the Official Controls (Plant Health and Genetically Modified Organisms) (England) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1517).
Part 3 of these Regulations amends Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 establishing uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and the Council, as regards protective measures against pests of plants, to include additional measures to prevent the establishment or spread of Xylella fastidiosa (Wells et al.) in Great Britain.

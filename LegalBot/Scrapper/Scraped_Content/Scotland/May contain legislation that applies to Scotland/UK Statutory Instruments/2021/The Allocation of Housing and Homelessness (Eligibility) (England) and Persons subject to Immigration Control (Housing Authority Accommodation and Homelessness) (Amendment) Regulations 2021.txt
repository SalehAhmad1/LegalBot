(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/1294) to ensure that persons granted leave in accordance with the immigration rules made under section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971, where such leave is granted by virtue of the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy or the previous scheme for locally-employed staff in Afghanistan (otherwise known as the ex-gratia scheme) and certain persons who left Afghanistan in connection with the collapse of the Afghan government that took place on 15th August 2021, are eligible for an allocation of housing accommodation and for housing assistance. The amendments also exempt those persons from the habitual residence test.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends the Persons subject to Immigration Control (Housing Authority Accommodation and Homelessness) Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/706) to enable housing authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland to provide housing accommodation and housing authorities in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to provide homelessness assistance to those persons referred to above that are subject to immigration control without application of the habitual residence test.
A full Regulatory Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this instrument because the impact on business is not likely to be significant.

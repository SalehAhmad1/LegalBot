23rd November 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 84 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (c. 48) requires certain pensions and other benefits under occupational pension schemes to be revalued by the final salary method (which is dealt with in Schedule 3 to that Act). For the purpose of the revaluation of benefits payable to or in respect of persons who attain their scheme’s normal pension age in 2022, and as required by paragraph 2 of Schedule 3 to that Act, this Order specifies the necessary revaluation percentages for each of the revaluation periods between 1st January 1986 and 31st December 2021. It is not necessary to specify a lower revaluation percentage for revaluation periods which start before 1st January 2009.
This Order amends an existing regulatory regime by a pre-determined formula, and the administrative impact of its implementation is negligible. A full impact assessment has not been produced for this Order as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

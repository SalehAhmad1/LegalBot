SCHEDULEEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Regulations amend Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Stamp Duty Land Tax (Administration) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/2837) to provide a new SDLT 1 form in connection with land transactions for the purposes of stamp duty land tax. (The SDLT 1 form is a “land transaction return” within the meaning of Schedule 10 to the Finance Act 2003.)
Regulation 2 substitutes a new form SDLT 1 for the form previously prescribed.
Regulation 3 makes transitional provision for forms delivered in respect of land transactions of which the effective date (defined in section 119 of the Finance Act 2003) is before 1 April 2021. In respect of those land transactions, the validity of the previous form of SDLT 1 is preserved, provided it is delivered before 1 May 2021.

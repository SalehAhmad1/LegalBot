At 9.55 a.m. on 1 December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 6 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 (“the Act”) lists certain persons as being a “public body” for the purposes of Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.
Part 2 of the Act sets out the well-being goals which public bodies must seek to achieve. Part 3 of the Act enables the office of Future Generations Commissioner for Wales to monitor and assess the extent to which the well-being objectives set by public bodies under Part 2 of the Act are being met.
These Regulations add corporate joint committees, established under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 to the list of public bodies in section 6 of the Act, and as such corporate joint committees are liable to comply with Parts 2 and 3 of the Act.
These Regulations also amend the Act by dis-applying section 9 of the Act in relation to corporate joint committees. Section 8A is inserted into the Act, which specifies when a corporate joint committee must set and review its well-being objectives.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the Regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) (“the International Travel Regulations”) to remove the United Arab Emirates from the list of exempt countries and territories in Schedule A1 to the International Travel Regulations, from which passengers arriving in England are not required to self-isolate.
Passengers are not required to self-isolate on arrival in England if, during the 10 days preceding their arrival, they have only been in or transited through exempt countries or territories, or exempt parts of countries or territories. Passengers who have been in or transited through a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory, must self-isolate until 10 days have elapsed since the day after they last left a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory. The change to Schedule A1 will not affect passengers who arrive in England before 4.00 a.m. on 12th January 2021.

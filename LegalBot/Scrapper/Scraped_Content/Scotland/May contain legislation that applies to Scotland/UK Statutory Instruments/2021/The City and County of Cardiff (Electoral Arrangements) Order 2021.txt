(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the recommendations of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”), which reported in November 2020 on its review of the electoral arrangements for the City and County of Cardiff. The Commission’s Report proposed a reduction in the number of electoral wards from 29 to 28, but an increase in the number of councillors from 75 to 79.
This Order implements the Commission’s recommendations, with modifications.
Article 2 of this Order abolishes the existing electoral arrangements for the City and County of Cardiff and introduces the Schedule, which sets out the new electoral arrangements for the City and County of Cardiff.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

These Regulations amend the Public Sector Apprenticeship Targets Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/513) (“the 2017 Regulations”). The 2017 Regulations set the public sector apprenticeship target for specified public sector bodies at 2.3% of their headcount, as new apprentice starts, for the period between 1st April 2017 and 31st March 2021. These Regulations provide that the same target will apply for a further year, beginning with 1st April 2021 and ending with 31st March 2022, that period beginning immediately after the end of the target period prescribed in the 2017 Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

21 December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Education (School Day and School Year) (Wales) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”) apply to schools maintained by local authorities and to special schools whether or not so maintained. They make provision, among other things, for a school day which is ordinarily to be divided into two sessions with a break in the middle, and for schools (other than nursery schools) to meet for at least 380 sessions during any school year.
These Regulations amend the 2003 Regulations to allow for up to four sessions to count as sessions on which the school met if they were devoted to the preparation of schools and planning by teachers as a result of the incidence and transmission of Coronavirus during the 2021-2022 school year. These sessions can be held in the first two days of the second term of the 2021-2022 school year.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations allow the Secretary of State to make a public notice applying tariff rate quotas to particular steel products. Regulation 3 provides that these tariff rate quotas may only be applied to steel products that were included in a taxation notice made under regulation 47(2) of the Trade Remedies (Increase in Imports Causing Serious Injury to UK Producers) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“the Regulations”). For the purposes of the Regulations and the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (“the Act”), regulation 4 provides that the public notice has effect as if it were made under section 13(3) of the Act and any tariff rate quota applicable under it has effect as if it were a tariff rate quota applied by virtue of paragraph 16(3) of Schedule 5 of the Act. Regulation 5 makes further provision for what should be contained within a notice made under these Regulations.

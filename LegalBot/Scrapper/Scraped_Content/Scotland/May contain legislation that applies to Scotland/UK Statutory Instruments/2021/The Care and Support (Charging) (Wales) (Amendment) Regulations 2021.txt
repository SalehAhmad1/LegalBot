(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Care and Support (Charging) (Wales) Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”).
The 2015 Regulations set out the requirements which local authorities must follow when making a determination of the amount of the charges which apply in relation to care and support which they are providing or arranging, or propose to provide or arrange, in the course of carrying out their functions under Part 4 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 (“the Act”). The 2015 Regulations also contain parallel provisions setting out requirements which apply where a local authority makes direct payments to meet a person’s need for care and support.
These Regulations amend Part 2 of the 2015 Regulations (charging under Part 5 of the Act) so that the weekly minimum income amount where a person is provided with accommodation in a care home is increased from £32 to £33.
These Regulations amend Part 4 of the 2015 Regulations (contributions and reimbursements for direct payments) so that the net weekly minimum income amount where a person is provided with accommodation in a care home and receives direct payments under the Act is increased from £32 to £33.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

Section 11(2) provides that the relevant steps may be taken if the prospective adopters satisfy the appropriate authority (defined in section 11(4)) that the authority should take those steps despite the special restrictions.
By article 2 of this Order, the Secretary of State declares that special restrictions are to apply to Nigeria.

23rd March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (School Teachers’ Qualifications) (England) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”), the Education and Inspections Act (Prescribed Training) Regulations 2007 (“the 2007 Education and Inspections Act Regulations”), the Education (Supply of Information about the School Workforce) (No.2) (England) Regulations 2007 (“the 2007 Information Regulations”) and the Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 2012 (“the 2012 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the 2003 Regulations to relax requirements during the period from the date of coming into force of these Regulations to 1st September 2021 relating to meeting prescribed standards before achieving qualified teacher status where it has not been possible to do so for a reason relating to the incidence or transmission of coronavirus. It also extends, to the same date, the period for completion of a period of practical teaching experience to be undertaken wholly or mainly outside England.
Regulation 2 also amends the provisions in the 2003 Regulations relating to the route to qualified teacher status for teachers coming to England from the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand so as to reflect the regulatory arrangements in those countries. It also sets out a route to qualified status in England for teachers who have completed a course of teacher training in Gibraltar.
The amendments made by regulation 3 to the 2007 Education and Inspection Act Regulations bring training for teachers which is funded by the Secretary of State within the scope of application of Chapter 3 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.
Regulation 4 amends Schedule 1 to the 2007 Information Regulations to require schools to provide information to the Secretary of State about the number of teachers who are serving an induction period and update those Regulations in relation to certain bodies which have been abolished or changed name.
The 2012 Regulations provide that no qualified teacher may be employed in a maintained school or a non-maintained special school unless they have satisfactorily completed an induction period. The amendments made by regulation 5 to the 2012 Regulations extend the length of an induction period from three school terms to six school terms, make some changes to the provisions for Appropriate Bodies, amend the reasons why a period of induction may be extended so as to include parental leave, paternity leave, and adoption leave, amend the percentage of time for which a teacher is expected to teach during an induction period, update those Regulations in relation to certain bodies which have been abolished or changed name, correct an error and make some consequential amendments.

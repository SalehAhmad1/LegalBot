(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/213) (“the Housing Benefit Regulations”) and the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376) (“the Universal Credit Regulations”). They extend the age ranges of the exemptions from the shared accommodation rate of the Local Housing Allowance which apply to care leavers and those who have spent at least 3 months in a homeless hostel whilst receiving support to assist with community resettlement or rehabilitation.
Regulation 2 amends the definition of “young individual” in regulation 2 of the Housing Benefit Regulations, insofar as it applies to care leavers, increasing the upper age limit at which individuals can be exempted from the shared accommodation rate from 22 to 25 years. It also reduces the lower age limit to qualify for the exemption from 25 to 16 years for those who have spent at least 3 months in a homeless hostel whilst receiving support to assist with community resettlement or rehabilitation. Regulation 2 also maintains the lower age limit to access the exemption at 25 years for those that are the subject of active multi-agency management pursuant to arrangements established under the Criminal Justice Act 2003.
Regulation 3 amends paragraph 29 of Schedule 4 to the Universal Credit Regulations to increase similarly the upper age limit at which care leavers are exempted from the shared accommodation rate from 22 to 25 years. It also reduces the lower age limit to qualify for the exemption from 25 to 16 years for those who have spent at least 3 months in a homeless hostel whilst receiving support to assist with community resettlement or rehabilitation.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

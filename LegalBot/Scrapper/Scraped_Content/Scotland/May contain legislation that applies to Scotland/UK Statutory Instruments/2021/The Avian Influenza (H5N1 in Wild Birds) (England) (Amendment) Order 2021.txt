23rd November 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, which applies in England only, amends the Avian Influenza (H5N1 in Wild Birds) (England) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/3249) (“the principal Order”).
It replaces the obligation on the Secretary of State to declare a wild bird control area or a wild bird monitoring area, or both, in certain circumstances with a discretion to do so (article 5).
The circumstances in which such a declaration may be made now include where the Chief Veterinary Officer advises the Secretary of State that the avian influenza virus of the H5 subtype is present in a wild bird or the carcase of a wild bird in Great Britain and she suspects an avian influenza of public health concern found in wild birds may be present.
Article 3 amends article 2 of the principal Order to include a definition of “avian influenza of public health concern found in wild birds”.
Article 5 and 6 make consequential amendments to articles 6 and 8 of the principal Order.
Article 7 amends the restriction in article 12(1) of the principal Order which prohibits the Secretary of State from amending the declaration of a wild bird control area so that it becomes part of the wild bird monitoring area or revoking the declaration of either area within a specified timeframe. The prohibition is disapplied (by an amendment to article 12(4) of the principal Order) where, on the basis of a risk assessment, the Chief Veterinary Officer is satisfied that the strain of avian influenza present in a wild bird or carcase is not an avian influenza of public health concern found in wild birds.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

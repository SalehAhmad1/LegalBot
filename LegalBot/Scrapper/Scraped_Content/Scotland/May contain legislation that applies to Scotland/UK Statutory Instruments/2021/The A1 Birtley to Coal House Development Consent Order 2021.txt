Coming into force
9th February 2021
An application has been made to the Secretary of State under sections 37 of the Planning Act 2008 M1 (“the 2008 Act”) in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 M2 for an Order granting development consent.
The application was initially examined by a single appointed person and subsequently by a Panel of two members (“the Panel”) (appointed by the Secretary of State) in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act, and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010 M3.
The Panel, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn and the application together with the accompanying documents, in accordance with section 74 of the 2008 Act, has submitted a report and recommendation to the Secretary of State.
[F1The Secretary of State is satisfied in terms of section 131(4B) of the 2008 Act that (a) the order land forms part of an open space; (b) none of the order land is of any of the other descriptions in section 131(1) of the 2008 Act; and (c) the order land is being acquired for a temporary (although possibly long-lived) purpose.
The Secretary of State is further satisfied in terms of section 131(5) of the 2008 Act that (a) the order land is required in connection with the widening or drainage of an existing highway; and (b) the giving of other land in exchange for the order land is unnecessary.]
The Secretary of State, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn, and the report of the Panel, has decided to make an Order granting development consent for the development described in the application with modifications which in the opinion of the Secretary of State do not make any substantial changes to the proposals comprised in the application.
The Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 114, 115 M4, 117, 120 [F1, 122, 131 and 132] F2... of, and paragraphs 1 to 3, 10 to 17, 19 to 23, 26, 33, 36 and 37 of Part 1 of Schedule 5 M5 to, the 2008 Act, makes the following Order—

(4) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(5) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (4), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.

(5) Section 11 M2 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, as from the date on which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 23), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A M3 (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B M4 (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12 M5 (unauthorised entry) and 13 M6 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 M7 (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 28(4) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND NOT IN NOTICE TO TREAT
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and has not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 29 (application of the 1981 Act) of the A1 Birtley to Coal House Development Consent Order 2021 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 30(3) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the A1 Birtley to Coal House Development Consent Order 2021 which excludes the application of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker's apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (6).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days' written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed the utility undertaker must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46, and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.

(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.

Expenses and costs
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker all expenses reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

Removal of apparatus
45.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that Northumbrian Water's apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of Northumbrian Water to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of Northumbrian Water in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (8).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to Northumbrian Water 56 days' written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Northumbrian Water reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Northumbrian Water the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for access to and the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker, after using all reasonable endeavours is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed Northumbrian Water must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably practicable use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Northumbrian Water and the undertaker both acting reasonably with a view to securing the efficient implementation of the necessary work, the avoidance of unnecessary delay and the continued fulfilment by both parties of their service obligations, which in the case of Northumbrian Water shall be to a standard no less than that achieved prior to the removal of the apparatus which the alternative apparatus replaces, or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(5) Northumbrian Water must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration), and after the grant to Northumbrian Water of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs 45(2) or 45(3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this part of this schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph 45(5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to Northumbrian Water that the undertaker intends to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by Northumbrian Water, may, subject to the written consent of Northumbrian Water, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and in accordance with Northumbrian Water's requirements and specifications, be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Northumbrian Water.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph 45(6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute the filling around the apparatus (where apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of apparatus.
(8) When alternative apparatus is to be or is being substituted for existing apparatus, the undertaker shall, before taking or requiring any further step in such substitution works, use all reasonable endeavours to comply with Northumbrian Water's reasonable requests for a reasonable period of time to enable Northumbrian Water to:
(a)
make network contingency arrangements; or
(b)
bring such matters as it may consider reasonably necessary to the attention of end users of the utility in question.

Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
46.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this schedule, the undertaker affords to Northumbrian Water facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such reasonable terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Northumbrian Water or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus the arbitrator must:
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised development and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the undertaker or the traffic on the highway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted and have regard to Northumbrian Water's statutory obligations.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Northumbrian Water than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Northumbrian Water as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
(4) Such facilities and rights as are set out in this paragraph are deemed to include any statutory permits granted to the undertaker in respect of the apparatus in question, whether under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 M11 or other legislation.

Retained apparatus
47.—(1) Not less than 56 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 45(2), the undertaker must submit to Northumbrian Water a plan, section and description of the works to be executed, together with an assessment of the impact of the works and proposed measures for the protection of Northumbrian Water's apparatus.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Northumbrian Water for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus and of its operation, or for securing access to it, and Northumbrian Water is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Northumbrian Water under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 28 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If Northumbrian Water in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 39 to 41 and 44 to 46 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 45(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give, to Northumbrian Water, notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), works are deemed to be in land near Northumbrian Water's apparatus (where it is a relevant pipe, as defined in section 158(7) (powers to lay pipes in streets) of the Water Industry Act 1991) if those works fall within the following distances measured from the edge of such apparatus—
(a)
where it is a water main—
(i)
3 metres where the diameter of the water main is up to and including 300 millimetres;
(ii)
4.5 metres where the diameter of the water main is greater than 300 millimetres, up to and including 600 millimetres; and
(iii)
6 metres where the diameter of the water main is greater than 600 millimetres; and
(b)
where it is a sewer, 6.5 metres.

Expenses and costs
48.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Northumbrian Water all costs, charges and expenses which Northumbrian Water may reasonably incur or have to pay or which it may sustain in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 45(2), including any costs reasonably incurred in connection with the acquisition of rights under paragraph 45(3) and in watching and inspecting the execution of works under paragraph 47(2) and in making reasonable requirements under paragraph 47(3).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions except where this has been solely due to using the nearest currently available type; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated except where the placing of apparatus at a different depth is required solely to achieve an equivalent capability and function to the existing apparatus,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 46 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Northumbrian Water in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus;
(b)
the provision of additional manholes, valves or wash-out pipes, where required to comply with design standards, must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(c)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Northumbrian Water in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on Northumbrian Water any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Subject to sub-paragraphs (7) and (8), if by reason or in consequence of the construction, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or any such works referred to in paragraphs 43, 45(2) or 47(1), or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by it) in the course of carrying out such works, or by reason of any subsidence resulting from such development or works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Northumbrian Water, or there is any interruption in any service provided or of any access to any apparatus, or in the supply of any goods or services, by Northumbrian Water or the performance of Northumbrian Water's functions, or any disruption to the normal operation of Northumbrian Water's apparatus resulting in an increase in the costs incurred by Northumbrian Water in performing its functions or in any loss, damages or penalty or fines, or Northumbrian Water becoming liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by Northumbrian Water in making good such damage or restoring the supply or service;
(b)
make reasonable compensation for any loss sustained by Northumbrian Water; and
(c)
indemnify Northumbrian Water against claims, demands, proceedings, damages, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Northumbrian Water,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or disruption or Northumbrian Water becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid.
(7) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Northumbrian Water on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Northumbrian Water or in accordance with any requirement of Northumbrian Water or under its supervision does not, subject to paragraph 47(8), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of paragraph 47(6).
(8) Nothing in paragraph 47(6) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Northumbrian Water, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(9) Northumbrian Water must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(10) Any difference arising between the undertaker and Northumbrian Water under this Part of this Schedule must be referred to and settled by arbitration under article 46 (arbitration).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Immigration (Disposal of Property) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/786) (“the 2008 Regulations”).
The 2008 Regulations enable the Secretary of State to sell, dispose of or retain property, and regulation 3 of those Regulations makes provision about the property to which those Regulations apply. Regulation 5(1) and (2) of the 2008 Regulations provides for the sale of property other than money after the expiration of the relevant periods referred to in regulation 4 of those Regulations. Under regulation 5(2), property may be sold at any time if it is a perishable article or its custody involves an unreasonable expense or inconvenience. Regulation 2(b) and (c) of these Regulations amends regulation 5(1) and (2) of the 2008 Regulations so that, in addition to allowing the sale of property, the property may be disposed of in accordance with regulation 5(2A) (as inserted by regulation 2(d) of these Regulations).
Regulation 2(d) inserts a new regulation 5(2A) into the 2008 Regulations which provides that property can be destroyed (defined as including by way of recycling) or donated to a charity or to a not-for-profit body.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

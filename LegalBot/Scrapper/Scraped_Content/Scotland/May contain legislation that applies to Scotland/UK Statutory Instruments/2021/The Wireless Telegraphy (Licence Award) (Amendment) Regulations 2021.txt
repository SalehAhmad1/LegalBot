The Office of Communications (“OFCOM”), in exercise of the powers conferred by section 14(1), (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7) and section 122(7) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006(1) (the “Act”), make the following Regulations.
OFCOM have not given notice of a proposal to make these Regulations under section 122(4)(a) of the Act nor published notice of a proposal to make these Regulations under section 122(4)(b) of the Act because it appears to OFCOM that by reason of the urgency of the matter it is inexpedient to publish such a notice and therefore, in accordance with section 16(2) of the 2006 Act, subsections (4) to (6) of section 122 of the Act do not apply.

5th March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Wireless Telegraphy (Licence Award) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1199) (the “Principal Regulations”).
Schedule 6 of the Principal Regulations deals with the determination by the Office of Communications (“OFCOM”) of the additional price to be paid by winning bidders of 700 MHz paired frequency lots. It is amended to correct a drafting error in paragraphs 3(1) and 3(2).
The Regulations delete wording in paragraph 3(2) and insert that same wording into paragraph 3(1). (The Regulations therefore make these paragraphs consistent with the similar wording in paragraphs 3(1) and 3(2) of Schedule 4 and paragraphs 3(1) and 3(2) of Schedule 5.)
These Regulations do not have any effect on the cost of business additional to the effect of the Principal Regulations and a full regulatory impact assessment of the effect the Principal Regulations will have on the cost to business has been prepared and is available to the public from the OFCOM library at Riverside House, 2a Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 9HA, telephone 020 7981 3000 or on the OFCOM internet website at www.ofcom.org.uk. Copies of the impact assessment have also been placed in the libraries of the Houses of Parliament.

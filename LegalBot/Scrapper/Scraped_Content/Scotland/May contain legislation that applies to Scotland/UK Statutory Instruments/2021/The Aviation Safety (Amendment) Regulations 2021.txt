5th January 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to retained EU law in the field of aviation safety.
Regulation 2 amends Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 923/2012 (rules of the air) to provide a definition for the term ‘with the surface in sight’ and to amend the rules on distance from cloud when aircraft are flying using visual flight rules (VFR) in classes D, F and G airspace.
Regulation 3 omits Articles 9 and 9A of Regulation (EU) 2019/947 (rules and procedures for the operation of unmanned aircraft) to remove the minimum age for remote pilots operating unmanned aircraft systems.
Regulations 4 to 6 amend Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 (aircrew), Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/395 (operation of balloons) and Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1976 (sailplanes) to permit the use of a medical self-declaration to operate certain UK-registered Part-21 aircraft (as that term is defined in the Air Navigation Order 2016) in the United Kingdom.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as no, or no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on the UK legislation website at www.legislation.gov.uk.

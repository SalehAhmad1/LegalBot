“INTERMEDIARY FOR A DEFENDANT
Appointment of intermediary to facilitate a defendant’s participation
18.27.—(1) The court must exercise its power to appoint an intermediary to facilitate a defendant’s effective participation in the trial where—

age, if the defendant is under 18, or
(ii)
mental disorder (as defined in section 1(2) of the Mental Health Act 1983(7)), a significant impairment of intelligence and social functioning, or a physical disability or disorder; and
(b)
the appointment is necessary for that purpose.

the recommendations in any intermediary’s report received by the court;
(c)
any views that the defendant has expressed about—
(i)
receiving the assistance of an intermediary,

other measures or arrangements to facilitate the defendant’s effective participation in the trial;

understand what is said and done by the court and other participants;

the likely impact on such participation and on such understanding of any mental disorder or other significant impairment of intelligence or social functioning;

for the duration of any specified such hearing or hearings, or for the duration of a specified part of such a hearing; or
(c)
for a specified purpose during a hearing.
(4) Unless the court otherwise directs, the appointment of an intermediary extends to facilitating the defendant’s communication with that defendant’s legal representatives for the duration and for the purpose of the appointment.

(a)
on application or on the court’s own initiative;
(b)
at a hearing, in public or in private, or without a hearing; and
(c)
in a party’s absence, if that party—
(i)
applied for the appointment, variation or discharge, or
(ii)
has had at least 10 business days in which to make representations.
(6) The court must not exercise its power to vary or discharge a direction for the appointment of an intermediary unless satisfied that—
(a)
since the direction was made—

the defendant’s communication needs have changed materially, or
(ii)
any other material circumstance has changed materially; and
(b)
the defendant will be able to participate effectively in the trial despite the variation or discharge of the direction.

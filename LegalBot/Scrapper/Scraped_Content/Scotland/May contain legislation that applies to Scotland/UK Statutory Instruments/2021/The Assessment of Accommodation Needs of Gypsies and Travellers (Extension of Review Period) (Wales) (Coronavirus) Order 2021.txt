17 March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends section 101(3)(b) of the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 (“the Act”).
Section 101 of the Act makes provision for the assessment of accommodation needs by a local housing authority of Gypsies and Travellers residing in or resorting to its area. Section 101(3) of the Act sets out the meaning of the “review period”, which is the period during which this assessment must be carried out.
The first review period under section 101(3)(a) was the period from 25 February 2015 to 24 February 2016. Under section 101(3)(b) all subsequent assessments were to take place during each subsequent period of 5 years. Due to the impacts of coronavirus on communities in Wales and the effect that it has had on administration within local housing authorities the review period, which otherwise would have come to an end on 24 February 2021, is extended by one year.
This Order amends the meaning of “review period” in section 101(3) of the Act so that the review period following the review period under paragraph (a) is increased from 5 to 6 years. Thereafter, the review period is 5 years.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

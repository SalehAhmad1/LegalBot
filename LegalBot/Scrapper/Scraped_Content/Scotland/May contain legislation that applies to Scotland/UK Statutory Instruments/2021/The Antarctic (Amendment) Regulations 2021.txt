Lat: 69°14′S; Long: 39°46′E
The Yukidori Valley (69°14′30″S, 39°46′00″E) is situated in the middle part of Langhovde, on the east coast of Lützow-Holm Bay, Continental Antarctica. The Area encompasses 2.0–2.5 kilometres by 1.8 kilometres, located between a tongue of the ice cap and sea at the western end of the Valley. The fellfield ecosystem and long-term monitoring sites are contained entirely within Yukidori Valley, and the Area boundary is designed to afford protection to the entire valley/catchment system. The Area does not include any marine area.
The location and boundaries of the Area are shown on Maps 1, 2 and 3 of the Antarctic Specially Protected Area No. 141 Management Plan, published at pages 58 to 60 of the Command Paper “The Antarctic Treaty: Measures adopted at the Forty-second Consultative Meeting held at Prague, Czech Republic, 1 – 11 July 2019”(1).

17 November 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order increases the maximum amount of candidates’ election expenses at local government elections in Wales. The increase reflects inflation since the maximum amount was last varied by the Representation of the People (Variation of Limits of Candidates’ Election Expenses) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/1870).
The maximum amount of candidates’ election expenses consists of a fixed amount (expressed in pounds) plus a sum (expressed in pence) for each entry in the register of electors.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

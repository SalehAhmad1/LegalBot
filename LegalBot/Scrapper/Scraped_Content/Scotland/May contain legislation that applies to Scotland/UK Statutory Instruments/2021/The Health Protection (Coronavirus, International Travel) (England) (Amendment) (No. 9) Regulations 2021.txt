23rd September 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (“the International Travel Regulations”).
Regulation 8 amends Schedule B1A so as, primarily, to add the following categories of persons to those in relation to whom the provisions of Schedule B1A are modified:
unaccompanied children, where it is not reasonable for a person with responsibility for the child to reside with them in accommodation designated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of Schedule B1A; and
children (and those who were children on the 1st September 2020) who arrive unaccompanied from countries listed in Schedule B1 for the purposes of attending boarding school in England.
Regulation 9 amends Schedule 2C so as, primarily, to extend until 26th April 2021 the point at which private providers can begin to provide tests in relation to arrivals required to obtain a managed self-isolation package. It also introduces a requirement for private providers to notify the Secretary of State of the number of tests they sell each day and the date on which the individual who has purchased the tests will arrive in England.
Other minor corrections are made to the International Travel Regulations.
Regulation 10 amends the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 to correct an erroneous cross-reference, and to delay the requirement for laboratories to notify technical information about certain samples until 15th March 2021.

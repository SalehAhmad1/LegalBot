(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the recommendations of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”) which reported in May 2019 on its review of the electoral arrangements for the County of Ceredigion. The Commission’s Report proposed a reduction in the number of electoral wards from 40 to 34 and a reduction in the number of councillors from 42 to 38.
This Order implements the Commission’s recommendations with modifications.
Article 2 of this Order abolishes the existing electoral arrangements for the County of Ceredigion and introduces a Schedule which sets out the new electoral arrangements for the electoral wards within the County of Ceredigion.
The Welsh Ministers’ code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

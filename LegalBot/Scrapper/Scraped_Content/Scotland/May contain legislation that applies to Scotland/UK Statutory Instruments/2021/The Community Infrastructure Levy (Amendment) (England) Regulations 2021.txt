1st March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Community Infrastructure Levy Regulations 2010 (“The 2010 Regulations”) provide for the imposition of a charge known as the Community Infrastructure Levy (“CIL”).
The 2010 Regulations were amended by the Community Infrastructure Levy (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/966), which inserted paragraph (7A) into regulation 60 of those Regulations. That amendment enables the Mayor of London, until 31st March 2033, to apply CIL to repay monies, including interest, borrowed by the Greater London Authority or Transport for London, provided the money borrowed is for the purposes of, or in connection with, the Crossrail project. This instrument amends the date in regulation 60(7A) of the 2010 Regulations so that for “31st March 2033” there is substituted a new date of “31st March 2043”. This extends the period of time within which the Mayor of London can collect and apply CIL to borrowing for the Crossrail project.
An impact assessment was prepared for the 2010 Regulations and laid in Parliament on 10th February 2010. No formal impact assessment was prepared for these Regulations as one is not required for a financial instrument.

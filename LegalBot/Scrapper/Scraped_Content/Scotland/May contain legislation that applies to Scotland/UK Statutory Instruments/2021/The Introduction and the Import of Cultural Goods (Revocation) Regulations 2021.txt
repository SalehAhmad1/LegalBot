(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (“the 2018 Act”) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (and, in particular, the deficiencies under section 8(2)(a), (b), (d) and (g)).
These Regulations revoke those parts of Regulation (EU) 2019/880 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the introduction and the import of cultural goods (EUR 2019/880) as form part of direct EU legislation. These Regulations do not affect the continued application of that Regulation in respect of Northern Ireland in consequence of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the European Union withdrawal agreement (which is provided for in section 7A of the 2018 Act).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

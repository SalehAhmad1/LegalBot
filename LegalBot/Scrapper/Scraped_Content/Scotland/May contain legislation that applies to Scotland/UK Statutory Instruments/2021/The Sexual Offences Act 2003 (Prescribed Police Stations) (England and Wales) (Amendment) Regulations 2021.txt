(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Prescribed Police Stations) (England and Wales) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/447) (“the 2018 Regulations”).
The Sexual Offences Act 2003 (c. 42) (“the 2003 Act”) imposes notification requirements on offenders convicted of certain sex offences. These offenders are called “relevant offenders”. The 2003 Act requires relevant offenders to notify certain personal information to the police. Section 87(1) of the 2003 Act provides that relevant offenders in England and Wales and Northern Ireland give such notifications by attending at any police station in the relevant offender’s local police area which is prescribed in regulations. The 2018 Regulations prescribe those police stations in England and Wales. Section 87(1) of the 2003 Act was amended in relation to Scotland further to the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012 (2012 asp 8), which replaced the individual police forces in Scotland with the Police Service of Scotland. The Police Service of Scotland has jurisdiction over Scotland as a whole and so the designation of local police areas is no longer required in Scotland.
These Regulations make changes to the list of police stations prescribed by the 2018 Regulations in 18 of the local police areas.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

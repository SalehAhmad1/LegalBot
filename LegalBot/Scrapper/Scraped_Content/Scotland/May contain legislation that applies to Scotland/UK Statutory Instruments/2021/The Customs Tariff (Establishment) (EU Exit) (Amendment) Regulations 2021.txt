28th April 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made by the Treasury further to Part 1 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (c. 22) (“the Act”). They amend the Customs Tariff (Establishment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1430; “the Establishment Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the definition of “Tariff of the United Kingdom” of the Establishment Regulations to refer to a revised United Kingdom tariff document for the purposes of the system known as the customs tariff (see section 8(2) of the Act) established by regulation 2 of those Regulations. The revised tariff document reduces the Most-Favoured Nation tariff rates previously applied to molasses resulting from the extraction or refining of sugar in line with the original policy intention. In giving effect to the revised tariff document, this instrument thus corrects an error in the Establishment Regulations. The revised tariff document also includes an additional commodity code with no impact on duty rates.
The United Kingdom tariff document was last amended by S.I. 2021/380.
There is no significant impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies as a result of this instrument.

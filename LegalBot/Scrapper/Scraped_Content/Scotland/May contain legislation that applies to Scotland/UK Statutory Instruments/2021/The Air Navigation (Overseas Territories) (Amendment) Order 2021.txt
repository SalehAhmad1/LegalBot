Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Air Navigation (Overseas Territories) Order 2013 (“the 2013 Order”).
Article 2(2) ensures that certain provisions of the 2013 Order made pursuant to section 61(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (power to provide for offences and penalties, etc.) apply to Anguilla with effect from 26th May 2021. A modified version of section 61(1) and (2) is extended to Anguilla from that date by the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (Overseas Territories) Order 2021 (S.I. 2021/477), replacing a previous defective version which had been extended to Anguilla by the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (Overseas Territories) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/1452).
Article 2(3)(b) amends Schedule 6 to the 2013 Order to the effect that Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands (“the Pitcairn Islands”) are an overseas territory to which the 2013 Order applies. The powers in the 1982 Act under which the 2013 Order is made are extended to the Pitcairn Islands by S.I. 2021/477. By way of incidental provision, article 2(3)(a) revokes a previous reference to the Pitcairn Islands in the 2013 Order, which was defective because the powers relied on by the 2013 Order had not been extended to those Islands at the time the 2013 Order was made.

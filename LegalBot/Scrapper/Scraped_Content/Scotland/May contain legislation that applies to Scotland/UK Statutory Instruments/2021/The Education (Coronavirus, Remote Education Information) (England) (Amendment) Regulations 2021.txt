4th February 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the School Information (England) Regulations 2008 (‘the 2008 Regulations’) (S.I. 2008/3093) and the Education (Independent Standards) Regulations 2014 (‘the 2014 Regulations) (S.I. 2014/3283). They come into force on 12th February 2021 and expire on 31st August 2021.
The amendments made by these Regulations require schools with state-funded pupils to publish information on how they are complying with the requirement to provide remote education imposed by the Coronavirus Act 2020 Provision of Remote Education (England) Temporary Continuity Direction given on 30th September 2020 by the Secretary of State for Education.
Regulation 3 amends the 2008 Regulations so that the governing bodies of maintained schools and non-maintained special schools must arrange for the information to be published on the school website or, if none exists, on an alternative website, the details of which are made known to parents. The amendments made by regulation 3 contain further, subsidiary requirements. Regulation 3 also amends the definition of a “non-maintained special school” in regulation 2 of the 2008 Regulations so that it reflects the definition of that term in the Education Act 1996.
Regulation 4 amends the independent school standards prescribed in the 2014 Regulations so that the proprietors of Academy schools, alternative provision Academies and other independent schools with state-funded pupils must ensure that the information is published on the school website or, if none exists, is provided to parents.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument because no significant impact on business, civil society organisation or the public sector is foreseen.

This Order amends the Armed Forces (Enhanced Learning Credit Scheme and Further and Higher Education Commitment Scheme) Order 2012 (“the 2012 Order”), which established the Enhanced Learning Credit Scheme (“ELC Scheme”) and the Further and Higher Education Commitment Scheme (“FHEC Scheme”). The ELC and FHEC Schemes provide payments towards the cost of different defined levels of post-service learning qualifications.
Paragraphs (2) to (4) of Article 2 amend Scheme eligibility conditions for individuals who ceased to be a member of the armed forces on or after 1st April 2011 and not later than 31st March 2016. The period within which these individuals must commence their course of higher learning is extended from 31st March 2021 until the tenth anniversary of their ceasing to be a member of the armed forces. Paragraph (5) of Article 2 corrects a drafting error with the numbering in article 12 of the 2012 Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the National Lottery (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1475) and amend the National Lottery Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/189).
These Regulations raise the minimum age at which a National Lottery ticket may be sold to a person from 16 to 18. Restrictions on sales of National Lottery tickets by vending machines are also amended to reflect this increased minimum age.
These Regulations also raise the minimum age at which a person may sell a National Lottery ticket to 18, unless the person has attained the age of 16 and either the sale has been specifically approved by a responsible person or the person has been authorised to sell National Lottery tickets by an authorising person.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

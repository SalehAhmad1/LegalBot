(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the provisions of the Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 (“the 2006 Regulations”) which govern the recording of a pupil’s non-attendance in a school’s attendance register where the non-attendance is related to coronavirus.
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations to extend the application of the requirement to record a pupil as not attending in circumstances relating to coronavirus where the non-attendance takes place in the school year 2020-21, to the school year 2021-22. It also ensures that the reference in regulation 6 to guidance published by Public Health England also extends to guidance published by its successor, the UK Health Security Agency.
Regulation 3 requires the Secretary of State to review the effectiveness of the amendments during the period ending with 31st August 2022.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

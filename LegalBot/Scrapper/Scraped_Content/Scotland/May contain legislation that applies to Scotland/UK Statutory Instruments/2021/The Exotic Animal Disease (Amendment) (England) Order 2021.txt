(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order applies in relation to England only and amends the Avian Influenza and Influenza of Avian Origin in Mammals (England) (No. 2) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/2702) (“the Avian Influenza Order No. 2”) and the Foot-and-Mouth Disease (England) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/182) (“the Foot-and Mouth Disease Order”).
Amendments to the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Order are contained in article 2 of this Order. These amendments introduce requirements for the testing of contingency plans and the use of standard testing methods, remove requirements for overstamping health identification marks for certain types of meat produce, and make provision for laboratories to be licensed for the handling of live foot-and-mouth disease virus.
Amendments to the Avian Influenza Order No. 2 are contained in article 3 of this Order. These include amendments to requirements relating to movements of birds to a third country from special category premises, provide for the early revocation of certain types of protection zones and allows the use of cleansed and disinfected egg packaging material in certain circumstances. The amendments also provide for the preventive slaughter on premises in restricted zones and set out the restrictions on wild game bird products in the protection or surveillance or restricted zones.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

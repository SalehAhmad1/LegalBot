(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (the “International Travel Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales to isolate for a period determined in accordance with those Regulations. The requirements imposed by the International Travel Regulations are subject to exceptions, and certain categories of person are exempt from having to comply.
Regulation 12E of the International Travel Regulations prevents non-exempt persons from entering Wales where they have been in a country or territory listed in Schedule 3A to those Regulations within the last 10 days of arrival.
Persons entering Wales after being in one or more of the countries and territories listed in Schedule 3 to the International Travel Regulations are not required to isolate. The countries and territories listed in Schedule 3 are referred to as “exempt countries and territories”.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends regulation 12E so as to allow entry into Wales for certain students under the age of 18 who have previously been in a country listed in Schedule 3A to the International Travel Regulations. Such persons are subject to specific isolation requirements.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations amends Schedule 3 to the International Travel Regulations to add the Azores, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, and Switzerland to the list of exempt countries and territories.
Regulation 5 of these Regulations amends Schedule 3A to the International Travel Regulations to add Montenegro and Thailand to the list of countries and territories subject to additional measures.
Regulation 6 of these Regulations amends Schedule 4 to the International Travel Regulations to update the list of specified sporting events. An individual is able to leave isolation to compete or train in, or provide coaching or other support to a person competing in a sporting event specified in Schedule 4.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

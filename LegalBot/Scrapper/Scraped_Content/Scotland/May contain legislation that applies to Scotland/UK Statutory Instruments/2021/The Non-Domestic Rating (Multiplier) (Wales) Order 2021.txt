7 January 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
In relation to Wales, the non-domestic rating multiplier is calculated in accordance with paragraph 3B of Schedule 7 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (“the Act”) for each financial year when new rating lists are not being compiled. New rating lists are not being compiled for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2021.
The formula in paragraph 3B of Schedule 7 to the Act includes an item B which is the retail prices index for September of the financial year preceding the year concerned, unless the Welsh Ministers exercise their power under paragraph 5(3) of Schedule 7 to the Act to specify, by Order, a different amount for item B. If the Welsh Ministers exercise that power in relation to a financial year, the different amount so specified must be less than the retail prices index for September of the preceding financial year. The retail prices index for September of the preceding financial year is 294.3.
Article 2 of this Order specifies that for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2021, the amount for item B is 291.0.
Article 3 revokes the Non-Domestic Rating (Multiplier) (Wales) Order 2020 which had specified the amount for item B for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2021 as 292.6.
In accordance with paragraph 5(15) of Schedule 7 to the Act, this Order will only come into force if it is approved by a resolution of Senedd Cymru before Senedd Cymru approves the local government finance report for the financial year beginning on 1 April 2021, or before 1 March 2021 (whichever is earlier).

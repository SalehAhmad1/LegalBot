  ”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Motor Vehicles (International Motor Insurance Card) Regulations 1971 (S.I. 1971/792) (“the 1971 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 makes changes to the format in which an international motor insurance card (more commonly known as a Green Card, but formally defined as an insurance card) must be presented by motorists visiting Great Britain. This regulation inserts a new template Green Card as Schedule 1 to the 1971 Regulations. The new template reflects the fact that the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State of the European Union. The previous template Green Card is retained in Schedule 2 to the 1971 Regulations (as renumbered by these Regulations) because it may still be presented until 31st December 2022.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An explanatory memorandum is available alongside these Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Official Controls and Phytosanitary Conditions (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/136) (“the principal Regulations”) to correct an amendment made by those Regulations to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU 2019/2072) which establishes uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and the Council, on protective measures against pests of plants. The amendment corrected by these Regulations relates to measures to prevent the establishment or spread of Xylella fastidiosa (Wells et al.) in Great Britain.
These Regulations also clarify that Part 2 of the principal Regulations applies in relation to the importation of “specified goods” (defined in regulation 2(3)(d) of the principal Regulations) for the duration of that part of “the transitional staging period” (defined in regulation 2(3)(e) of the principal Regulations) falling on or after the coming into force of the principal Regulations..

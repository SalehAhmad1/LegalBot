(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the recommendations of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”), which reported in June 2021 on its review of the electoral arrangements for the County of Monmouthshire. The Commission’s report proposed a reduction in the number of electoral wards from 40 to 39, but an increase in the number of councillors from 45 to 46.
This Order implements the Commission’s recommendations, with modifications.
Article 2 of this Order abolishes the existing electoral arrangements for the County of Monmouthshire and introduces the Schedule, which sets out the new electoral arrangements for the County of Monmouthshire.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

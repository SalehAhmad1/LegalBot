(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the recommendations of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”), which reported in March 2019 on its review of the electoral arrangements for the County of Powys. The Commission’s Report proposed a reduction in the number of electoral wards from 73 to 60, and a reduction in the number of councillors from 73 to 68.
This Order implements the Commission’s recommendations, with modifications.
Article 3 of this Order abolishes the existing electoral arrangements for the County of Powys and introduces the Schedule, which sets out the new electoral arrangements for the County of Powys.
Article 4 makes changes to the boundaries between the community wards of Llanerchyddol, Gungrog and Castle within the community of Welshpool. Article 5 sets out the number of members to be elected for those wards.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.
Prints of the maps labelled “1” and “2” to which this Order relates are deposited in the offices of the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ (Local Government Democracy Division), and with Powys County Council.

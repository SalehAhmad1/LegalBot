(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes transitional provision under section 53(10) of the Cathedrals Measure 2021.
Article 2 relates to the Church Dignitaries (Retirement) Measure 1949, which applies only to clergy who hold office on freehold, including those who hold freehold office in a cathedral. It provides for the references to cathedral chapters in the 1949 Measure to continue to be defined in accordance with the Cathedrals Measure 1999 for so long as there are cathedral clergy to whom the 1949 Measure applies.
Article 3 makes general transitional provision for ensuring that references in instruments or documents (but not legislation) to cathedral-related terms which are now out of date are, where necessary, to be read as references to the relevant term under the Cathedrals Measure 2021.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations 1985 (S.I. 1985/967).
In a report (published as Command Paper Cm 8860 on 8th May 2014(1)), the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council recommended that Dupuytren’s contracture, arising from work for ten years or more in aggregate which involves the use of hand-held powered tools, be prescribed as a disease. As a result of these Regulations, the prescribed disease is presumed to be due to the nature of a person’s employed earner’s employment. The amendments made by regulation 2 add Dupuytren’s contracture to the list of diseases for which Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is payable.
Hard copies of the report may be obtained from the Department for Work and Pensions, IIDB Policy, Disability Employment and Support Directorate, 3 South E, Quarry House, Leeds, LS2 7UA.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the definition of “exit day” in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (“the 2018 Act”) and come into force immediately after they are made.
In accordance with Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union and with the extensions provided for in European Council Decision (EU) 2019/476 (OJ L 80 I, 22 March 2019, p.1) and European Council Decision (EU) 2019/584 (OJ L 101, 11 April 2019, p.1), the Treaties of the European Union (“the Treaties”) were due to cease to apply to the United Kingdom at 11.00 p.m. on 31st October 2019.
On 29th October 2019 a further extension of the period in Article 50(3) was agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Council (European Council Decision (EU) 2019/1810, OJ. L 278 I, 30 October 2019, p. 1). As a result, the Treaties will instead cease to apply to the United Kingdom at 11.00 p.m. on 31st January 2020.
Regulation 2 amends the definition of “exit day” in section 20(1) and (2) of the 2018 Act to ensure that it reflects the new day and time that the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom in light of the further extension.

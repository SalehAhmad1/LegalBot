(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments in the area of agricultural market measures. Chapter 1 of Part 2 amends Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products, in particular in relation to provisions concerning aid for the supply of fruit and vegetables, bananas and milk in educational establishments; producer organisations; wine; import and export licences; and provision of information. Chapter 1 also amends Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 determining measures on fixing certain aids and refunds related to the common organisation of markets in agricultural products.
Chapter 2 of Part 2 amends retained direct EU legislation in relation to marketing standards for eggs, olive oil and poultrymeat. Chapter 3 amends retained direct EU legislation in relation to aid in the apiculture sector and aid for the supply of fruit and vegetables, bananas and milk in educational establishments. Chapter 4 amends retained direct EU legislation in the area of support for rural development.
Part 3 amends domestic secondary legislation in relation to marketing standards for eggs, olive oil and poultrymeat.
Part 4 revokes retained direct EU legislation relating to support for the olive oil and table olives sectors.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are the sixth commencement regulations made under the Children and Social Work Act 2017 (c. 16) (“the Act”). Section 10, Schedule 1, and Part 3 of the Act came into force when the Act was passed by virtue of section 70 of the Act.
Regulation 2 brings into force on 2nd December 2019 the remaining provisions of Part 2 of the Act, relating to transfer of the regulation of social workers in England from the Health and Care Professions Council to Social Work England.
Regulation 3 is a saving provision in connection with the coming into force of section 39(1) of the Act. It saves article 14(b) of the Health Professions Order 2001 (S.I. 2002/254), which would otherwise be revoked by regulation 41(3) of the Social Workers Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/893) which come into force on the date on which section 39(1) comes into force, so that article 14(b) continues to apply except in relation to standards and requirements which were established in relation to social workers in England before the coming into force of section 39(1).
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT REGULATIONS

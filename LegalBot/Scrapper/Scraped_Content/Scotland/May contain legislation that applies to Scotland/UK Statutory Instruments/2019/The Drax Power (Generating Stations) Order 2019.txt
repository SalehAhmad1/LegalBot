Art. 10 in force at 25.10.2019, see art. 1Construction and maintenance of new or altered means of access
11.—(1) Those parts of each means of access specified in Part 1 of Schedule 5 (those parts of the access to be maintained at the public expense) to be constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed by the highway authority, must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from their completion and from the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the highway authority.
(2) Those parts of each means of access specified in Part 2 of Schedule 5 (those parts of the access to be maintained by the street authority) to be constructed under this Order and which are not intended to be a public highway must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from their completion and from the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the street authority.
(3) Those restoration works carried out pursuant to article 10(3) (power to alter layout, etc., of streets) identified in Part 3 of Schedule 5 (those works to restore the temporary accesses which will be maintained by the street authority) which are not intended to be a public highway must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and must be maintained by and at the expense of the street authority.
(4) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(5) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (4), a court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street including the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of that part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given that person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that those instructions had been carried out.
(6) Nothing in this article—
(a)
prejudices the operation of section 87 of the 1991 Act (prospectively maintainable highways) and the undertaker is not by reason of any duty under that section to maintain a street to be taken to be a street authority in relation to that street for the purposes of Part 3 of that Act; or
(b)
has effect in relation to street works with regard to which Part 3 of the 1991 Act [F1applies].

(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 of the 1965 Act (powers of entry) is modified to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restriction, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applied to compulsory acquisition under article 19), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12 (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13 (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 of the 1965 Act (protection for interests of tenants at will, etc.) applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 of the 1965 Act (interests omitted from purchase) as modified by article 26(3) is also modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, or enforce the restriction imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER–NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 24 (application of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981) of the Drax Power (Generating Stations) Order 2019 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 25 (acquisition of subsoil only) of the Drax Power (Generating Stations) Order 2019 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter–notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of twenty-eight days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat;
(b)
accept the counter-notice; or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory; or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant;
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed; and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

(2) The appeal process is to be as follows—
(a)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the article or Requirement which is the subject of the appeal (together with the undertaker, these are the “appeal parties”);
(b)
as soon as is practicable after receiving the appeal documentation, the Secretary of State must appoint a person to determine the appeal and must forthwith notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for his attention should be sent, the date of such notification being the “start date” for the purposes of this sub-paragraph (2);
(c)
the relevant authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the article or Requirement which is the subject of the appeal must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within ten business days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(d)
the appeal parties must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within ten business days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph (c) above; and
(e)
the appointed person must make his decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within thirty business days of the deadline for the receipt of counter-submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (d).
(3) The appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (2)(b) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.

(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule.

(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of twenty-one days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than twenty-eight days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.

9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph 51(5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to Northern Powergrid that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by Northern Powergrid, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Northern Powergrid.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph 51(6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.

52.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to Northern Powergrid facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Northern Powergrid or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 63.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Northern Powergrid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Northern Powergrid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

53.—(1) Not less than ninety days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 51(2), the undertaker must submit to Northern Powergrid a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph 53(1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph 53(3) by Northern Powergrid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Northern Powergrid is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Northern Powergrid under sub-paragraph 53(2) must be made within a period of twenty-one days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph 53(1) are submitted to it.
(4) If Northern Powergrid in accordance with sub-paragraph 53(3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 47 to 52 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 51(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than twenty-eight days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph 53(1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to Northern Powergrid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph 53(2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.

Sch. 12 para. 53 in force at 25.10.2019, see art. 1
54.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Northern Powergrid the reasonable expenses incurred by Northern Powergrid—
(a)
in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 51(2); and
(b)
in assessing and preparing a design for its apparatus to address and accommodate the proposals of the undertaker whether or not the undertaker proceeds to implement those proposals or alternative or none at all,
provided that if it so prefers Northern Powergrid may abandon apparatus that the undertaker does not seek to remove in accordance with paragraph 51(1) having first decommissioned such equipment.
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph 54(1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal and for the avoidance of doubt, if the apparatus removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule has nil value, no sum will be deducted from the amount payable under sub-paragraph 54(1).
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 63 to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Northern Powergrid by virtue of sub-paragraph 54(1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph 54(3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 51(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Northern Powergrid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph 54(1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Northern Powergrid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

55.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs 55(2) and 55(3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 51(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Northern Powergrid, or there is any interruption in any service provided by Northern Powergrid, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Northern Powergrid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Northern Powergrid for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by Northern Powergrid,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph 55(1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Northern Powergrid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) Northern Powergrid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

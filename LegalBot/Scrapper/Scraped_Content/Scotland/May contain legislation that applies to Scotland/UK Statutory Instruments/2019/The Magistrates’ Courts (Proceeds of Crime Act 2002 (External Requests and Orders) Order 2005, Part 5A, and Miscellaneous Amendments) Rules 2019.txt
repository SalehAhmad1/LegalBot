21st October 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
These Rules prescribe the procedure to be followed for applications to a magistrates’ court for giving effect in England and Wales to external orders under Part 5A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order 2005 (“the Order”). Part 5A of the Order was inserted by article 30 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Investigations and External Orders and Requests) (Amendment) Order 2018(1). Part 5A of the Order mirrors in large part the provisions of Chapter 3A of Part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (“POCA”), which was inserted by section 15 of the Criminal Finances Act 2017 (c.22) and makes provision for the forfeiture of certain listed items of personal or moveable property, where the listed property derives from, or is intended for use in, unlawful conduct. The property to which the forfeiture powers apply is listed in article 213B of the Order. These Rules similarly mirror in large part the rules relating to proceedings under Chapter 3A of Part 5 of POCA (the Magistrates’ Courts (Detention and Forfeiture of Listed Assets) Rules 2017(2)) and provide the relevant procedure for:
Prior approval for searches (see article 213E of the Order, mirroring section 303E of POCA);
Applications for release of detained property (see articles 213K and 213S of the Order, mirroring sections 303N and 303V of POCA);
Applications for forfeiture of detained property (see articles 213L and 213O of the Order, mirroring sections 303O and 303R of POCA);
Agreements about associated and joint property (see articles 213M and 213N of the Order, mirroring sections 303P and 303Q of POCA);
Applications for compensation (see article 213T of the Order, mirroring section 303W of POCA).
In addition, the Rules make provision for the manner in which documents are to be given in proceedings under Part 5A of the Order, for the transfer of hearings and for procedure at hearings.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

Department for Environment, Food and Rural AffairsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations amend transitional provisions contained in the Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products Framework (Miscellaneous Amendments, etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/821), the Market Measures (Marketing Standards) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/822) and the Market Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/824) to take account of subsequent amendments to the definition of “exit day” in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16).
These Regulations also make minor amendments to correct errors in the Rural Development (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/764), the Common Agricultural Policy (Financing, Management and Monitoring Supplementary Provisions) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/765), the Common Agricultural Policy and Market Measures (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/812) and the Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products Framework (Miscellaneous Amendments, etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.
The statutory instruments amended by these Regulations amend retained EU law in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy and agricultural market measures.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

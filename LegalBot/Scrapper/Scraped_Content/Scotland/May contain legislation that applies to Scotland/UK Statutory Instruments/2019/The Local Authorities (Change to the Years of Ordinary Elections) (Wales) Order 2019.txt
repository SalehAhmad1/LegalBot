17 September 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Welsh Ministers may, under section 87 of the Local Government Act 2000, make provision by Order to change the years in which the ordinary elections of councillors of any specified local authority are to be held.
Article 2 provides that councils for a county or county borough in Wales and councils for a community in Wales are specified authorities for the purposes of this Order.
Article 3 provides that the ordinary elections of councillors of county councils, county borough councils and community councils in Wales will take place on the first Thursday of May in 2022 instead of 2021. It does so by substituting “2022” in the appropriate places in the Local Government Act 1972, which sets the years of ordinary elections for county councils, county borough councils and community councils.
Article 4 provides that the current term of office of existing councillors elected to county councils, county borough councils and community councils in Wales is accordingly extended by one year.
Article 5 revokes the Local Authority Elections (Wales) Order 2014 (“the 2014 Order”). The 2014 Order provides that the ordinary elections of councillors of county councils, county borough councils and community councils in Wales took place in 2017 instead of 2016. The ordinary elections in 2017 have taken place and this Order substitutes “2022” in the Local Government Act 1972, therefore the 2014 Order can be revoked.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

Article 2 of this Order inserts new paragraphs into Schedule 8 to provide for compensation to be paid for improvements resulting from the application to the land of soil improvers, digestate, manure and fertiliser (with no limitation as to how those substances were acquired); and for improvements resulting from manure which is held in storage and has arisen from the consumption of corn (produced on the holding or not) or other feedingstuff not produced on the holding by livestock and members of the horse family on the holding.

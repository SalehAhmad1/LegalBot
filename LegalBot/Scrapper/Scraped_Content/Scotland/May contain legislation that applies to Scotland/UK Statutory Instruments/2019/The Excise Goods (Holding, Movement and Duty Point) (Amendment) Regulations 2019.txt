19th December 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Excise Goods (Holding, Movement and Duty Point) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/593). Regulation 2 amends the definition of “Member State” and “territory of a Member State” removing the territories of Campione d’Italia and the waters of Lake Lugano in the Italian Republic from those territories treated as excluded from the territory of the relevant Member State. This reflects amendments made to Article 5 of Council Directive 2008/118/EC (OJ L009, 14.1.2009, p. 12-30) by Article 2 of Council Directive 2019/475/EU (OJ L83, 25.3.2019, p. 42-43).

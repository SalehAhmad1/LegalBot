Coming into force

The Welsh Ministers make these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 1(1) and (3), and 5(1) of the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967(1),
and now vested in them(2), and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to the European Communities Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”)(3).
The Welsh Ministers are designated for the purposes of the 1972 Act in relation to the common agricultural policy(4).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the 1972 Act and it appears to the Welsh Ministers that it is expedient for the reference to an EU instrument in regulation 3 to be construed as a reference to that instrument as amended from time to time.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make miscellaneous amendments to secondary legislation in the field of sea fisheries that relates to Wales and the Welsh zone.
The amendments replace references to Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms with references to Regulation (EU) 2019/1241 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the conservation of fisheries resources and the protection of marine ecosystems through technical measures, which has repealed and replaced Council Regulation (EC) 850/98.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

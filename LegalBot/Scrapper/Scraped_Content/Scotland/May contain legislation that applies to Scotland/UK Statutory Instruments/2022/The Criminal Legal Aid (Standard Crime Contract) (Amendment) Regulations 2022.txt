23rd September 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Criminal Legal Aid (General) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/9) (“the General Regulations”), the Criminal Legal Aid (Financial Resources) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/417) (“the Financial Regulations”), and the Criminal Legal Aid (Remuneration) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/435) (“the Remuneration Regulations”). The General Regulations and Financial Regulations together prescribe circumstances in which an individual qualifies for criminal legal aid under Part 1 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (c. 10) (“the Act”). The Remuneration Regulations make provision for the funding and remuneration of services made available under sections 13, 15 and 16 of the Act.
These Regulations amend the General Regulations, the Financial Regulations and the Remuneration Regulations to reflect the replacement of the 2017 Standard Crime Contract with the 2022 Standard Crime Contract on 1st October 2022. The Standard Crime Contract governs the contractual relationship between providers (individual legal professionals) of criminal legal aid services and the Lord Chancellor.
Regulation 6 provides that these Regulations will apply to work done pursuant to determinations for criminal legal aid made on or after 1st October 2022, but also in relation to work done prior to that date where Clause 1.28 of the Standard Crime Contract specifies.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

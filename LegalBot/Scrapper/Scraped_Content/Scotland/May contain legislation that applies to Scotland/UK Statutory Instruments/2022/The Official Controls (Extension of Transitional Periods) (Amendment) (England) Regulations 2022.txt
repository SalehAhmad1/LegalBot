(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend, in relation to England, the Official Controls (Extension of Transitional Periods) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/809) (“the 2021 Regulations”), to change the end date of “the transitional staging period” from 31st December 2022 to 31st January 2024 (regulation 3).
“The transitional staging period” is defined in paragraph 2 of Annex 6 to Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (EUR 2017/625)). In accordance with that definition, the period ends, in relation to England, on the date appointed by the Secretary of State in the 2021 Regulations, as amended.
Regulation 2 amends the Meat Preparations (Amendment and Transitory Modification) (England) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1666) to extend the temporary suspension of the requirement for meat preparations to be deep-frozen where they are imported into England from EEA member States, the Faroe Islands, Greenland or Switzerland until 31st January 2024, bringing it into line with the extended duration of the transitional staging period.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

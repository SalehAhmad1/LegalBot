(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1862) (“the GMS Regulations”) and the National Health Service (Personal Medical Services Agreements) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1879) (“the PMS Regulations”), which respectively make provision in respect of services provided under a general medical services contract (“GMS contract”) and a personal medical services agreement (“PMS agreement”) pursuant to Part 4 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41). They apply in relation to England only.
The amendments change certain terms which are required to be included in GMS contracts and PMS Agreements.
Regulation 2(2) amends the requirement in GMS contracts to respond to a request for confirmation of exemption from vaccination for coronavirus by limiting it to circumstances where legislation requires individuals to be vaccinated unless exempt or where guidance issued by, or on behalf of, the Secretary of State advises such vaccination. Regulation 3(2) makes a corresponding change in respect of PMS Agreements.
Regulation 2(4) removes the requirement in GMS contracts for the contractor to submit to NHS England the complete records of any patients, on the contractor’s list, who have died. Regulation 3(4) makes corresponding provision in relation to PMS Agreements.
A full Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

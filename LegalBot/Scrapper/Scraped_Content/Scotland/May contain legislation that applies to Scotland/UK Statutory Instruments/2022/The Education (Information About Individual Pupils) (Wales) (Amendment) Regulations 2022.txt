(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Information About Individual Pupils) (Wales) Regulations 2007 (“the 2007 Regulations”).
Regulation 5 of the 2007 Regulations prescribes persons who may be provided with individual pupil information by the Welsh Ministers under section 537A(4) of the Education Act 1996. These Regulations insert a new sub-paragraph (i) into regulation 5(2) so as to add to the prescribed list of bodies to which individual pupil information may be provided (regulation 2(2)).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

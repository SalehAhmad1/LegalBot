At 10.00 a.m. on 7th July 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of powers conferred by Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on trade in seal products (EUR 2009/1007), in particular, Articles 3(4) and 4a(2).
They amend Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1850 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on trade in seal products (EUR 2015/1850) (“the 2015 Regulation”). The Regulations grant powers to the Secretary of State to recognise a body that meets the requirements set out in the 2015 Regulation and to suspend or remove the recognition of bodies that do not meet these requirements. They also grant power to the Secretary of State to amend the name of a body as it appears on the list of recognised bodies. The effect of these Regulations is that these actions can be performed administratively without the need for a Statutory Instrument. For consistency the EU Commission Decisions recognising the current set of recognised bodies are revoked. The validity of the attesting documents issued by these bodies have been retained. These bodies will be recognised under the administrative process established by these Regulations.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

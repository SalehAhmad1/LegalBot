(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) to amend the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the 2019 Regulations”).

oil refining goods and technology (as specified in new Schedule 2D),
quantum computing and advanced materials goods and technology (as specified in new Schedule 2E)
luxury goods (as specified in new Schedule 3A), and
iron and steel goods (as specified in new Schedule 3B).
The goods specified in new Schedules 2D, 3A and 3B are specified by reference to commodity codes which are set out in the Tariff of the United Kingdom.
Regulations 5, 6 and 7 provide for licensing and exceptions from the new restrictions, by amendments to Part 7 of the 2019 Regulations.
Regulations 8 and 9 make consequential changes to enforcement provisions in Parts 9 and 10 of the 2019 Regulations.

Art. 3 in force at made date
(1)
Paragraph 4(7) (“the provision”) has been repealed by paragraph 75 of Schedule 2 to the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021 (asc 4) (“the 2021 Act”). However, the provision has been saved by the Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021 (Transitional and Saving Provision) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/111 (W. 39)) in relation to a child or pupil provided with education under the old curriculum (i.e. in relation to whom the 2021 Act has not been commenced). The effect of that saving provision is that paragraph 4(7) of the Schedule to the Act remains in force until such time as the child or pupil is provided with education under the 2021 Act.Jeremy Miles

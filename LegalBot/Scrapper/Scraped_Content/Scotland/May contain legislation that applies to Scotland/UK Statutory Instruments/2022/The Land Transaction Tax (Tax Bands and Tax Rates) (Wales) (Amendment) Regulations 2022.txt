6 October 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Land Transaction Tax (Tax Bands and Tax Rates) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/128) (“the 2018 Regulations”) so as to insert revised tax bands and percentage tax rates for residential property transactions.
Regulation 3 applies the revised tax bands and percentage tax rates to residential property transactions where the effective date of the transaction falls on or after 10 October 2022.
Regulation 4 goes on to set out exceptions to the general application of the revised tax bands and percentage tax rates in respect of residential property transactions. Where the effective date for such transactions falls on or after 10 October 2022, but contracts were exchanged, or substantial performance of that contract took place prior to 10 October 2022, the buyer may elect to apply the tax bands and percentage tax rates that were in place before these Regulations came into force to that transaction. Such an election cannot be made in circumstances set out at regulation 5. The election must be made in accordance with the requirements of regulation 6, which also provides that such an election can only be made if it would not result in more tax being chargeable than would otherwise have been the case.
Regulation 7 sets out the revised tax bands and percentage tax rates that are to apply to the transactions specified in regulation 3.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

16 March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the County Borough of Caerphilly (Electoral Arrangements) Order 2021 (the “2021 Order”), which implements the recommendations for changes to the electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Caerphilly, as contained within the report of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales dated November 2020 (“the Report”), with modifications.
Article 4 of the 2021 Order gave effect to the Commission’s recommendations for changes to community ward boundaries within the community of Rhymney. The Report mistakenly referred to a transfer of an area from the Moriah community ward to the Twyn Carno community ward where it should have been from the St David’s community ward to the Twyn Carno community ward. Article 2 of this Order rectifies that mistake.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

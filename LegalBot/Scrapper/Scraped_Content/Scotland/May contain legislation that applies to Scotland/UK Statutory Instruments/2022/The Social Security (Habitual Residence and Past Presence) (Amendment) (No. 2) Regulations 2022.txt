In accordance with section 173(1)(b) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992(6) (“the Administration Act”), the Social Security Advisory Committee has agreed that the proposals in respect of these Regulations should not be referred to it.

1992 c. 5.Citation, commencement and extent
1.—(1) These Regulations may be cited as the Social Security (Habitual Residence and Past Presence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2022 and come into force on 18th October 2022.
(2) Part 2 extends to England and Wales and Scotland(1).
(3) Part 3 extends to England and Wales only.
(4) With regard to Part 4, the amendments made by regulation 4 have the same extent as the respective provisions which they amend.
(1)
The provisions being amended by Part 2 extend to England and Wales and Scotland. This instrument does not reflect the presumption that amendments will have the same extent and application as the provisions amended because the Secretary of State does not have executive competence to exercise functions, as regards Scotland, in relation to the benefits regulations amended by Part 3. The function of making regulations under sections 64(1), 70(4) and 71(6) of the Contributions and Benefits Act is exercisable by the Secretary of State by virtue of section 175(1) of that Act and the function of making regulations under section 77(3) of the 2012 Act is exercisable by the Secretary of State by virtue of section 94(1) of that Act. The functions of the Secretary of State under those provisions, as regards Scotland, transferred to the Scottish Ministers on 1st April 2020. Legislative competence for disability and carers’ benefits were transferred to the Scottish Parliament by section 22(2) of the Scotland Act 2016 (c. 11). Section 22(2) inserted an exception into reservation F1 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46) and was brought into force on 17th May 2017 by S.I. 2017/455, subject to transitional arrangements set out in S.I. 2017/444 which modified the operation of the Scotland Act 1998. Section 32 of the Scotland Act 2016 provides the meaning of “pre-commencement enactment” in this context. The transitional arrangements in respect of disability and carer’s benefits ended on 31st March 2020 (see regulation 4 of the Scotland Act 2016 (Transitional) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/444)). Accordingly, insofar as the functions under those sections of the Contributions and Benefits Act and section 77(3) of the 2012 Act are exercisable within devolved competence, they are now exercisable by the Scottish Ministers. To ensure that the provisions introduced by these Regulations operate identically across England and Wales and Scotland, the Scottish Ministers are making parallel regulations (the Social Security (Miscellaneous Amendment and Transitional Provision) (Scotland) Regulations 2022), to these Regulations which will come into force on 14th November 2022.Amendments to income-related benefit legislation

23rd September 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Amendments made by the Social Security (Habitual Residence and Past Presence) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/344) (“the principal Regulations”) enable certain persons arriving from the Ukraine to access income-related benefits upon arrival in Great Britain and disability and carers benefits upon arrival in England and Wales, provided they meet the other relevant entitlement conditions.
These Regulations make further amendments so that persons who do not require leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom in accordance with section 3ZA of the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77) but who would not fall within the categories already listed in the principal Regulations, notably Irish citizens, may access income-related benefits upon arrival in Great Britain from Ukraine (see Part 2) and disability and carers benefits upon arrival in England and Wales from Ukraine (see Part 3, in particular regulation 3(1)(b) and (2)).
Part 4 makes technical amendments to the principal Regulations and regulation 3(1)(a) makes a technical amendment to the provisions mentioned in regulation 3(2) correcting an error in the principal Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

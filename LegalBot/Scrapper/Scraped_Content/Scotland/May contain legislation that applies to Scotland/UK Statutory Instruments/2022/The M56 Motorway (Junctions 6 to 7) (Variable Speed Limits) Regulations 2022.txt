“off-slip road” means a road intended for the use of traffic exiting the M56;
“on-slip road” means a road intended for the use of traffic entering the M56; and
“the M56” means the motorway known by that name.
4.  The roads to which this paragraph refers are—

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce variable speed limits to–
(a)
the eastbound and westbound carriageways of the M56 motorway between junctions 6 and 7;
(b)
the entirety of the eastbound off-slip road at junction 6; and
(c)
parts of other slip roads at junctions 6 and 7.
Regulation 3 provides for variable speed limits to have effect on the roads specified in paragraph 1 of the Schedule. Where variable speed limit signs are in operation a vehicle may not be driven at a speed above the maximum indicated by each speed limit sign passed by a vehicle until it passes a sign indicating that the national speed limit applies or the vehicle leaves the roads covered by the regulation. Where a speed limit changes less than ten seconds before a vehicle passes the sign and the sign had indicated a higher speed limit, the regulation allows the driver to proceed at a speed up to the maximum applicable before the change. Where the speed limit sign indicates a speed limit when it is passed by a vehicle but less than ten seconds previously it was either giving no indication of a speed limit or that the national speed limit applied, the sign is to be taken as giving no indication of a speed limit to the vehicle passing it.
Contravention of these Regulations is an offence under section 17(4) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations as no significant impact on the cost of business or the voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

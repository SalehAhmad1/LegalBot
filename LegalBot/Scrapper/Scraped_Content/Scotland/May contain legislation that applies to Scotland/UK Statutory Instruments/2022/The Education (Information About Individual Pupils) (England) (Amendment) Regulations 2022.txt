30th May 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Information About Individual Pupils) (England) Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”). The 2013 Regulations prescribe information about individual pupils that schools are required to provide, on request, to the Secretary of State or other prescribed persons.
Regulation 2(2) of these Regulations amends the definition of “special educational needs provision type” in the 2013 Regulations so that it refers to the current version of the “Special educational needs and disability code of practice: 0 to 25 years”.
Regulation 2(3) to (5) of these Regulations amends Schedule 1 to the 2013 Regulations to expand the information that must be provided on request.
Regulation 2(3) introduces a requirement on schools to confirm: whether a pupil is no longer a looked-after child or no longer in state care outside England or Wales as a result of being adopted outside England or Wales; and whether a pupil has been identified as a young carer, and if so, by whom.
In the case of pupils receiving education provision in a range of specified circumstances other than at the school in question, regulation 2(4) amends Schedule 1 to the 2013 Regulations so as to require the school to provide certain information about that education provision. That information includes the identity of the provider of the education provision and the reason for that education provision.
Regulation 2(5) amends Schedule 1 to the 2013 Regulations to require local authorities, in respect of the pupil referral units that they maintain, and the proprietors of alternative provision Academies to provide certain information about registered pupils. The required information includes: the unique reference number of the educational establishment that the pupil was registered at before being registered at the pupil referral unit or alternative provision Academy; and the reason for the pupil receiving education provision at the pupil referral unit or alternative provision Academy.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

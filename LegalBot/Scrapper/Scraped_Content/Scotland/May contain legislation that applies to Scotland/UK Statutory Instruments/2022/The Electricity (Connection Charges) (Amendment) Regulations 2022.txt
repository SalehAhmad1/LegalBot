30th November 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Electricity (Connection Charges) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”) in relation to cases where a second connection, within the meaning given by paragraph 1 of Schedule 5B to the Electricity Act 1989, is required by a notice under section 16A of that Act given on or after 1st April 2023.
The 2017 Regulations make provision about the expenses of electrical connections, where a person (a “second comer”) obtains a connection to premises or a distribution system which makes use of electric lines or electrical plant previously provided for the purpose of giving a connection to other premises or another distribution system. In cases where other persons have paid for all or part of the expenses of the first connection, the 2017 Regulations require the relevant electricity distributor to recover an amount from the second comer and to apply that amount, less administrative expenses, to reimburse the persons who paid for the first connection.
Regulation 4 amends the 2017 Regulations to reflect changes to the circumstances in which second comers are required to make reimbursement payments, in particular to limit the circumstances where a second comer must make a reimbursement payment in respect of expenses relating to network reinforcement.
Regulation 5 also amends the 2017 Regulations so that distributors are not required to demand a reimbursement payment, or the appropriate part of any such payment, which the distributor is not required and does not intend to pay to an initial contributor under the provision in regulation 9(3) of the 2017 Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Care and Support (Charging and Assessment of Resources) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2672) (“the 2014 Regulations”). Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations lists categories of capital that must be disregarded by local authorities when calculating someone’s assets for charging purposes.
Regulation 2 inserts a new paragraph 41 into Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations. Paragraph 41 provides that payments made to an adult which would be disregarded under section 8 of the Social Security (Additional Payments) Act 2022 (“the Act”), are to be disregarded in the calculation of the adult’s capital for the purpose of an assessment of that adult’s financial resources. The Act makes provision about additional payments to recipients of means-tested benefits, tax credits and disability benefits.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

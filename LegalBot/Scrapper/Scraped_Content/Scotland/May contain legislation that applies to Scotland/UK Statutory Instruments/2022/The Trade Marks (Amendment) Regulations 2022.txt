6th December 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the power conferred by section 31(1) of the European Union (Future Relationship) Act 2020 (c. 29).
Regulation 3 amends section 56(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 (c. 26) (“the Act”) so as to provide that references in the Act to a trade mark which is entitled to protection under the Paris Convention or the WTO agreement include a mark which is well-known in the United Kingdom as being the mark of a national of the United Kingdom or a person who is domiciled in or has a real and effective industrial commercial establishment in the United Kingdom.
Regulations 4 and 5 amend section 56(2) of the Act and insert new subsection (2A). These extend the right of a proprietor of a well known trade mark (as referred to in section 56(1)) to restrain the use in the United Kingdom of a trade mark which is identical or similar to the well known trade mark irrespective of whether the goods or services are identical with, similar to or not similar to those for which the well known trade mark is protected, provided that the well known trade mark has a reputation in the United Kingdom and the use of the other trade mark, being without due cause, takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the well known trade mark.

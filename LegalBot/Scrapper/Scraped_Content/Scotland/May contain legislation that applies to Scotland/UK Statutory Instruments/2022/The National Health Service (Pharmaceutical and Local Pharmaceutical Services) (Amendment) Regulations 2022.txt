“Zero or nominal product reimbursement for coronavirus vaccines and antivirals
91A.—(1) In the case of the drugs or medicines to which paragraph (2) applies, determining authorities must ensure that determinations under section 164 of the 2006 Act(1) (remuneration of persons providing pharmaceutical services) in respect of pharmaceutical remuneration that relates to the supply or administration of those drugs or medicines either—
(a)
do not provide for or permit any reimbursement to be paid for the cost of the drug or medicine (and so the basic price of the drug or medicine, for Drug Tariff purposes, is zero); or
(b)
only provide for or permit nominal reimbursement to be paid for the cost of the drug or medicine.
(2) This paragraph applies to—
(a)
a drug or medicine which is used for vaccinating or immunising people against coronavirus (“a coronavirus vaccine”), if the conditions set out in paragraph (3) are satisfied; or
(b)
an antiviral drug or medicine which is used for preventing or treating coronavirus (“a coronavirus antiviral”), if the conditions set out in paragraph (4) are satisfied.
(3) The conditions set out in this paragraph are—
(a)
the Secretary of State (references to whom in this regulation encompass both the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and other Secretaries of State) has purchased coronavirus vaccines for supply as part of the health service;
(b)
the Secretary of State has made arrangements for all or part of the Secretary of State’s stock of coronavirus vaccines, purchased as mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), to be supplied to NHS pharmacists and LPS chemists, whether directly or via an intermediary, at no cost to the NHS pharmacists or LPS chemists;
(c)
NHS England has made arrangements for the administration of coronavirus vaccines from the stock mentioned in sub-paragraph (b) as part of an enhanced service; and
(d)
the coronavirus vaccine in question is from that stock and administered as part of that service.
(4) The conditions set out in this paragraph are—
(a)
the Secretary of State has purchased coronavirus antivirals of a particular type for supply as part of the health service;
(b)
the Secretary of State has made arrangements for all or part of the Secretary of State’s stock of that particular type of coronavirus antiviral, purchased as mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), to be supplied to NHS pharmacists and LPS chemists, whether directly or via an intermediary, at no cost to the NHS pharmacists or LPS chemists; and
(c)
the coronavirus antiviral in question—
(i)
is from that stock, or
(ii)
is not from that stock but is nevertheless of the particular type of coronavirus antiviral that is available at no cost to NHS pharmacists and LPS chemists under the arrangements mentioned in sub-paragraph (b).
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4), the Secretary of State may characterise the particular type of coronavirus antivirals that are available at no cost to NHS pharmacists and LPS chemists solely by reference to the presentation of the drug or medicine (as well as by reference to its active ingredient, strength or any, or a combination of any, other distinguishing characteristics).
(6) For the avoidance of doubt, determinations under section 164 of the 2006 Act that, in accordance with this regulation—
(a)
do not provide for or permit reimbursement to be paid for the cost of a drug or medicine (and so the basic price of the drug or medicine, for Drug Tariff purposes, is zero); or
(b)
only provide for or permit nominal reimbursement to be paid for the cost of a drug or medicine,
may nevertheless provide for or permit remuneration to be paid for any service provided by a NHS pharmacist or LPS chemist, in the course of which the drug or medicine is supplied or administered.
(7) In this regulation, “nominal reimbursement” means, in the case of a drug or medicine that has been provided at no cost to a NHS pharmacist or LPS chemist, payment of an amount that is paid in place of the amount that the NHS pharmacist or LPS chemist would ordinarily make from the difference between—
(a)
the amount that they paid for the drug or medicine when they purchased it; and
(b)
the amount that they are paid by NHS England in respect of the cost of that drug or medicine (most commonly the basic price listed in the Drug Tariff), if they supply or administer that drug or medicine under arrangements for the provision of pharmaceutical or local pharmaceutical services.”.

Amended by S.I. 2015/528, 2016/1077, 2020/1126 and 2021/1346.Signed by authority of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
James Morris
Parliamentary Under Secretary of State
Department of Health and Social CareEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013 (“the PLPS Regulations”). The PLPS Regulations govern the arrangements in England, under Part 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (“the Act”), for the provision of pharmaceutical and local pharmaceutical services.
The scheme for paying for pharmaceutical and local pharmaceutical services in Part 7 of the Act is predicated on the basis that the determining authorities for pharmaceutical remuneration will ordinarily include, in the payments for those services, an amount which is in respect of (but ordinarily slightly more than) the price paid by service providers when they purchased the prescription items that they supply or administer to NHS patients. However, there are powers in Part 7 to enable alternatives to these ordinary remuneration arrangements in some circumstances.
A new regulation 91A is included in the PLPS Regulations which provides that, where the Government has centrally purchased coronavirus vaccines or coronavirus antivirals and makes those products available to community pharmacies at no cost, the determining authorities for pharmaceutical remuneration are to set a zero or nominal NHS reimbursement price for those products, if certain conditions are met. However, this does not prevent the determining authorities from paying community pharmacies for the services (such as professional services) that they provide in conjunction with the supply or administration of those vaccines or antivirals (regulations 3 and 5).
These Regulations also make a small number of relatively minor amendments to the PLPS Regulations.
Applicants for inclusion in a pharmaceutical list (the basis on which most community pharmacies and all dispensing appliance contractors provide pharmaceutical services) are required to provide updates of the fitness to practise information about their superintendents up until they are actually included on such a list or the application can no longer be proceeded with (for example, because an application has been refused and the time for bringing an appeal has expired) – and consequential amendments are made to provide for the redetermination of applications where this becomes necessary on fitness grounds (regulations 6(2) and 7). The requirement for NHS England to keep lists of service providers that use the Electronic Prescription Service is removed (regulation 4). The consultation period in relation to applications to consolidate services onto a particular site is reduced (regulation 6(3)). The notice period where a community pharmacy on a pharmaceutical list wants to reduce its supplementary hours, which are ordinarily the hours it is open above 40 hours per week, is reduced – and the notification requirement is removed altogether where the pharmacy wants to increase its supplementary hours (regulation 8(2)). There is a new requirement for community pharmacies on pharmaceutical lists to undertake an annual workforce survey as part of its clinical governance obligations, but the existing requirement to undertake a patient satisfaction survey as part of those obligations is removed (regulation 8(3)).
A full impact assessment has not been undertaken in relation to this instrument as these Regulations are not expected to have a significant impact on the public and voluntary sectors, and only a limited impact on the private sector, below the threshold for undertaking a full impact assessment.

Coming into force
1st January 2023
The Competition and Markets Authority has recommended that the Secretary of State make an order specifying certain categories of agreements relating to specialisation for the purposes of section 6 of the Competition Act 1998(1) (“the Act”).
In accordance with section 8 of the Act(2), before making the recommendation the Competition and Markets Authority published details of the proposed recommendation and considered the representations about it which were made to it(3).
The Secretary of State has decided to give effect to the recommendation without modifications.
The Secretary of State has also decided to vary a retained block exemption regulation under section 10A(1) of the Act(4). Before coming to that decision, the Secretary of State has—
(a)
in accordance with section 10A(2) of the Act, had regard to the conditions specified in section 9(1) for exemption from the prohibition in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the Act, and
(b)
in accordance with section 10A(5) of the Act, informed the Competition and Markets Authority of the proposed variations and taken into account that Authority’s comments.
The Secretary of State therefore makes the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 6(2)(a), (5), (6) and (7), 10A(1) and 71(3) of the Act.
(1)
1998 c. 41. Section 6 was amended by paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 (c. 24) to give the function of making recommendations to the Competition and Markets Authority. The Competition and Markets Authority was established by section 25 of that Act. This function was previously the responsibility of the Director General for Fair Trading and then the Office of Fair Trading. Other amendments to section 6 were made by paragraph 38 of Schedule 25 to the Enterprise Act 2002 (c. 40) and S.I. 2004/1261.
(2)
Section 8 was amended by paragraph 38 of Schedule 25 to the Enterprise Act 2002 and paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013.

At 1.24 p.m. on 5th December 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is a block exemption Order under section 6 of the Competition Act 1998 (“the Act”). It gives effect to the Competition and Markets Authority’s (“CMA”) recommendation that certain specialisation agreements (as defined in article 3(2) of the Order) constitute a category of agreements which are likely to be exempt agreements as a result of section 9 of the Act. Agreements which fall within the category specified in article 3 of the Order are exempt from the prohibition in Chapter 1 of Part 1 of the Act (“the Chapter I prohibition”).
The block exemption applies to such agreements to the extent that they fall within the scope of section 2 of the Act (agreements etc. preventing, restricting or distorting competition).
The block exemption applies from 1st January 2023 (see article 1(b)) and will cease to have effect at the end of 31st December 2035 (see article 14).
The block exemption can be cancelled before 31st December 2035 in respect of some specialisation agreements if:
there is a breach of the condition relating to market share in article 5, although if the condition is met initially, and only subsequently breached, the breach has the effect of cancelling the block exemption in respect of the agreement but only with effect from the end of the period of two consecutive calendar years following the year in which the market share threshold was first exceeded (see article 5(3));
a hardcore restriction is included in the agreement (see article 7);
the CMA cancels the effect of the exemption:
because of a failure of an undertaking to provide it with information about the agreement (see article 8(2));
because it considers that a particular agreement is not one which is exempt from the Chapter I prohibition as a result of section 9 of the Act (see article 9(1)).
The CMA is given a power to ask for information about agreements to which a person is a party (see article 8(1)).
A transitional provision also ensures that the Chapter I prohibition does not apply for two years to pre-existing agreements which satisfied the conditions for exemption provided for in Commission Regulation (EU) 1218/2010 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to certain categories of specialisation agreements (EUR 2010/1218) but which do not otherwise satisfy the conditions for exemption provided for in this Order.
The Order also amends Commission Regulation (EU) 316/2014 on the application of Article 101(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to categories of technology transfer agreements (EUR 2014/316) to replace the reference in that regulation to Commission Regulation (EU) 1218/2010, which expires on 31st December 2022, with a reference instead to this Order.
Guidance on the block exemption is available from the CMA online at http://www.gov.uk/cma or by writing to Competition and Markets Authority, The Cabot, 25 Cabot Square, London E14 4QZ.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared for this Order and is available alongside this instrument on the UK Legislation website www.legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in consequence of the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 (“the Act”). That Act reforms the law on education and training for children and young people with additional learning needs and renames the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales as the Education Tribunal for Wales.
These Regulations make consequential amendments to secondary legislation relating to education law in Wales.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

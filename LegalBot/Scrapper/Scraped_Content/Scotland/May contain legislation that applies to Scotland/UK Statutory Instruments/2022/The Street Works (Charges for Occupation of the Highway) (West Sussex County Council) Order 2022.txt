(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides approval for West Sussex County Council to require the payment of charges in accordance with the West Sussex Lane Rental Scheme (“the Scheme”) for certain street works carried out in the highway.
The requirement to pay charges to an Approved Authority is set out in the Street Works (Charges for Occupation of the Highway) (England) Regulations 2012 (“the 2012 Regulations”) (S.I. 2012/425). The term “Approved Authority” is defined in regulation 2 the 2012 Regulations.
The Scheme, which has been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of State, is designed to control the carrying out of works in specified traffic sensitive locations at traffic sensitive times. This will be achieved by requiring the payment of a charge, in accordance with the 2012 Regulations, for each day that the street is occupied by the works. West Sussex County Council may reduce or waive the daily charge and the Scheme contains guidance as to when a discount will be applied.
A copy of the Scheme can be inspected at the offices of West Sussex County Council, County Hall, West Street, Chichester, PO19 1RG. It is also available to view on West Sussex County Council’s website found at www.westsussex.gov.uk .

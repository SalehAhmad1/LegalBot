(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/692) (“the MLRs”) by substituting the list of high-risk third countries in Schedule 3ZA for a new list. Schedule 3ZA was originally inserted into the MLRs by the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) (High-Risk Countries) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/392) and was subsequently amended by the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) (No. 2) (High-Risk Countries) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/827), the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) (No. 3) (High-Risk Countries) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/1218) and the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (High-Risk Countries) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/393).
On the new list, Malta is no longer classed as a high-risk third country for the purposes of enhanced customer due diligence requirements in regulation 33(3).
Gibraltar is now classed as a high-risk third country for the purposes of enhanced customer due diligence requirements in regulation 33(3).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

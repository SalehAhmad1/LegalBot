(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) (England, Wales and Scotland) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/1427) (“the 2021 Regulations”).
The 2021 Regulations removed regulation 4B of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (“the 2001 Regulations”), that made it lawful to import, export, produce, supply, offer to supply or possess Gamma–butyrolactone (GBL) and 1,4–Butanediol (1,4-BD) in certain circumstances. The 2021 Regulations also added 1,4-Butanediol (1,4-BD) and Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) to Schedule 1 to the 2001 Regulations. The Schedule in which a controlled drug is placed affects the extent to which the drug can be lawfully imported, exported, produced, supplied or possessed. The controlled drugs placed in Schedule 1 to the 2001 Regulations are those subject to the tightest controls, requiring a Home Office licence in order to access such drugs.
Revocation of the 2021 Regulations means that the exemption in regulation 4B of the 2001 Regulations will remain in force and 1,4-Butanediol (1,4-BD) and Gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) will not be placed in Schedule 1, so a Home Office controlled drugs licence will not be required to lawfully import, export, produce, supply or possess these drugs.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

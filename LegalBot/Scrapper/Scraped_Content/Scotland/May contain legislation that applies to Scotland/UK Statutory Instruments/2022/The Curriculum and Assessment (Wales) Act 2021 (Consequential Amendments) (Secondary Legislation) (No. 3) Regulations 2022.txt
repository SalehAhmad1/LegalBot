Section 75(1)(b) of the 2021 Act further provides that the Welsh Ministers may make different provision for different purposes.
The new CfW will be rolled out for children and pupils in a phased manner. The new CfW will become mandatory for the year groups in schools and other settings as follows—
(a)
from 1 September 2022 for—

(iv)

(v)
children and pupils in year 7 who are provided with a relevant curriculum under Part 2 or 3 of the 2021 Act,
(b)
from 1 September 2023 for children and pupils—
(i)
in year 7, and
(ii)
in year 8,
(c)
from 1 September 2024 for children and pupils in year 9,
(d)

The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

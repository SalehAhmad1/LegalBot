EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Swansea Bay, West Glamorgan 
during air displays that are scheduled to take place there between 1st July 2022 and 3rd July 2022 
(inclusive). A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the 
displays and therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that 
flying should be restricted in the vicinity of the displays for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(a), The Wales Air Show 2022 flying 
display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr S J Maxted, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 383216.

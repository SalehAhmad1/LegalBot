87.—(1) For the purposes of these Rules, a “proxy” is a document made by a creditor, customer, member or contributory (the “principal”) which directs or authorises another person (“the proxy-holder”) to act as the representative of the principal at one or more meetings by speaking, voting on, abstaining from, or proposing resolutions.
(2) A proxy-holder must be an individual aged 18 or over.
(3) Proxies are for use at meetings called under the Regulations or these Rules.
(4) Only one proxy-holder may be appointed by a principal for any one meeting at which the principal wants to be represented, but the principal may specify one or more proxy-holders in the alternative, in the order in which they are named in the proxy.
(5) Without prejudice to paragraph (4), a proxy for a particular meeting may be given to whoever is to be the chair of the meeting.
(6) Where a proxy appoints the chair (howsoever described in the proxy) as proxy-holder, the chair may not refuse to be the proxy-holder.
(7) A proxy may be—
(a)
a specific proxy which relates to a specific meeting, or
(b)
a continuing proxy for the duration of the special administration.
(8) A proxy is to be treated as a specific proxy for the meeting which is identified in the proxy unless it states that it is a continuing proxy for the duration of the special administration.
(9) A specific proxy must—
(a)
direct the proxy-holder how to act at the meeting by giving specific instructions,
(b)
authorise the proxy-holder to act at the meeting without specific instructions, or
(c)
contain both direction and authorisation.
(10) A continuing proxy must authorise the proxy-holder to attend, speak, vote on or abstain from voting on, or propose resolutions without giving the proxy-holder any specific instructions how to do so.
(11) A continuing proxy may be superseded by a proxy for a specific meeting or withdrawn by a written notice to the administrator.Issue and use of forms
88.—(1) Forms of proxy must be sent out with every notice calling a meeting to be held in the special administration and such form must be a “blank proxy”.
(2) A “blank proxy” is a document which—
(a)
complies with the requirements in this rule,
(b)
when completed with the details specified in paragraph (4) will be a proxy as described in rule 87.
(3) A blank proxy must state that the principal named in the document (when completed) appoints a person who is named or identified as the proxy-holder of the principal.
(4) The specified details are—
(a)
the name and address of the creditor, customer, member or contributory,
(b)
either the name of the proxy-holder or the identification of the proxy-holder (such as the chair of the meeting or the administrator),
(c)
a statement that the proxy is—
(i)
for a specific meeting, which is identified in the proxy, or
(ii)
a continuing proxy for the proceedings,and
(d)
if the proxy is for a specific meeting, instructions as to the extent to which the proxy-holder is directed to vote in a particular way, to abstain or to propose any resolution.
(5) When it is delivered to the principal, a blank proxy must not contain the name or description of any person as proxy-holder, or instructions as to how a proxy-holder is to act.
(6) A blank proxy must have a note to the effect that the proxy may be completed with the name of the person or the chair of the meeting who is to be proxy-holder.
(7) A form of proxy must be authenticated by the principal, or by some person authorised by that principal (either generally or with reference to a particular meeting).
(8) If the form is authenticated by a person other than the principal, the nature of the person’s authority must be stated.Use of proxies at meetings
89.—(1) A proxy for a specific meeting must be delivered to the chair at or before the meeting.
(2) A continuing proxy must be delivered to the administrator and may be exercised by the proxy-holder at any meeting which begins after the proxy is delivered.
(3) A proxy given for a particular meeting may be used at any adjournment of that meeting but if a different proxy is given for use at a resumed meeting, that proxy must be delivered to the chair before the start of the resumed meeting.
(4) Where the administrator holds proxies to be used by the administrator as chair of a meeting, and some other person acts as chair, the other person may use the administrator’s proxies as if that person was the proxy-holder.
(5) Where a proxy directs a proxy-holder to vote for or against a resolution for the nomination or appointment of a person as the administrator, the proxy-holder may, unless the proxy states otherwise, vote for or against (as they think fit) any resolution for the nomination or appointment of that person jointly with another or others.
(6) A proxy-holder may propose any resolution which is one on which the proxy-holder would be entitled to vote if someone else proposed it.
(7) Where a proxy gives specific directions as to voting, this does not, unless the proxy states otherwise, preclude the proxy-holder from voting at their discretion on resolutions put to the meeting which are not dealt with in the proxy.Retention of proxies
90.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), proxies used for voting at any meeting must be retained by the chair of the meeting.

the customers, in the case of proxies used at a meeting of customers or at a meeting of creditors and customers,
(c)
the institution’s members or contributories, in the case of proxies used at a meeting of the institution or of its contributories.
(2) The reference in paragraph (1) to creditors or to customers is to persons who have submitted in writing a claim to be creditors or, as the case may be, customers of the institution, but does not include a person whose claim has been wholly rejected for purposes of voting, dividend or otherwise.
(3) The right of inspection given by this rule is also exercisable by the directors of the institution in special administration.
(4) Any person attending a meeting in the course of the special administration is entitled, immediately before or during the meeting, to inspect proxies or any statement of claim or documentary evidence of debt delivered in accordance with the notice convening the meeting sent or given, in accordance with directions contained in any notice convening the meeting, to the chair of that meeting or to any other person by a creditor, customer, member or contributory for the purpose of that meeting.
(5) This rule is subject to rule 190.Proxy-holder with financial interest
92.—(1) A proxy-holder must not vote in favour of any resolution which would—

directly or indirectly place the proxy-holder, or any associate of the proxy-holder, in a position to receive any remuneration, fees or expenses out of the insolvent estate or the asset pool, or
(b)
fix or change the amount of or the basis of any remuneration, fees or expenses receivable by the proxy-holder or any associate of the proxy-holder from the insolvent estate or the asset pool.
(2) However, a proxy-holder may vote for a resolution described in paragraph (1) if the proxy specifically directs the proxy-holder to vote in that way.

(2) The resolution must have been signed or subscribed (or in the case of an electronic document, authenticated) by or on behalf of the corporation in accordance with the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995(1), and the copy must be certified by the secretary or a director of the corporation to be a true copy.
(3) Nothing in this rule requires the authority of a person to authenticate a proxy on behalf of a principal which is a corporation to be in the form of a resolution of that corporation.
(4) In this rule “authenticated” has the meaning given in the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995.

a creditor has had a claim accepted in whole or in part,
(b)

(4) The obligant may require and obtain at the obligant’s own expense from the creditor an assignation of the debt on payment of the amount of the debt, and on that being done may in respect of the debt submit a claim, and vote and draw a dividend, if otherwise legally entitled to do so.
(5) Paragraph (4) is without prejudice to any right, under any rule of law, of an obligant who has paid the debt.
(6) In this rule an “obligant” includes a cautioner.Amount which may be claimed generally
122.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this rule and rules 123 and 124 a creditor is entitled to claim the accumulated sum of principal and any interest which is due on the debt as at the date on which the institution entered special administration.
(2) If a debt does not depend on a contingency but would not be payable but for the special administration until after the date on which the institution entered special administration, the amount of the claim is to be calculated as if the debt were payable on the date on which the institution entered special administration but subject to the deduction of interest at the rate specified in paragraph (4) from that date until the date for payment of the debt.
(3) In calculating the amount of a creditor’s claim, the creditor must deduct any discount (other than any discount for immediate or early settlement) which is allowable by contract or course of dealing between the creditor and the institution or by the usage of trade.
(4) The rate of interest referred to in paragraph (2) is to be whichever is the greater of—
(a)
the official rate at the date the institution entered special administration, or
(b)
the rate applicable to that debt apart from the special administration.Debts depending on contingency

to the administrator, or

if there is no administrator, to the court,
the administrator or court must put a value on the debt in so far as it is contingent.
(3) Where under paragraph (2) a value is put on the debt—
(a)
the amount in respect of which the creditor is then entitled to claim is to be that value but no more,
(b)
where the contingent debt is an annuity, a cautioner may not then be sued for more than that value.
(4) Any interested person may appeal to the court against a valuation under paragraph (2) by the administrator, and the court may affirm or vary that valuation.Secured debts
124.—(1) In calculating the amount of a secured creditor’s claim the secured creditor is to deduct the value of any security as estimated by the secured creditor.
(2) If the secured creditor surrenders, or undertakes in writing to surrender, a security for the benefit of the institution’s assets, the secured creditor is not required to deduct the value of that security.
(3) The administrator may, at any time after the expiry of twelve weeks from the date on which the institution entered special administration, require a secured creditor at the expense of the institution’s assets to discharge the security or convey or assign it to the administrator on payment to the creditor of the value specified by the creditor.
(4) Where under paragraph (3) the administrator makes payment to the creditor, the amount in respect of which the creditor is then entitled to claim is to be any balance of the creditor’s debt remaining after receipt of such payment.
(5) In calculating the amount of the claim of a creditor whose security has been realised, the creditor must deduct the amount (less the expenses of realisation) which the creditor has received, or is entitled to receive, from the realisation.Claims in a foreign currency
125.—(1) A creditor may state the amount of their claim in a currency other than sterling where—
(a)
the creditor’s claim is constituted by decree or other order made by a court ordering the institution to pay to the creditor a sum expressed in a currency other than sterling, or
(b)
where it is not so constituted, the creditor’s claim arises from a contract or bill of exchange in terms of which payment is or may be required to be made by the institution to the creditor in a currency other than sterling.
(2) Where under paragraph (1) a claim is stated in a currency other than sterling the administrator must convert it into sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the administrator by reference to the exchange rates prevailing in the London market at the close of business on the date on which the institution entered special administration.
(3) On the next occasion when the administrator communicates with the creditors the administrator must advise them of any rate so determined.
(4) A creditor who considers that the rate determined by the administrator is unreasonable may apply to the court.
(5) If on hearing the application the court finds that the rate is unreasonable it may itself determine the rate.
(6) The administrator must place a copy of any court order granted under paragraph (5) in the sederunt book.Administrator to allow inspection of statements of claim
126.  The administrator must, so long as submitted claims are in the administrator’s hands, allow them to be inspected, at all reasonable times on any business day, by any of the following persons—

ordinary debts, that is to say, a debt which is neither a secured debt nor a debt mentioned in any other sub-paragraph of this paragraph,

(ii)
a claim arising by virtue of section 382(1)(a) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000(3) (restitution orders), unless it is also a claim arising by virtue of sub-paragraph (b) of that section (a person who has suffered loss etc.), or
(iii)
in special administration, a claim which by virtue of the IA 1986 (as applied by Regulation 37) or any other enactment is a claim the payment of which is to be postponed.
(3) The expenses of the special administration mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) are payable in the order of priority mentioned in rule 95.

128.—(1) The administrator must make up accounts of the administrator’s intromissions with the institution’s assets in respect of each accounting period.
(2) In this rule, “accounting period” is to be construed as follows—
(a)
the first accounting period is the period of six months beginning with the date on which the institution entered special administration,
(b)
any subsequent accounting period is the period of six months beginning with the end of the last accounting period except that—
(i)
where the administrator and the creditors’ committee agree, or
(ii)
where there is no creditors’ committee, the court determines,
the accounting period is to be such other period beginning with the end of the last accounting period as may be agreed or, as the case may be determined, it is to be that other period.
(3) An agreement or determination under paragraph (2)(b)—
(a)
may be made in respect of one or more than one accounting period,
(b)
may be made before the beginning of the accounting period in relation to which it has effect and, in any event, is not to have effect unless made before the day on which such accounting period would, but for the agreement or determination, have ended,
(c)
may provide for different accounting periods to be of different durations.
(4) The administrator may pay a dividend to secured or preferential creditors or, where the administrator has the permission of the court, to unsecured creditors only if the following conditions are met—
(a)
the administrator has sufficient funds for the purpose,
(b)
the administrator’s statement of proposals, as approved by the creditors under Chapter 3 of Part 3, contains a proposal to make a distribution to the class of creditors in question,
(c)
the payment of a dividend is consistent with the functions and duties of the administrator and any proposals made by the administrator or which the administrator intends to make.
(5) The administrator may pay—
(a)
the expenses of the special administration mentioned in rule 95, other than the administrator’s remuneration, at any time,
(b)
the preferential debts within the meaning of section 386 of IA 1986 at any time but only with the consent of the creditors’ committee or, if there is no creditors’ committee, of the court.
(6) If the administrator—
(a)
is not ready to pay a dividend in respect of an accounting period, or
(b)
considers it would be inappropriate to pay such a dividend because the expenses of doing so would be disproportionate to the amount of the dividend,
the administrator may postpone such payment to a date not later than the time for payment of a dividend in respect of the next accounting period.
(7) Where an appeal is taken under rule 119(5) against the acceptance or rejection of a creditor’s claim, the administrator must at the time of payment of dividends and until the appeal is determined, set aside an amount which would be sufficient, if the determination in the appeal were to provide for the claim being accepted in full, to pay a dividend in respect of that claim.
(8) Where a creditor—
(a)
has failed to produce evidence in support of a claim earlier than eight weeks before the end of an accounting period on being required by the administrator to do so under rule 118,
(b)

The purpose of giving this notice is to permit the director to act in these circumstances where the institution enters (or has entered) special administration without the director committing a criminal offence and, in the case of the carrying on of the business through another company, being personally liable for that company’s debts.
Notice may be given where the person giving the notice is already the director of a company which proposes to adopt a prohibited name.”.Second excepted case

(b)
special administration objectives and procedures apply,
(c)
specific provision is made about how those procedures apply to small institutions,
(d)
the administrator is to pursue the special administration objectives in accordance with the statement of proposals,

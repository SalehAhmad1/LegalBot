26th May 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in Great Britain, amend the Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 (“the 2021 Regulations”), which established the Green Gas Support Scheme (“the GGSS”).
The GGSS is a renewable heat incentive scheme to facilitate and encourage the production of biomethane by anaerobic digestion, for injection into the gas grid. These Regulations correct drafting defects in two provisions in the 2021 Regulations which result in aspects of the GGSS not functioning as intended.
First, these Regulations amend the methodology for adjusting a person’s guaranteed tariff to account for inflation. Adjustments in respect of inflation will now be made to guaranteed tariffs at the start of a financial year by the percentage increase or decrease in the consumer prices index over the previous calendar year.
Second, these Regulations amend the methodology for calculating the estimated total budget commitment so that it more accurately reflects expected future payments for additional biomethane capacity. The estimated total budget commitment is checked against the budget allocation published by the Secretary of State to determine whether there is sufficient budget available to accept new applications to the GGSS.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

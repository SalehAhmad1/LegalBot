The exemptions concern the application of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) in certain types of medical devices and spare parts recovered from and used for the repair or refurbishment of medical devices. The exemptions are granted for a period ending with the date specified in column 6 of the table included in regulation 2(2)(c) of these Regulations.

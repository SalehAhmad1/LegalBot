(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (School Teachers’ Qualification) (England) Regulations 2003 (“the QTS Regulations”) and the Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 2012 (“the Induction Regulations”).
The QTS Regulations set out the requirements which must be satisfied in order to be a qualified teacher in England. The QTS Regulations are amended:
(a)
to provide for teachers who hold the qualification known as “international qualified teacher status” (or iQTS) to be qualified teachers in England (new paragraph 13D of Schedule 2 to the QTS Regulations, as inserted by regulation 3(10) of these Regulations), and
(b)
to set out new requirements to be satisfied by certain teachers who have completed their teacher training outside England (paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 to the QTS Regulations, as amended by regulation 3(4) of these Regulations and new paragraph 13E of that Schedule, as inserted by regulation 3(10) of these Regulations).
These Regulations make related transitional provisions for those who complete their teacher training outside England and have sought to work as a teacher in England before 1st February 2023 (regulation 3(3), (5), (6) and (8) of these Regulations).
Paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 to the QTS Regulations is amended to clarify the institutions in England at which a person may complete their course of initial teacher training to be a qualified teacher (regulation 3(7) of these Regulations).
The Induction Regulations set out the arrangements and requirements for induction periods for teachers who are employed in maintained schools and non-maintained special schools. The Induction Regulations are amended so that the following are exempt from the requirement to complete an induction period before taking up employment in such a school:
(a)
teachers who have successfully completed a probationary period at a Ministry of Defence school which is not in the United Kingdom (paragraph 20 of Schedule 1 to the Induction Regulations, as amended by regulation 4(4) of these Regulations), and
(b)
teachers who are qualified teachers under paragraph 13E of Schedule 2 to the QTS Regulations (which is inserted by these Regulations) and who have at least two years (full-time equivalent) practical teaching experience (new paragraph 25 of Schedule 1 to the Induction Regulations, as inserted by regulation 4(5) of these Regulations).
The Inductions Regulations are also amended so that:
(a)
teachers who become qualified teachers under paragraph 8 or 8A of Schedule 2 to the QTS Regulations on or after 1st February 2023 are exempt from the requirement to complete an induction period only if they have at least two years (full-time equivalent) practical teaching experience (new paragraph 25 of Schedule 1 to the Induction Regulations), and
(b)
teachers who have, or are eligible for, full registration with the General Teaching Council for Scotland are exempt from the requirement to complete an induction period only if they had, or were eligible, for full registration before 1st February 2023 or have completed a probationary period in Scotland (paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 to the Induction Regulations).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or on significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

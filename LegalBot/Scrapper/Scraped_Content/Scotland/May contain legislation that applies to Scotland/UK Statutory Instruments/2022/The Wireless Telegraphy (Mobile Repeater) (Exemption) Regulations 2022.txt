(2) Any oscillations in the uplink frequencies must be detected within 0.3 seconds.
(3) Any oscillations in the downlink frequencies must be detected within one second.
(4) Subject to paragraph (5), if the mobile repeater device detects any oscillations, it must use an anti-oscillation technique which stops those oscillations and continues for at least one minute.

26th May 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations exempt the establishment, installation and use of certain wireless telegraphy stations or apparatus, known as “mobile repeaters”, which comply with certain terms, provisions and limitations, from the requirement to be licensed under section 8(1) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (c.36). These Regulations also revoke the Wireless Telegraphy (Mobile Repeater) (Exemption) Regulations 2018 (c.399) (the “2018 Regulations”).
The mobile repeaters that are exempted are those used indoors and those which are used in motor vehicles.
Mobile repeaters which are used indoors must comply with either Regulations 5 to 12 (in which case, they are more commonly known as provider-specific mobile phone repeaters) or with Regulations 5 to 8 and Regulations 13 to 17 (in which case, they are more commonly known as multi-operator mobile phone repeaters).
Mobile repeaters which are used in motor vehicles must comply with Regulation 18, which incorporates technical specifications and conditions set out in an interface requirement published by the Office of Communications (“Ofcom”). Within the European Union, interface requirements are published in accordance with Article 8.1 of Directive 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on the market of radio equipment. The interface requirements are published by Ofcom and available to the public on its official website at https://www.ofcom.org.uk/ and from its library at Riverside House, 2a Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 9HA.
The ETSI standards referred to in the Regulations are European Union harmonised standards and are available to the public from the official website of the European Union at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/oj/direct-access.html or from the EU Bookshop (as managed by the Publications Office of the European Union) by emailing: bookshop@publications.europa.eu, or from the Publications Office of the European Union at 2 rue Mercier, 2985 Luxembourg, Luxembourg. The ETSI standards themselves are available to the public from ETSI on their website at http://www.etsi.org or from the ETSI Secretariat at 650 Route des Lucioles, 06560 Valbonne, Sophia-Antipolis CEDEX, France (Tel: +33 4 92 94 42 00).
A full regulatory impact assessment of the effect of these Regulations is available to the public from Ofcom’s website at http://www.ofcom.org.uk or from the Ofcom library at Riverside House, 2a Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 9HA. Copies of this assessment have also been placed in the library of the House of Commons.

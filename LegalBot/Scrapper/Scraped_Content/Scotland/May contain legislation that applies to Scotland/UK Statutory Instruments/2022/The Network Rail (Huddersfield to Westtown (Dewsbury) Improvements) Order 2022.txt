(e)
where Network Rail could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that Network Rail had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that Network Rail had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.

MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS OR IMPOSITION OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply with the necessary modifications as respects compensation in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) —Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the following modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A)(1) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enter on land for the purposes of exercising a right or enforcing a restrictive covenant in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 12 to the Network Rail (Huddersfield to Westtown (Dewsbury) Improvements) Order 2022 (“the 2022 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 12 to the 2022 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enter on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that covenant.”
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(2) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for the words “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for the words “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 27 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 26 (power to acquire land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant, under article 29(1), (2), (4) or (5) (power to acquire new rights), article 30 (power to acquire ground anchor rights) and article 31 (power to acquire subsoil and imposition of restrictive covenants)—
(a)
with the modification specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in the case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or imposition of the restrictive covenant, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restriction, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 27), it has power, exercisable in the equivalent circumstances and subject to the equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(3) (unauthorised entry) and 13 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(4) (tenants at will etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 27(7) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or to enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or a restrictive covenant affecting the whole or part of a house, building or factory.
(2) But see articles 30(3) (power to acquire ground anchor rights), 31(4) (power to acquire subsoil and imposition of restrictive covenants) and 32(4) (power to acquire subsoil or airspace only) of the Network Rail (Huddersfield to Westtown (Dewsbury) Improvements) Order 2022, which exclude acquisition with respect to the acquisition of ground anchor rights and imposition of restrictive covenants only, the acquisition of subsoil and imposition of restrictive covenants only and the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of its decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

SCHEDULE 18
PROVISIONS RELATING TO STATUTORY UNDERTAKERS ETC.
Apparatus of statutory undertakers etc. on land acquired
1.—(1) Sections 271 to 274(1) (extinguishment of rights of statutory undertakers etc.) of the 1990 Act apply in relation to any land acquired or appropriated by Network Rail under this Order subject to the following provisions of this paragraph; and all such other provisions of that Act as apply for the purposes of those provisions (including sections 275 to 278, which contain provisions consequential on the extinguishment of any rights under sections 271 and 272, and sections 279(2) to (4), 280 and 282(2), which provide for the payment of compensation) have effect accordingly.
(2) In the provisions of the 1990 Act, as applied by sub-paragraph (1), references to the appropriate Minister are references to the Secretary of State.
(3) Where any apparatus of public utility undertakers or of a public communications provider is removed in pursuance of a notice or order given or made under section 271, 272 or 273 of the 1990 Act, as applied by sub-paragraph (1), any person who is the owner or occupier of premises to which a supply was given from that apparatus is entitled to recover from Network Rail compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of effecting a connection between the premises and any other apparatus from which a supply is given.
(4) Sub-paragraph (3) does not apply in the case of the removal of a public sewer but where such a sewer is removed in pursuance of such a notice or order as is mentioned in that paragraph, any person who is—
(a)
the owner or occupier of premises the drains of which communicated with that sewer; or
(b)
the owner of a private sewer which communicated with that sewer,
is entitled to recover from Network Rail compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of making the drain or sewer belonging to that person communicate with any other public sewer or with a private sewerage disposal plant.
(5) The provisions of the 1990 Act mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), as applied by that sub-paragraph, do not have effect in relation to apparatus as respects which paragraph (2) or Part 3 of the 1991 Act applies.
(6) Nothing in this paragraph affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and a public communications provider or public utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Network Rail on the date on which the Order is made.
(7) In this paragraph—
“public communications provider” has the same meaning as in section 151(1) of the 2003 Act; and
“public utility undertaker” has the same meaning as in the 1980 Act(3).
Apparatus of statutory undertakers etc. in stopped up streets
2.—(1) Where a street is stopped up under article 14 (stopping up of streets) any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, along or across the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus, subject to the provisions of this paragraph, as if this Order had not been made.
(2) Where a street is stopped up under article 14 any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, over, along or across the street may, and if reasonably requested to do so by Network Rail must—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in that other position.
(3) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must pay to any statutory utility an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the utility in or in connection with—
(a)
the execution of the relocation works required in consequence of the stopping up of the street; and
(b)
the doing of any other work or thing rendered necessary by the execution of the relocation works.
(4) If in the course of the execution of relocation works under sub-paragraph (2)—
(a)
apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(6) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a statutory utility in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) (and having regard, where relevant, to sub-paragraph (4)) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(7) Sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) do not apply where the authorised works constitute major transport works for the purposes of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act, but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of cost of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section; and
(b)
the allowable costs are to be borne by Network Rail and the statutory utility in such proportions as may be prescribed by any such regulations.
(8) Nothing in this paragraph affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and a statutory utility in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Network Rail on the date on which the Order is made.
(9) In this paragraph—
(a)
“apparatus” has the same meaning as in Part 3 of the 1991 Act;
(b)
“relocation works” means work executed, or apparatus provided, under sub-paragraph (2); and
(c)
“statutory utility” means a statutory undertaker for the purposes of the 1980 Act or a public communications provider as defined in paragraph 1(7).
Railway and navigation undertakings
3.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the powers under article 13 (power to execute street works) to break up or open a street are not exercisable where the street, not being a highway maintainable at public expense (within the meaning of the 1980 Act) is under the control or management of, or is maintainable by, railway undertakers or a navigation authority except with the consent of the undertakers or authority.
(2) Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply to the carrying out under this Order of emergency works, within the meaning of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
(3) A consent given for the purpose of sub-paragraph (1) may be made subject to such reasonable conditions as may be specified by the person giving it but must not be unreasonably withheld.
(4) In this paragraph “navigation authority” means any person who has a duty or power under any enactment to work, maintain, conserve, improve or control any canal or other inland navigation, navigable river, estuary, harbour or dock.
(5) Nothing in this paragraph affects the provision of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and a railway undertaker or a navigation authority in respect of any street to which sub-paragraph (1) applies which have effect on the date on which this Order is made.

5.  Without affecting any provision in this Order or anything shown on the deposited plans Network Rail must not acquire any apparatus other than by agreement.
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, Network Rail acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of an undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in question.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Network Rail requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the undertaker in question and Network Rail within 21 days of the service of a notice under sub-paragraph (2) or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration).
(4) In any case where alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed under sub-paragraph (2), or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus, Network Rail must, subject to sub-paragraph (5), afford to the undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of Network Rail and for the subsequent maintenance of that apparatus.
(5) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of Network Rail, or Network Rail is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (4) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Network Rail, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(6) The undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration), and after the grant to the undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (4) or (5), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by Network Rail to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(7) Without affecting anything in sub-paragraph (6), if Network Rail gives notice in writing to the undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work to which this sub-paragraph applies, that work, instead of being executed by the undertaker, must be executed by Network Rail without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker.
(8) Sub-paragraph (7) applies to any part of any work necessary in connection with construction of alternative apparatus, or the removal of apparatus required to be removed, as will take place in any land of Network Rail.
(9) Nothing in sub-paragraph (7) authorises Network Rail to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail affords to an undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of Network Rail of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Network Rail and the undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of the alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of Network Rail, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Network Rail in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Network Rail to that undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2), Network Rail must submit to the undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and an officer of the undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description are submitted to it under sub-paragraph (1).
(4) If an undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by Network Rail, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to Network Rail of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Network Rail from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) Network Rail is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
9.  If in consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed Network Rail must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable the undertaker to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must repay to an undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Any dispute as to whether a financial benefit is conferred in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or as to the amount of such financial benefit which cannot be agreed is to be determined in accordance with article 57 (arbitration).
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of an undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any undertaker, Network Rail must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on Network Rail with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of an undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) An undertaker must give Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of Network Rail, which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
12.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provision of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and an undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Network Rail on the date on which this Order is made.

Subject to paragraph 24, if by reason of the construction of any specified work or of the failure of any such work the efficiency of any drainage work for flood defence purposes is impaired, or that drainage work is otherwise damaged, such impairment or damage must be made good by Network Rail to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agency and if Network Rail fails to do so, the Agency may make good the same and recover from Network Rail the expense reasonably incurred by it in so doing.
23.—(1) Network Rail must take all such measures as may be reasonably practicable to prevent any interruption of the free passage of fish in the fishery during the construction of any specified work.
(2) If by reason of—
(a)
the construction of any specified work; or
(b)
the failure of any such work,
damage to the fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the Agency may serve notice on Network Rail requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage, or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.
(3) Subject to paragraph 24, if within such time as may be reasonably practicable for that purpose after the receipt of written notice from the Agency of any damage or expected damage to a fishery, Network Rail fails to take such steps as are described in sub-paragraph (2), the Agency may take those steps and may recover from Network Rail the expense reasonably incurred by it in doing so.
(4) Subject to paragraph 24, in any case where immediate action by the Agency is reasonably required in order to secure that the risk of damage to the fishery is avoided or reduced, the Agency may take such steps as are reasonable for the purpose, and may recover from Network Rail the reasonable cost of so doing provided that notice specifying those steps is served on Network Rail as soon as reasonably practicable after the Agency has taken, or commenced to take, the steps specified in the notice.
24.  Nothing in paragraphs 20(4), 21(3), 22, 23(3) and 23(4) authorises the Agency to execute works on or affecting an operational railway forming part of Network Rail’s network without the prior consent in writing of Network Rail, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
25.  If by reason of the construction of any specified work the Agency’s access to flood defences or equipment maintained by the Agency for flood defence purposes is materially obstructed, Network Rail must as soon as reasonably practicable provide such alternative means of access as will (so far as reasonably practicable) allow the Agency to maintain the flood defence or use the equipment no less effectively than was possible before the obstruction.
26.  Network Rail must indemnify the Agency in respect of all costs, charges and expenses which the Agency may reasonably incur or have to pay or which it may sustain—
(a)
in the examination or approval of plans under this Part of this Schedule; and
(b)
in the inspection of the construction of the specified works or any protective works required by the Agency under this Part of this Schedule.
27.—(1) Without affecting the other provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail must indemnify the Agency from all claims, demands, proceedings, costs, damages, expenses or loss, which may be made or taken against, recovered from, or incurred by, the Agency by reason of—
(a)
any damage to any drainage work so as to impair its efficiency for the purposes of flood defence;
(b)
any damage to the fishery;
(c)
any raising or lowering of the water table in land adjoining the authorised works or any sewers, drains and watercourses;
(d)
any flooding or increased flooding of any such lands; or
(e)
inadequate water quality in any watercourse or other surface waters or in any groundwater,
which is caused by the construction of any of the specified works or any act or omission of Network Rail, its contractors, agents or employees whilst engaged upon the work.
(2) The Agency must give to Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise may be made without the agreement of Network Rail which agreement must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
28.  The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done by Network Rail in accordance with a plan approved or deemed to be approved by the Agency, or to its satisfaction, or in accordance with any directions or award of an arbitrator, does not relieve Network Rail from any liability under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
29.  Any dispute arising between Network Rail and the Agency under this Part of this Schedule, if the parties agree, is to be determined by arbitration under article 57 (arbitration), but otherwise is to be determined by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Transport acting jointly on a reference to them by Network Rail or the Agency, after notice in writing by one to the other.

If by reason of the construction of any specified work or of the failure of any such work the efficiency of any drainage work for flood defence purposes is impaired, or that drainage work is otherwise damaged, such impairment or damage must be made good by Network Rail to the reasonable satisfaction of the lead local flood authority and if Network Rail fails to do so, the lead local flood authority may make good the impairment or damage and recover from Network Rail the expense reasonably incurred by it in so doing.
36.  Network Rail must pay all costs, charges and expenses which the lead local flood authority may reasonably incur or have to pay—
(a)
in the examination or approval of plans under this Part of this Schedule; and
(b)
in the inspection of the construction of the specified works or any protective works required by the lead local flood authority under this Part of this Schedule.
37.  The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done by Network Rail in accordance with a plan approved or deemed to be approved by the lead local flood authority, or to its satisfaction, or in accordance with any directions or award of an arbitrator, does not relieve Network Rail from any liability under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
38.  Any dispute arising between Network Rail and the lead local flood authority under this Part of this Schedule, if the parties agree, is to be determined by arbitration under article 57 (arbitration).

“the waterways” means the Huddersfield Broad Canal and the Calder and Hebble Navigation, and includes any works, lands or premises belonging to the Trust, or under its management or control, that are held and used by the Trust in connection with the waterways.
40.  Network Rail must not under the powers conferred by this Order acquire compulsorily any land of the Trust or any easement or other right over such land, other than such land or easements or other rights over such land, as is reasonably necessary for, or in connection with, the construction, maintenance or operation of the authorised works.
41.—(1) Network Rail must not in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order permanently obstruct or interfere with pedestrian or vehicular access to the waterways unless such permanent obstruction or interference with such access is with the consent of the Trust.
(2) Nothing in article 22 (discharge of water) authorises Network Rail—
(a)
to discharge any water directly or indirectly into the relevant part of the waterway; or
(b)
to carry out any works to, or make any opening in, or otherwise interfere with, the relevant part of the waterway (including the banks and bed thereof),
except with the consent of the Trust and in accordance with plans approved by, and under the supervision (if given) of, the engineer.
(3) Network Rail must not exercise the powers conferred by article 23 (protective works to buildings, roads and apparatus of a statutory undertaker) in relation to any building forming part of the waterways, or situated on land or property of the Trust forming part of the waterways, except with the consent of the Trust.
(4) Network Rail must not exercise the powers conferred by article 24 (power to survey and investigate land) or the powers conferred by section 11(3) of the 1965 Act in relation to the waterways except with the consent of the Trust.
(5) Network Rail must not exercise the powers conferred by section 271 or 272 of the 1990 Act, as applied by Schedule 18 to this Order, so as to permanently divert any right of access to the waterways, but any such right of access may be permanently diverted with the consent of the Trust.
(6) The consent of the Trust under any of sub-paragraphs (1), (3), (4) and (5) and the approval of plans under sub-paragraph (2) must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed but may be given subject to reasonable conditions which in the case of article 22 (discharge of water) may include conditions—
(a)
specifying the maximum volume of water which may be discharged in any period; and
(b)
authorising the Trust on giving reasonable notice (except in an emergency, when the Trust may require immediate suspension) to Network Rail to require Network Rail to suspend the discharge of water or reduce the flow of water where this is necessary by reason of any operational requirement of the Trust and where a reasonable alternative is available to enable Network Rail to discharge the water in question during the period of the suspension.
42.  Network Rail must not use any land or property of the Trust forming part of the waterways for the passage or siting of vehicles, plant or machinery employed in the construction of the specified work other than—
(a)
with the consent in writing of the engineer whose consent must not be unreasonably withheld; and
(b)
subject to compliance with such reasonable requirements as the engineer may from time to time specify—
(i)
for the prevention of detriment; or
(ii)
in order to avoid or reduce any inconvenience to the Trust, its officers and agents and all other persons lawfully on such land or property.
43.  If in consequence of or in connection with the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order any part of a way over land forming part of the waterways or any public right of way giving access to the waterways (“the closed section”) is temporarily closed to persons on foot or on cycles and there is no way which provides a reasonable alternative, Network Rail must to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trust, provide in substitution as sufficient and convenient a way as is reasonably practicable between the points of commencement and termination of the closed section for such time as the closure continues.
44.  Where so required by the engineer Network Rail must, to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer, fence off any specified work or protective work or take such other steps as the engineer may require to be taken for the purpose of separating a specified work or a protective work from the waterways, whether on a temporary or permanent basis or both.
45.—(1) Before the commencement of the initial construction of any part of the specified works and again following completion of the specified works Network Rail must bear the reasonable costs of the carrying out, by a qualified surveyor or engineer (“the surveyor”) to be approved by the Trust and Network Rail, of surveys (“the surveys”) of so much of the waterways and of any land and existing works of Network Rail which may provide support for the waterways as will or may be affected by the specified works.
(2) For the purposes of the surveys Network Rail must—
(a)
on being given reasonable notice (save in case of emergency, when immediate access must be afforded) afford reasonable facilities to the surveyor for access to the site of the specified works and to any land and existing works of Network Rail which may provide support for the waterways as will or may be affected by the specified works; and
(b)
supply the surveyor as soon as reasonably practicable with all such information as the surveyor may reasonably require with regard to such land and existing works of Network Rail and to the specified works or the method of their construction.
(3) The reasonable costs of the surveys must include the costs of any dewatering or reduction of the water level of any part of the waterways (where reasonably required) which may be effected to facilitate the carrying out of the surveys and the provisions of this Part of the Schedule apply with all necessary modifications to any such dewatering or reduction in the water level as though the same were specified works.
(4) Copies of the reports of the surveys must be provided to both the Trust and Network Rail.
46.—(1) Network Rail must, before commencing construction of any specified work, including any temporary works, supply to the Trust proper and sufficient plans of that work and such further particulars available to it as the Trust may within 14 days of the submission of the plans reasonably require for the approval of the engineer and must not commence such construction of any specified work until plans of that work have been approved in writing by the engineer or settled by arbitration.
(2) The approval of the engineer under sub-paragraph (1) must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, if and within 56 days after such plans (including any other particulars reasonably required under sub-paragraph (1)) have been supplied to the Trust the engineer has not intimated disapproval of those plans and the grounds of disapproval the engineer is deemed to have approved the plans as submitted.
(3) When signifying his approval of the plans the engineer may specify—
(a)
any protective work (whether temporary or permanent); and
(b)
such other requirements as may be reasonably necessary to prevent detriment,
and such protective work must be constructed by the Trust or (if the Trust so desires) by Network Rail with all reasonable dispatch and Network Rail must not commence the construction of any specified work until the engineer has notified Network Rail that the protective work has been completed to the engineer’s reasonable satisfaction.
47.  Without affecting its obligations under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule Network Rail must consult the Trust on―
(a)
the design and appearance of the specified works, including the materials to be used for their construction; and
(b)
the environmental effects of the specified works;
and must have regard to such views as may be expressed by the Trust, to the extent that these accord with the requirements of the local planning authority in response to such consultation pursuant, in particular, to the requirements imposed on the Trust by section 22 (general environmental and recreational duties) of the British Waterways Act 1995(6) and to the interest of the Trust in preserving and enhancing the environment of the relevant part of the waterway.
48.  Network Rail must give to the engineer 56 days’ notice of its intention to commence the construction of any of the specified works or protective works, or, in the case of repair carried out in an emergency, such notice as may be reasonably practicable so that, in particular, the Trust may where appropriate arrange for the publication of notices bringing those works to the attention of users of the waterways.
49.  Network Rail must provide and maintain at its own expense in the vicinity of any specified works or protective work such temporary lighting and such signal lights for the control of navigation as the engineer may reasonably require during the construction or failure of the specified work or protective work.
50.  Any specified works must, when commenced, be constructed―
(a)
without unnecessary delay in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to have been approved or settled in accordance with this Schedule and with any requirements made under paragraph 46(3)(b);
(b)
under the supervision (if given) and, in the case of any specified work which directly and physically affects the relevant part of the waterway, to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer;
(c)
in such manner as to cause as little detriment as is reasonably practicable; and
(d)
in such manner as to cause as little inconvenience as is reasonably practicable to the Trust, its officers and agents and all other persons lawfully using the waterways.
51.—(1) Any pile, stump or other obstruction which becomes exposed in consequence of the construction of a specified work must be removed by Network Rail or, if it is not reasonably practicable to remove it, must be cut off at such level below the bed of the waterways as the Trust may direct.
(2) If Network Rail fails to remove any such pile, stump or other obstruction within 28 days after receipt of written notice from the Trust requiring the removal, the Trust may carry out the removal and recover its costs from Network Rail.
52.  Network Rail must not in the course of constructing any specified work or protective work or otherwise in connection with the works do or permit anything which may result in the pollution of the waterways or the deposit of materials in the waterways and must take such steps as the engineer may reasonably require to avoid or make good any breach of its obligations under this paragraph; but this provision does not prevent Network Rail from carrying out works within the waterways.
53.—(1) Network Rail must at all times on being given reasonable notice allow reasonable facilities to the engineer for access to any specified work during its construction; but such facilities for access are subject to Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for ensuring the safety of the railway and of the engineer and other persons working on the railway.
(2) Network Rail must supply the engineer with all such information as the engineer may reasonably require with regard to any specified work or the method of constructing it.
54.—(1) If during the construction of a specified work or during a period of 24 months after the completion of a specified work any alterations or additions, either permanent or temporary, to the waterways are reasonably necessary in consequence of the construction of the specified work in order to avoid detriment, and the Trust gives to Network Rail reasonable notice of its intention to carry out such alterations or additions (which must be specified in the notice), Network Rail must pay to the Trust the reasonable cost of those alterations or additions including, in respect of any such alterations and additions as are to be permanent, a capitalised sum representing the increase of the costs which may be expected to be reasonably incurred by the Trust in maintaining, working and, when necessary, renewing any such alterations or additions.
(2) If the cost of maintaining, working or renewing the waterways is reduced in consequence of any such alterations or additions a capitalised sum representing such saving must be set off against any sum payable by Network Rail to the Trust under this paragraph.
55.—(1) Network Rail must, upon completion of any part of any permanent specified work, remove as soon as practicable any temporary works constructed and materials for temporary works placed in, on, over or under the waterways in connection with that part of the specified work.
(2) All temporary works must be removed to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer, and in the construction, maintenance and removal of such works Network Rail must not cause unavoidable detriment.
56.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in the Trust, the Trust gives notice to Network Rail informing it that the state of maintenance of the work appears to be such that the work is causing, or is likely to cause, detriment, Network Rail must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put the work in such state of maintenance as not to cause such detriment.
57.  Any additional expenses which the Trust may reasonably incur in maintaining the waterways under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such maintenance has been given to Network Rail, be repaid by Network Rail to the Trust.
58.  Network Rail must repay to the Trust all fees, costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred by the Trust―
(a)
in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 46(3)(a) including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by Network Rail and the supervision by the engineer of the construction or repair of any specified work and any protective work;
(c)
in respect of the employment during the period of the initial construction of any specified work or protective work of any inspectors, watchkeepers and other persons whom it is reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, watching and lighting any part of the waterways and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of the specified work or any protective work; and
(d)
in bringing the specified work or any protective work to the notice of users of the waterways.
59.—(1) If any detriment is caused by the construction or failure of any specified work or protective work, Network Rail (if so required by the Trust) must make good such detriment and must pay to the Trust all reasonable expenses to which the Trust may be put, and compensation for any loss which the Trust may sustain, in making good or otherwise by reason of the detriment.
(2) Network Rail is responsible for and must make good to the Trust all costs, charges, damages, expenses and losses not otherwise provided for in this Part of this Schedule which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by the Trust―
(a)
by reason of the construction of any specified work or a protective work or the failure of such a work; or
(b)
by reason of any act or omission of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged upon the construction of any specified work or of a protective work,
and subject to sub-paragraph (4) Network Rail must effectively indemnify and hold harmless the Trust from and against all claims and demands arising out of any of the matters referred to in paragraphs(a) and (b).
(3) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by the Trust on behalf of Network Rail or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision or in accordance with any directions or awards of an arbitrator does not (if it was done without negligence on the part of the Trust or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse Network Rail from any liability under the provisions of this paragraph.
(4) The Trust must give Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand is to be made without the prior consent of Network Rail.
60.  Where under any provision of this Part of this Schedule the Trust or Network Rail (as the case may be) is entitled to a capitalised sum, it must provide such details of the formula by which the sum is calculated as may reasonably be requested by the party required to pay the sum.
61.  Except as provided by this Order, nothing in this Order is to prejudice or derogate from the estates, rights, interests, privileges, liberties or franchises of the Trust or alter or diminish any power, authority or jurisdiction vested in the Trust at the making of this Order.
62.  Any difference arising between Network Rail and the Trust under this Schedule (other than a difference as to the meaning or construction of this Schedule) is to be referred to and settled by arbitration in accordance with article 57 (arbitration).
63.  Nothing in this Part of the Schedule affects the provision of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and the Trust in respect of the waterways or any land and existing works of Network Rail adjacent to, under or over the waterways which have effect on the date on which this Order is made.

Table 1
Interpretative notes
“multi-data-stream processing” refers to the “microprogram” or equipment architecture technique that permits simultaneous processing of two or more data sequences under the control of one or more instruction sequences by means such as:
Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architectures such as vector or array processors;
Multiple Single Instruction Multiple Data (MSIMD) architectures;
Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) architectures, including those that are tightly coupled, closely coupled or loosely coupled;
structured arrays of processing elements, including systolic arrays.
“data signalling rate” means the rate, as defined in International Telecommunications Union Recommendation 53-36, taking into account that, for non-binary modulation, baud and bit per second are not equal.
Bits for coding, checking and synchronization functions are to be included.
When determining the “data signalling rate”, servicing and administrative channels shall be excluded.
It is the maximum one-way rate, i.e., the maximum rate in either transmission or reception.
“spectral efficiency” is a figure of merit parametrized to characterize the efficiency of transmission system that uses complex modulation schemes such as QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation), Trellis coding, QSPK (Q-phased shift key), etc.. It is defined as the Digital transfer rate (bits/second) divided by 6dB spectrum bandwidth (Hz).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) (“the Sanctions Act”) to amend the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/600) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
Part 2 adds new purposes and designation criteria to the 2019 Regulations, targeting role of the Government of Belarus in supporting Russia’s actions in respect of Ukraine. Part 2 also introduces a power to designate persons by description and makes related changes to designation provisions, including reflecting amendments made to the Sanctions Act by the Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022 (c. 10).
Part 3 widens the financial sanctions relating to Belarus. Existing restrictions on dealing with financial instruments and providing loans are extended to a broader range of transferable securities, money market instruments, loans and credit. Part 3 also introduces a new prohibition on providing financial services for the purpose of foreign exchange reserve and asset management of the Central Bank of Belarus and the Ministry of Finance of Belarus and related persons.
Part 4 widens trade sanctions relating to Belarus. New export restrictions are imposed on goods and technology relating to critical industry, quantum computing and oil refining, and luxury goods, while prohibitions are widened in relation to dual-use goods and technology. New import restrictions are imposed on mineral products, arms and related materiel, iron and steel. A range of related trade activities are prohibited, including technical assistance and financial services relating to certain other prohibited trade activities, and enabling or facilitating military activities. An existing prohibition on providing technical assistance to designated persons in relation to aircraft is widened to include technical assistance provided in relation to ships.
Part 5 adds new aircraft and shipping sanctions. The current aircraft restrictions are widened so that it will now be an offence for certain Belarus-related aircraft to land in, or overfly, the UK, and for such aircraft to be registered in the UK. Part 5 also adds shipping restrictions, prohibiting certain Belarus-related or other specified ships from entering UK ports or being registered in the UK, and providing powers to the Secretary of State to direct the movement and detention of such ships.
Part 6 deals with exceptions and licencing powers. New exceptions in respect of the new trade provisions are included for travellers, diplomatic posts, international organisations, consumer communication devices and software, and for emergencies.
Parts 7 to 9 make related changes to information and enforcement powers, to Schedules, and to other legislation.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector has been published alongside these Regulations and is available from legislation.gov.uk or from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, King Charles Street, London SW1A 2AH.

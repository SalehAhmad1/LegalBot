(This note is not part of the Order)
The Sovereign Grant Act 2011 (“the Act”) makes provision for the payment of a Sovereign Grant to the Sovereign each financial year. The purpose of the Sovereign Grant for a financial year is to provide resources for use for that year by the Royal Household in support of the Sovereign’s official duties.
The Sovereign Grant provisions (sections 1 to 9, 11 and 12 of the Act) cease to have effect 6 months after the death of the Sovereign unless alternative provision is made by an Order in Council within six months of the new reign.
This Order provides that, instead of expiring in accordance with section 16(1) of the Act, the Sovereign Grant provisions expire 6 months after the end of the present reign.

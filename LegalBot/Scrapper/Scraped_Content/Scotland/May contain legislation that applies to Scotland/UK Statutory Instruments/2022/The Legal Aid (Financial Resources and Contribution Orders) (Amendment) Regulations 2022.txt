(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument amends regulations made under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (c. 10) which deal with an individual’s financial eligibility for criminal and civil legal aid and the liability of an individual to pay a contribution towards the cost of criminal legal services received.
Regulation 2 amends the Civil Legal Aid (Financial Resources and Payment for Services) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/480), regulation 3 amends the Criminal Legal Aid (Financial Resources) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/471) and regulation 4 amends the Criminal Legal Aid (Contribution Orders) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/483).
The amendments provide that in the assessment of an individual’s income and capital resources, certain payments made under the Social Security (Additional Payments) Act 2022 (c. 38) and the Energy Prices Act 2022 (c. 44) must be disregarded. The effect of the amendments is that the receipt of the aforementioned payments will not impact on an individual’s financial eligibility for legal aid, or liability to pay a contribution towards the cost of criminal legal services.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

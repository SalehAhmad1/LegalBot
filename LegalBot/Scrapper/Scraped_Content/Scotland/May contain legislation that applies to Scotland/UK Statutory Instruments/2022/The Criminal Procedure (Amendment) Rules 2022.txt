The provisions listed in section 24 of the 2020 Act include section 70 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002(10). Under that section, if a magistrates’ court commits a defendant to the Crown Court so that a confiscation order can be considered then the court also may commit the defendant to the Crown Court to be dealt with there for any other offence of which the defendant has been convicted and with which the magistrates’ court otherwise could deal. Under section 71 of the 2002 Act, the Crown Court may deal with the defendant in any way in which it could have done if the defendant had been convicted in that court, unless the magistrates’ court did not make the statement to which section 70(5) refers.

(b)
for paragraph (1) substitute—
“(1) This rule authorises the Crown Court, in addition to its other powers, to order a party to pay another party’s costs in restraint or receivership proceedings.

(e)
after paragraph (9), as renumbered, insert—

(a)
in rule 42.8 (Notice of determination)—
(i)
for the heading to the rule substitute “Notice of determination and renewal of application for permission to appeal”,
(ii)
in paragraph (1), for “This rule applies” substitute “Paragraphs (2) and (3) of this rule apply”,
(iii)
in paragraph (3), for the words from “a court officer” to the end substitute “the Crown Court officer and the court officer for the magistrates’ court responsible for enforcing any confiscation order which the Crown Court has made (the ‘enforcing court’)”, and
(iv)
after paragraph (3) insert—
“(4) Paragraphs (5) and (6) of this rule apply where—
(a)
a single judge has refused an application for permission to appeal under section 31 of the 2002 Act(1), and
(b)
the appellant renews that application, in time or with an application to extend the time within which to renew.
(5) The Registrar must, as soon as practicable, notify the court officer for the enforcing court, if any, of the service of that renewed application.
(6) Unless a single judge, the Court of Appeal or the enforcing court otherwise directs, pending disposal of the renewed application the court officer for the enforcing court must withhold the payment of any sum not yet paid—
(a)
which under section 13(6) of the 2002 Act(2) was directed to be paid out of sums recovered under a confiscation order, and
(b)
the payment of which is suspended pending appeal.
[Note. See also rule 42.11 (Notice of appeal) under which (i) the Registrar must notify the court officer for the enforcing court of the service of a notice of appeal, and (ii) that court officer must notify any person whose entitlement to payment of a sum is suspended by that appeal.
Under section 13 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, if the Crown Court makes a confiscation order and one or more priority orders, as defined in that section, against the same defendant in the same proceedings then in some circumstances the court must direct that part or all of the priority order must be paid out of sums recovered under the confiscation order.
A compensation order under section 134 of the Sentencing Act 2020(3) is such a priority order. Under section 141(1) of the 2020 Act, a person in whose favour a compensation order is made is not entitled to receive the amount due until there is no further possibility of the order being varied or set aside on appeal (disregarding any power to grant leave to appeal out of time). Under section 141(2) of the 2020 Act, Criminal Procedure Rules may make provision about the way in which the enforcing court is to deal with money paid in satisfaction of a compensation order where the entitlement of the person in whose favour it was made is suspended.]”;

(i)
holding an interest in property in which the Crown Court determined the extent of the defendant’s interest under section 10A of the 2002 Act(4), and
(ii)
who is neither the defendant nor the appellant.”,
(iii)
in paragraph (2), for the words before sub-paragraph (a) substitute “When a notice of appeal is served on a respondent defendant, or other person under paragraph (1)(d), it must be accompanied by a respondent’s notice in the form set out in the Practice Direction for the respondent to complete and a notice which”,
(iv)
in paragraph (2), in each of sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (e) for “defendant” substitute “respondent” in each place it occurs and in sub-paragraph (d) for “defendant’s” substitute “respondent’s”,
(v)
in paragraph (3), for “the defendant in accordance with paragraph (1)” substitute “each respondent”, and
(vi)
after paragraph (3) insert—

(c)
in rule 42.12 (Respondent’s notice), for “defendant” substitute “respondent” in each place it occurs and in paragraph (2)(b) for “defendant’s” substitute “respondent’s”;
(d)
in rule 42.13 (Amendment and abandonment of appeal), for paragraphs (2) and (3) substitute—
“(2) Where the appellant serves a notice abandoning an appeal under paragraph (1), the appellant must send a copy of it to—
(a)
each respondent served with the notice of appeal;
(b)
the Crown Court officer; and
(c)
the court officer for the magistrates’ court responsible for enforcing any confiscation order which the Crown Court has made.
(3) Where the appellant serves a notice amending a notice of appeal under paragraph (1), the appellant must send a copy of it to each respondent served with the notice of appeal.”; and

Part 9 New rule 9.15 is added explicitly to require an opinion by a magistrates’ court under the legislation to which the new rule refers, which opinion affects the powers of the Crown Court when a defendant is committed there for sentence.

Part 24 Rule 24.8 is amended to encourage prompt entry of any written guilty plea that the defendant may wish to make where that rule applies.

Part 25 Rule 25.14 is amended to encourage written as well as oral directions to jurors.
Part 28 The heading to the Part and rule 28.10 are amended, and new rule 28.12 is added, explicitly to acknowledge (i) the magistrates’ court’s powers under the legislation to which the new rule refers, and (ii) the Crown Court’s procedure and sentencing powers when a defendant is committed there for sentence.

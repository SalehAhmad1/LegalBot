(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Criminal Legal Aid (Remuneration) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/848) (“the 2022 Regulations”). The 2022 Regulations amended the Criminal Legal Aid (Remuneration) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/435) (“the Remuneration Regulations”) which make provision for the remuneration of advice, assistance and representation made available under sections 13, 15 and 16 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (c. 10).
The 2022 Regulations introduced amendments to Schedule 1 to 6 to the Remuneration Regulations to provide an increase to various fees within the Remuneration Regulations by 15%.
These Regulations amend four fees within Schedule 3 to the 2022 Regulations, which had not been increased by the correct amount.

26th April 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Under section 340A(1) and (2) of the Armed Forces Act 2006 (c. 52) (“the Act”), a person subject to service law, or who has ceased to be subject to service law, who thinks they have been wronged in any matter relating to their service, may make a service complaint about the matter. Under section 340H(1) of the Act the complainant may apply to the Service Complaints Ombudsman to investigate their complaint or related maladministration. The Armed Forces Act 2021 (c. 35) amended the date from which the minimum period to apply to the Service Complaints Ombudsman for an investigation under section 340H(1)(a) or (b) of the Act is calculated.
These Regulations amend the Armed Forces (Service Complaints Ombudsman Investigations) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1956) (“the 2015 Regulations”), which make provision about Ombudsman investigations, including the procedure to be followed.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 4 of the 2015 Regulations which sets out the time period within which an application must be made to the Service Complaints Ombudsman to investigate a service complaint that has been finally determined or related maladministration in the handling of such a complaint. The amendments reflect measures implemented through the Armed Forces (Services Complaints) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 which limit the grounds upon which an appeal against a decision on a service complaint can be brought. They therefore make provision about the time limit for applications to the Ombudsman where a complainant is notified that their appeal was not made on a valid ground. The time limit will now run from:
where an appeal has been made against the decision on the service complaint and determined, the day the complainant receives notification of the decision on that appeal;
where the appeal cannot be proceeded with because (and only because) it was not brought on a valid ground, the day the complainant receives the final decision that the appeal is invalid. The final invalidity decision will be either the decision of the Defence Council that the appeal is inadmissible (where the complainant does not seek a review of that decision), or the decision of the Service Complaints Ombudsman (where the complainant seeks a review of that decision and the decision is upheld);
where the complainant does not have grounds (of which the complainant is aware) on which they are entitled to bring an appeal against the decision, the day the complainant receives notification of the decision on the service complaint.
An application may still be accepted by the Ombudsman after the end of this period if the Ombudsman considers the circumstances set out in regulation 4(2) of the 2015 Regulations are met.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

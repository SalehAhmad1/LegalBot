Paragraph (6) of regulation 99 is amended so that work search and work availability requirements may not be imposed where a claimant has monthly earnings from employment that are equal to, or more than, 12 hours per week at the national minimum wage rate as set out in regulation 4 of the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (“the national living wage”) or, where the claimant is a member of a couple, their combined earnings from employment are equal to, or more than, 19 hours per week at the national living wage rate, in both cases converted to a monthly amount by multiplying by 52 and dividing by 12.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

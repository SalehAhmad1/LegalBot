displays and rehearsals that are scheduled to take place there on 13th August 2022 and 14th

Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the

The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST).

display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular

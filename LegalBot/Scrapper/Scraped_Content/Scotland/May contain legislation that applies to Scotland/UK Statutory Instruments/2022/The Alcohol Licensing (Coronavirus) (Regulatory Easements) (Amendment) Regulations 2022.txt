(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend section 172F(10)(d)(i) of the Licensing Act 2003 (c. 17) (“the 2003 Act”) and section 11(13) of the Business and Planning Act 2020 (c. 16) (“the 2020 Act”). Section 11 makes temporary modifications to the 2003 Act and specifies that these modifications expire on 30 September 2022.
The modifications provide automatic extensions of premises licences that only permit sales of alcohol for consumption on the premises (“on-sales”) to allow sales of alcohol for consumption off the premises (“off-sales”). They also apply temporary conditions to licences where there is a pre-existing permission for off-sales, to enable those premises to operate in the same ways as those granted the new permission, and provide for off-sales reviews to take place on grounds which are relevant to one or more of the licensing objectives. The licensing objectives are set out in section 4 of the 2003 Act.
Regulation 2 extends the application of the modifications from 30 September 2022 to 30 September 2023. The expiry date was changed to 30 September 2022 from 30 September 2021 by S.I. 2021/1049.
The amendments are made to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

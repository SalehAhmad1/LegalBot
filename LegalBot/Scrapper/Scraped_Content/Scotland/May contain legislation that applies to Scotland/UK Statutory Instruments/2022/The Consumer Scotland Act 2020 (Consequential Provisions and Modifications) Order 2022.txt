This Order makes provision in consequence of the Consumer Scotland Act 2020 (asp 11) which establishes Consumer Scotland and makes provision about its functions. Consumer Scotland is known as Luchd-Cleachdaidh Alba in Gaelic.
Article 2 provides that the Consumer Scotland is part of the Scottish Administration.
Article 3 provides that references in the Scotland Act 1998 and any other enactment to an office-holder in the Scottish Administration, however they are defined, are to be taken to include references to Consumer Scotland, unless the context otherwise requires. It also provides that the Crown Suits (Scotland) Act 1857 does not apply to Consumer Scotland with the effect that the Lord Advocate cannot be sued in place of Consumer Scotland.
Article 4 and the Schedule make modifications to primary and secondary legislation in consequence of the Consumer Scotland Act 2020 to transfer certain functions from the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureau (“Citizens Advice Scotland”) to Consumer Scotland, and to add Consumer Scotland as an additional body capable of performing certain functions.
Article 5 makes transitional and saving provision relating to the transfer of functions from Citizens Advice Scotland to Consumer Scotland.

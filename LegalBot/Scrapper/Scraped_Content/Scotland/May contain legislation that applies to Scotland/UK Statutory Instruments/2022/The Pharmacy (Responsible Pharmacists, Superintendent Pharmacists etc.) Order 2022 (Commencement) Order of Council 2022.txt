Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order of Council provides for the commencement of the Pharmacy (Responsible Pharmacists, Superintendent Pharmacists etc.) Order 2022 in so far as it is not yet in force.
That Order principally makes provision relating to the position and responsibilities of a superintendent pharmacist of a body corporate that is carrying on a retail pharmacy business, and in relation to the responsibilities of a responsible pharmacist who is in day to day charge of particular retail pharmacy premises.
The changes include amending the Medicines Act 1968 (c. 67) to provide that the power for Ministers to make regulations about the responsibilities of a responsible pharmacist becomes a power for the General Pharmaceutical Council to make rules as regards Great Britain and for the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland to make regulations as regards Northern Ireland. Amendments to the Pharmacy Order 2010 (S.I. 2010/231) and the Pharmacy (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 (S.I. 1976/1213 (N.I. 22)) also provide powers to these regulators to define the professional responsibilities of both superintendent pharmacists and responsible pharmacists in the professional standards of conduct and performance that they set. Minor and consequential amendments, and a transitional provision relating to Ministerial Regulations, are also commenced.

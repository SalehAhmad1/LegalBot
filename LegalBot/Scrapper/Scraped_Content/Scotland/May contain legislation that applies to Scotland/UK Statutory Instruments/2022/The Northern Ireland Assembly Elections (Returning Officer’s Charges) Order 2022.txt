(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 29(3) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2), as applied to Northern Ireland Assembly elections by the Northern Ireland Assembly (Elections) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/2599), enables the Secretary of State to specify in an Order the overall maximum recoverable amount that the returning officer may recover in respect of services rendered, or expenses incurred, for or in connection with an Assembly election.
This Order specifies those amounts in respect of each constituency in Northern Ireland. Five members of the Assembly are returned for each of the 18 Parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland. At an uncontested election in any constituency the amount is £1750.00. At a contested election, the amount for each constituency is set out in the table in the Schedule to the Order.
The amounts for contested elections are increased by an average of 14.5% compared to the amounts specified in the Northern Ireland Assembly Elections (Returning Officer’s Charges) Order 2016 (S.I. 2016/473) (the “2016 Order”). The amount for uncontested elections remains the same.
This Order also revokes the 2016 Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

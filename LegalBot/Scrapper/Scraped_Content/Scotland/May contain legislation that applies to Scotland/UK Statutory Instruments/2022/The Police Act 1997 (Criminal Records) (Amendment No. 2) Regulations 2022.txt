The purpose is considering whether a person who is a current or potential sponsor meets or continues to meet the requirements for approval to provide accommodation to a person who has applied for or been granted permission to enter or stay in the United Kingdom in accordance with Appendix Ukraine Scheme of the Immigration Rules. This includes assessing the suitability of any person who is over the age of 16, who resides with the current or potential sponsor, to have regular contact with the person who has applied for or has been granted permission to enter into or stay in the United Kingdom in accordance with Appendix Ukraine Scheme of the Immigration Rules (“the new prescribed purpose”).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Civil Service (Other Crown Servants) Pension Scheme Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/326) (“the 2016 Regulations”), primarily in consequence of provision made by the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7).
The amendments ensure that the existing pension schemes referred to as the First, Second, Third and Fourth Connected Schemes in the 2016 Regulations will be closed to future service accrual on and after 1st April 2022. Any members currently in pensionable service under the First, Second, Third and Fourth Connected pension schemes will, on that date, begin accruing benefits in the scheme established by the 2016 Regulations, with members of the Third Connected Scheme becoming extraordinary members under the 2016 Regulations.

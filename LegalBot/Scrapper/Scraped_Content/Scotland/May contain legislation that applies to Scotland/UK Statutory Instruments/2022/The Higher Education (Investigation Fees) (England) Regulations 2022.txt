Reg. 1 in force at 8.12.2022, see reg. 1(2)Fee payable to the Office for Students for investigation of a registered higher education provider
2.—(1) Subject to paragraph (6) and regulation 7, a fee is payable for the conducting by the OfS of an investigation of the activities of a registered higher education provider where, as a result of the investigation, the OfS—
(a)
finds that there is or has been a breach of any ongoing registration condition of the provider,
(b)
imposes a specific ongoing registration condition on the provider’s registration,
(c)
requires the provider’s governing body to provide information pursuant to an ongoing registration condition of the provider referred to in section 8(1)(b) of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, or
(d)
makes a recommendation that, in order to mitigate what the OfS considers to be the increased risk of a breach of an ongoing registration condition of the provider, the provider should take or refrain from taking any action specified by the OfS.
(2) The fee is payable by the governing body of the institution whose activities were the subject of the investigation.
(3) The amount of the fee is a sum which is equal to the total amount of all the costs reasonably incurred by the OfS in conducting the investigation.
(4) That sum is to be determined by the OfS.
(5) For the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (3), conducting an investigation includes—
(a)
making and communicating a decision to conduct the investigation,
(b)
settling and communicating the findings of the investigation, and
(c)
making any other decision, and engaging in any other activity, in connection with—
(i)
beginning the investigation;
(ii)
conducting the investigation;
(iii)
settling or communicating the findings of the investigation.
[F1(5A) But conducting an investigation does not include any activity in relation to which a fee is payable under the Higher Education (Assessment Fees) (England) Regulations 2023.]
(6) [F2The] fee under paragraph (1) is only payable if the OfS decides not to impose any sanction in relation to the provider as a result of the findings of the investigation (including where that is because it considers there to be no grounds to impose any sanction as a result of those findings).
(7) The references in paragraph (6) to imposing a sanction are references to—
(a)
imposing a monetary penalty under section 15 of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017,

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 71 of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (“the Act”) provides that the Office for Students (“the OfS”) may, in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State, charge fees for activities specified in those regulations undertaken by the OfS in the performance of its functions. These Regulations have been made for that purpose.
Regulation 2 provides for a fee to be payable for an investigation by the OfS of the activities of a registered higher education provider where the investigation has resulted in any of the outcomes specified in regulation 2(1)(a) to (d). The fee is payable by the governing body of the institution in question, but no fee is payable unless the OfS decides not to impose any sanctions on the provider under section 15, 16 or 18 of the Act. Section 73 of the Act provides for the recovery of the OfS’s costs when it imposes such a sanction, and allows for the recovery of investigation costs (and other costs) in those circumstances.
The fee payable is a sum, determined by the OfS, which is equal to the total amount of all the costs reasonably incurred by the OfS in conducting the investigation in question.
Regulation 3 requires the OfS to publish statements of its approach to determining the amount of fees payable under these Regulations.
Regulation 4 provides for waiver and reduction of fees by the OfS.
Regulation 5 provides for the OfS to give notice when a fee is payable. The notice must specify the period within which the fee is to be paid and other matters. It must allow a period for representations to be made about the fee.
Regulation 6 provides for interest to be charged on unpaid fees, and for unpaid amounts to be recoverable as a civil debt due to the OfS.
Regulation 7 provides that no fee is payable where the decision to investigate was made before the date on which these Regulations come into force.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations because no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

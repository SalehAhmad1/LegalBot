(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Policy Development Grants Scheme (“the Scheme”) set out in the Schedule to the Elections (Policy Development Grants Scheme) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/602).
The Scheme enables the making of policy development grants to certain political parties to assist with the development of policies for inclusion in their manifestos for: parliamentary elections, elections to the Scottish Parliament, the Senedd Cymru, and the Northern Ireland Assembly, local government elections, and local elections in Northern Ireland.
Under section 12 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (c. 41) the Electoral Commission must keep under review the terms of the Scheme and make recommendations to the Secretary of State for any variations to the Scheme which they consider appropriate. The changes made by this Order give effect to those recommendations and have effect in relation to the making of policy development grants on or after 1st April 2022.
This Order amends the Scheme to add Alba to the list of parties eligible for grants, and makes consequential amendments to the way in which money is allocated to eligible parties under the Scheme.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

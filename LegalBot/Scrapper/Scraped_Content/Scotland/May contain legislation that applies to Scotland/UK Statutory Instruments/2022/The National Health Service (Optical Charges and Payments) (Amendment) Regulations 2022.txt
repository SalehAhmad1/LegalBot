(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Optical Charges and Payments) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/461) (“the 2013 Regulations”) which make provision for payments to be made by means of vouchers to eligible persons, in respect of costs incurred in connection with sight tests and the supply, replacement and repair of optical appliances pursuant to Part 6 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41). They apply to England only.
The 2013 Regulations are amended to uprate voucher values. Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 20 of the 2013 Regulations to increase the redemption value of a voucher issued for replacement of a single contact lens or repair of a frame by an overall increase of approximately 2%.
Regulation 2(3) to (5) amends Schedules 1, 2 and 3 to the 2013 Regulations to increase the value of vouchers issued towards the cost of supply and replacement of glasses and contact lenses, increases the additional values of vouchers for prisms, tints, photochromic lenses and special categories of appliances and to increase the value of vouchers for the cost of the repair and replacement of optical appliances. The rate of increase is approximately 2%.
Regulation 3 makes transitional provision. In relation to vouchers accepted, presented or used before 1st April 2022, the old voucher values will apply.

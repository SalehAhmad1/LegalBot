16th May 2022
Coming into force
6th June 2022
An application has been made to the Secretary of State, under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008(1) (“the 2008 Act”) in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009(2) for an Order granting development consent.
The application was examined by a panel of two members (“the Panel”) (appointed by the Secretary of State) in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act, and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010(3).
The Panel, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn and the application together with the accompanying documents, in accordance with section 74(2) of the 2008 Act, has submitted a report and recommendation to the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn, and the report of the Panel, has decided to make an Order granting development consent for the development described in the application with modifications which in the opinion of the Secretary of State do not make any substantial changes to the proposals comprised in the application.
The Secretary of State is satisfied that the special category land (as defined in article 40(3) of this Order), when burdened with the Order rights (as defined in that article), will be no less advantageous than it was before to the persons in whom it is vested, other persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other rights, and the public, and that, accordingly, section 132(3) of the 2008 Act applies.

11.—(1) Any highway (other than a trunk road or special road) to be constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority in whose area the highway lies and, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the local highway authority, the highway including any culverts or other structures laid under it, must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(2) Where a highway (other than a trunk road or special road) is altered or diverted under this Order, the altered or diverted part of the highway [F1must be] completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority in whose area the highway lies and, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the local highway authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(3) Where a street which is not, and is not intended to be a highway is constructed, altered or diverted under this Order, the street (or part of the street as the case may be) must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street [F2authority] and, unless otherwise agreed in writing, be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from its completion and at the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the street authority.
(4) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a trunk road or special road) over a trunk road or special road, the highway surface (being those elements over the waterproofing membrane) must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the local highway authority, and the remainder of the bridge, including the waterproofing membrane, and structure below, must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker.
(5) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street or other structure under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street or structure to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(6) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (5), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street or structure and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street or structure of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street or structure;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street or structure to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street or structure; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street or structure before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street or structure to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street or structure and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.

(2) Protective works may be carried out—
(a)
at any time before or during the carrying out in the vicinity of the building of any part of the authorised development; or
(b)
after the completion of that part of the authorised development in the vicinity of the building at any time up to the end of the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which that part of the authorised development is first opened for use.
(3) For the purpose of determining how the functions under this article are to be exercised the undertaker may (subject to paragraph (5)) enter and survey any building falling within paragraph (1) and any land within its curtilage, and place on, leave on, and remove from the building any apparatus and equipment for use in connection with the survey.

Art. 37 in force at 6.6.2022, see art. 1Apparatus and rights of statutory undertakers in stopped up streets
38.—(1) Where a street is stopped up under article 15 (permanent stopping up of streets), any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, on, along or across the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus, subject to the provisions of this article, as if this Order had not been made.
(2) Where a street is stopped up under article 15 any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, on, over, along or across the street may, and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker must—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in such position as described in sub-paragraph (a).
(3) Subject to the following provisions of this article, the undertaker must pay to any statutory utility an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the utility in or in connection with—

apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.

(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.

(7) Paragraphs (3) to (6) do not apply where the authorised development constitutes major highway works, major bridge works or major transport works for the purposes of Part 3 of the 1991 Act, but instead—

(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 7 to the 2022 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and

(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restrictive covenant is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to compulsory acquisition under article 22 (authority to survey and investigate the land)), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry; further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 30(4) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—

1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and has not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 as applied by article 31 (application of the 1981 Act) of the M25 Junction 28 Development Consent Order 2022 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 32(3) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the M25 Junction 28 Development Consent Order 2022 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the proposed use of the right or the imposition of the covenant, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (6).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed the utility undertaker must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 53 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 53, and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) If the utility undertaker fails either reasonably to approve, or to provide reasons for its failure to approve along with an indication of what would be required to make acceptable, any proposed details relating to required removal works under sub-paragraph (2) within 28 days of receiving a notice of the required works from the undertaker, then such details are deemed to have been approved, provided that the undertaker has first taken all reasonable steps to contact the relevant representatives of the utility undertaker in order to elicit such a response.
(8) Any deemed approval under sub-paragraph (7) does not extend to the actual undertaking of the removal works, which remains the sole responsibility of the utility undertaker or its contractors.

(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

Retained apparatus
9.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.

Expenses and costs
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker all expenses reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2).
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 53 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless a utility undertaker fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and professional like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made, without the consent of the undertaker who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out or maintenance of any part of the authorised development (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of Cadent or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Cadent and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as Cadent reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent unless otherwise agreed by Cadent, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure or secure the consent to and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised development or maintenance thereof.
(3) The undertaker and Cadent agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus, including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by Cadent and other enactments relied upon by Cadent as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by Cadent under paragraph 62 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) As a condition of an agreement under sub-paragraph (1) that involves de-commissioned apparatus being left in situ the undertaker must accept a surrender of any existing easement or other interest of Cadent in such decommissioned apparatus and release Cadent from all liabilities in respect of such de-commissioned apparatus from the date of such surrender.
(6) Where an undertaker acquires land which is subject to any Cadent right or interest (including, without limitation, easements and agreements relating to rights or other interests) and the provisions of paragraph 60 do not apply, the undertaker must, unless Cadent agrees otherwise—
(a)
retain any notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land; and
(b)
(where no such notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register) include (with its application to register title to the undertaker’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry) a notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land.

Removal of apparatus
60.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, including pursuant to any agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 59, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of Cadent to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and the facilities and rights referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of Cadent and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Cadent advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Cadent reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to Cadent to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 61(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation must not extend to the requirement for Cadent to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.

Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
61.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 68 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any specified works until Cadent has given written approval of the plan so submitted (and the ground monitoring scheme if required).
(4) Any approval of Cadent given under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (5); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and Cadent must meaningfully engage with the undertaker within 28 days of the date of submission of the plan under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plan as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Specified works must only be executed in accordance with—
(a)
the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) (and ground monitoring scheme if required), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent; and
(b)
all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and Cadent will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If Cadent, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 54 to 56 and 59 to 61 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 60(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan (and ground monitoring scheme if required), instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan (and ground monitoring scheme if required).
(10) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development (including such an event attributable to its maintenance)—
(a)
the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme; and
(b)
Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 63.
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(12) In this paragraph, “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to, or to prevent the occurrence of, circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works believes on reasonable grounds to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.

(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by Cadent in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including professional fees) incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 60(3) if it elects to do so; or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers under this Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;

(g)
any watching brief pursuant to sub-paragraph 62(6).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 68 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances (or it would be unlawful due to a statutory or regulatory change) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;

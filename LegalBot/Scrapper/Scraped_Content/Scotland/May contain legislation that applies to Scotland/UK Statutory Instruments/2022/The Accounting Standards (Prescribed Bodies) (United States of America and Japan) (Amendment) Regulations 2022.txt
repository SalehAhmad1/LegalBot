(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Accounting Standards (Prescribed Bodies) (United States of America and Japan) Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”).
Regulation 3 amends regulation 1 of the 2015 Regulations in order to extend those Regulations for a year expiring on 30th September 2023.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 8 of the 2015 Regulations by inserting a new date by which the Secretary of State must complete the review of the 2015 Regulations and compile a report setting out the conclusion of the review. The Secretary of State must then publish the report in accordance with regulation 9 of 2015 Regulations.
The Regulations extend to the whole of the United Kingdom, reflecting the extent of the Companies Act 2006.
A full impact assessment of the effect that the Regulations will have on the costs of business is annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum of the 2015 Regulations. This is available alongside the 2015 Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

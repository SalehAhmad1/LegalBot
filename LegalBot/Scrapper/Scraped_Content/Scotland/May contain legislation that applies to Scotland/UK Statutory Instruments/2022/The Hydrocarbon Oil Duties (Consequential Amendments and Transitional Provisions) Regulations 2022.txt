These Regulations make provision relating to restriction on the use of rebated diesel and biofuels to specified categories of machines introduced by the Finance Act 2021 (c. 26) and the Finance Act 2022 (c. 3).
Part 1 provides for citation, commencement and interpretation.
Part 2 makes amendments to a number of statutory instruments consequential on the new restrictions on the use of rebated diesel and biofuels.
Regulation 2 amends the Hydrocarbon Oil Regulations 1973 (S.I. 1973/1311) to extend existing powers relating to the inspection, testing and sampling of oil, bioblend or bioethanol blend in or forming part of the fuel supply of any vehicle to any vehicle, vessel, machine or appliance.
Regulation 3 amends the Other Fuel Substitutes (Rates of Excise Duty etc) Order 1995 (S.I. 1995/2716) to extend provisions relating to determination of the appropriate rate of duty for fuel substitutes, additive and extenders to heating systems and to clarify that the rate of duty for a fuel substitute to be used in a diesel engine, or an engine, other than a piston engine, of an aircraft, is that specified by section 6 of the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979 (c. 5) (“HODA”) for heavy oil minus the rate of rebate allowable under section 11.
Regulation 4 amends the Hydrocarbon Oil (Designated Markers) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/1251) to provide for the designation of markers for the purposes of identifying fuel that is not to be used other than for an excepted machine (as defined by section 27 of HODA).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the power contained in Article 25(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products (“the CMO Regulation”), as read with Article 3(5)(c)(i)(aa) and (ii)(bb) of that Regulation. They apply only in England and Scotland.
These Regulations amend Articles 4 and 9 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/39. They amend provisions relating to documentary evidence required to support applications for aid under the scheme established by Articles 22 to 25 of the CMO Regulation (“the school milk scheme”). As a result of these amendments, applicants for such aid are now only required to hold such documentary evidence available for the relevant authority, instead of having to submit it with the application for aid.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

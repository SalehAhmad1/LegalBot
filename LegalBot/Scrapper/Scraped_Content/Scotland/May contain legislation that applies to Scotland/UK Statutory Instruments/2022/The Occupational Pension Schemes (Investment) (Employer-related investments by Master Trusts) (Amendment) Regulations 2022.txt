18th July 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations narrow the scope of investments that come within the definition of “employer-related investments” for large Master Trust schemes with 500 or more participating employers.
Regulation 2 amends the Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/3378) so that the restrictions on employer-related investments by large Master Trusts only apply to investments relating to a scheme funder, a scheme strategist and persons connected or associated with a scheme funder or a scheme strategist.
Regulation 3 amends the Occupational Pension Schemes (Requirement to obtain Audited Accounts and a Statement from the Auditor) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/1975), so that the accounting requirements for large Master Trust schemes reflect the updated provisions on employer-related investments that apply in respect of those schemes.
Regulation 4 amends the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/2734), so that the information that must be disclosed on request to members of large Master Trust schemes reflects the updated provisions on employer-related investments that apply in respect of those schemes.
Regulation 5 makes consequential amendments to the Application of Pension Legislation to the National Employment Savings Trust Corporation Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/8) to remove a provision which is no longer needed as a result of the changes made by regulation 2 of these Regulations.
A full regulatory impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from legislation.gov.uk. A hard copy of the impact assessment may be obtained from the Department for Work and Pensions, Caxton House, Tothill Street, London SW1H 9NA.

Reg. 5 in force at 1.11.2022, see reg. 1(2)Calculation of pass-through amount
6.—(1) The amount which an intermediary must pass on to an end user under the pass-through requirement is an amount in pounds sterling or in pounds sterling per kWh of energy which comprises all of the scheme benefit, or if less than the amount of scheme benefit, a just and reasonable amount calculated in accordance with this regulation (“pass-through amount”).
(2) If the pass-through amount is less than the amount of scheme benefit, the intermediary must provide evidence to the end user showing what factors it took into account in determining that the pass-through amount was just and reasonable.
(3) In determining what is a just and reasonable pass-through amount, the intermediary may take account of—
(a)
the amount the intermediary paid for the energy in respect of which the scheme benefit was provided (“the input energy”);
(b)
other costs incurred by the intermediary in supplying heating or hot water to its end users in the period for which the scheme benefit was provided (“relevant period”); and
(c)
any loss incurred where, as a result of a relevant change in the price of energy(1), the total amount charged to end users for the supply of heating and hot water in the relevant period is less than the amount paid for the total quantity of input energy.
(4) Subject to paragraph (3), a pass-through amount is just and reasonable where—
(a)
at the time the intermediary was provided with the scheme benefit, the intermediary was charging the end user either—
(i)
based on the proportion of the total quantity of input energy which the end user’s usage represented; or
(ii)
based on the proportion of the total amount paid by the intermediary for energy in a period which the amount paid by the end user for the supply of heating and hot water in that period represented; and
(b)
the intermediary calculates the pass-through amount for the end user on this basis.
(5) If paragraph (4) does not apply, the intermediary in determining what is a just and reasonable pass-through amount—
(a)
must apply the best available information to allocate the scheme benefit amongst end users; and
(b)
may take into account the basis on which the intermediary was allocating charges amongst end users at the time the intermediary was provided with the scheme benefit.
(6) The pass-through amount for a person who is an end user for part of a relevant period must be calculated only for that part of the relevant period for which they were an end user.
(7) In calculating a pass-through amount—
(a)
an intermediary is not required to pass on to its end users an aggregate amount that exceeds the amount of scheme benefit provided to the intermediary;
(b)
an intermediary which is also an end user must not retain more of the scheme benefit for itself—
(i)
than is proportionate to its own end user’s usage; or
(ii)
than the proportion of the amount the intermediary paid for the total quantity of input energy that the intermediary itself bears (where it is not practicable to assess the quantity of its own end user’s usage);
(c)
an intermediary may include the quantity of heating or hot water supplied to common areas in a building as part of its own end user’s usage if the intermediary was not charging end users for this as part of the arrangements in place at the time the intermediary was provided with the scheme benefit.
(8) In this regulation, “end user’s usage” means the total quantity of input energy in kWh used in a relevant period to supply heating and hot water to an end user in that period.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for the pass-through requirement in relation to the Energy Bill Relief Scheme (EBRS) in England and Wales and Scotland. The pass-through requirement is imposed on a person who supplies and charges for the supply of heating or hot water to an end user through a heat network using energy(1) in respect of which the person has been provided a scheme benefit (“intermediary”). It requires the intermediary to pass on the benefits of the EBRS scheme to its end users.
Regulation 3 makes provision about energy price support provided by the Energy Bill Relief Scheme. This is defined as a “scheme benefit”.
Regulation 4 requires an intermediary who has been provided with a scheme benefit to notify each of its end users in writing that it has been provided with the benefit.
Regulation 5 imposes a requirement on intermediaries to secure that a scheme benefit provided to an intermediary is passed on to its end users as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been provided with the scheme benefit. If not all of the scheme benefit is being passed on to the end users, intermediaries are required to pass on a just and reasonable amount of the benefit to each of its end users.
Regulation 6 defines “pass-through amount” and provides for methods of calculating the amount and determining what is a just and reasonable pass-through amount.
Regulation 7 requires intermediaries to provide billing information to end users.
Regulation 8 provides for the end user to recover unpaid pass-through amounts from the intermediary as a civil debt.
Regulation 9 establishes a consumer redress scheme for end users of intermediaries.
Regulation 10 provides for enforcement of the requirement to join the redress scheme.
An impact assessment of the effect the EBRS scheme, including the related pass-through requirements, will have on the costs of business and the voluntary sector is available from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0ET.

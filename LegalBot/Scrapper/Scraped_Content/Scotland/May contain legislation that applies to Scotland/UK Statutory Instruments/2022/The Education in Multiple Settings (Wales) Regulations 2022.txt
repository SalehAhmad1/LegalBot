Minister for Education and Welsh Language, one of the Welsh Ministers
15 June 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021 (“the 2021 Act”) establishes a new framework for a curriculum and makes provision about assessment for pupils and children in Wales. This is the Curriculum for Wales (“CfW”).
Many children and pupils are educated in more than 1 setting. These Regulations make provision for the persons set out in these Regulations to prepare and review a plan as to the teaching and learning to be provided for the child or pupil in the CfW and to set out what assessment arrangements will apply to the child or pupil.
Regulation 1 of these Regulations provides for the commencement of these Regulations by year group. This will mirror the planned roll out of the CfW which will also be phased in over a period of time by year group.
The CfW and these Regulations will become mandatory as follows—
(a)
on 1 September 2022 for pupils in a reception year at a maintained school,
(b)
on 1 September 2022 for children and pupils in years 1 to 6,
(c)

(d)

(e)

These Regulations will apply to the following—
(a)
maintained schools,
(b)
pupil referral units, and
(c)
the provision of teaching and learning for a child otherwise than at a pupil referral unit by virtue of arrangements made under section 19A of the Education Act 1996.
These Regulations require the appropriate local authority to make and review a plan for those children and pupils who are educated in more than 1 setting. The plan must set out the teaching and learning to be provided for the child or pupil at each setting, and the assessment arrangements that will apply to the child or pupil at each setting.
In respect of those settings within regulations 3 to 5 of these Regulations the plan must also set out the arrangements for reporting pursuant to the Provision of Information by Head Teachers to Parents and Adult Pupils (Wales) Regulations 2022 (“the 2022 Regulations”). The reporting requirements in the 2022 Regulations apply only to maintained schools and pupil referral units. It is intended that the arrangements will specify which setting will take the lead in providing the report pursuant to the 2022 Regulations. This provision is not needed for those settings within regulations 6 to 8 as independent schools are not subject to the 2022 Regulations.
Regulation 3 makes provision in respect of pupils registered at more than 1 maintained school.
Regulation 4 makes provision in respect of pupils registered at more than 1 pupil referral unit.
Regulation 5 makes provision in respect of pupils registered in at least 1 maintained school and in at least 1 pupil referral unit.
Regulation 6 makes provision in respect of pupils registered in at least 1 maintained school and in at least 1 independent school. A pupil may be receiving education at an independent school pursuant to section 19A of the Education Act 1996. Such a pupil would be provided with a curriculum that met the requirements of section 53 of the 2021 Act.
Regulation 7 makes provision in respect of pupils registered in at least 1 pupil referral unit and in at least 1 independent school.
Regulation 8 makes provision in respect of pupils registered at more than 1 independent school.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

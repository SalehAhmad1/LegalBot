(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Health and Care Act 2022 (c. 31) (“the 2022 Act”) amended the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41) (“the 2006 Act”) to provide for, amongst other things, the establishment of integrated care boards and the abolition of clinical commissioning groups.
New section 14Z25(4) of the 2006 Act requires the statutory body known as NHS England (formerly the National Health Service Commissioning Board) to ensure that, on and after the appointed day, the areas of integrated care boards together cover the whole of England. New section 14Z27(1) of the 2006 Act abolishes any clinical commissioning group existing immediately before the appointed day at the beginning of that day. These Regulations appoint 1st July 2022 for these purposes.

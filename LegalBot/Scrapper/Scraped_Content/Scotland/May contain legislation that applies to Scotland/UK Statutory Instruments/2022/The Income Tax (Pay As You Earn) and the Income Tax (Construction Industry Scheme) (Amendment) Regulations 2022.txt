4th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Regulations amend the Income Tax (Pay As You Earn) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/2682) (“the PAYE Regulations”). The Regulations also amend the Income Tax (Construction Industry Scheme) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/2045) (“the CIS Regulations”).
Regulation 1 provides for citation, commencement and effect. Regulation 3 comes into force on 6th May 2022, and the remaining provisions come into force on 6th April 2022. Regulation 4 has effect in relation to elections made under regulation 98 of the PAYE Regulations on or after 6th April 2022. Regulation 6 has effect in relation to elections made under regulation 3 of the CIS Regulations on or after 6th April 2022.
Regulation 3 inserts new regulation 65A into the PAYE Regulations. New regulation 65A deals with the way in which information relating to deductions from net taxable earnings for expenses incurred by an employee (referred to as “deductible expenses”), which are allowed under Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (c. 1), should be notified to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”).
Paragraphs (1) and (2) of new regulation 65A set out the circumstances where the notification provisions apply. Paragraph (3) requires, in such circumstances, that information is to be provided in accordance with new regulation 65A. Paragraph (4) sets out the specified information that should be provided to HMRC. Paragraphs (5) and (6) provide for the Commissioners for HMRC to specify (in a direction) the form and manner in which the information is to be provided, including by the use of electronic communications. Paragraph (7) specifies the time limit for providing the information.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 98 of the PAYE Regulations, which contains the rules permitting an employer to make an election so that they are treated as different employers in relation to different groups of employees (referred to as “multiple PAYE schemes”). The amendments to regulation 98 provide for mid-year elections, allow employees to be allocated to more than one group, and make consequential changes to the rules about the information that is required to be included in an election notice, as well as the time periods within which an election can be made or revoked.
Regulation 6 amends regulation 3 of the CIS Regulations, in order to make equivalent changes (to those in regulation 4) to the rules relating to elections made by a contractor to be treated as different contractors in relation to different groups of sub-contractors.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared in relation to these changes as they contain no substantive changes to tax policy.

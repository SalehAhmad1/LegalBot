(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”) and come into force on 2nd November 2022.
Regulation 3 amends rule 78 to the Schedule to the 2013 Regulations to update the provision in relation to taxation in Scotland by substituting the “Act of Sederunt (Taxation of Judicial Expenses Rules) 2019” for the “Act of Sederunt (Fees of Solicitors in the Sheriff Court) (Amendment and Further Provisions) 1993”.
Regulation 4 provides for transitional arrangements in relation to the above amendment.
The estimated familiarisation costs to business, and the ongoing costs and benefits to business from these reforms are expected to be well below the threshold of £5 million a year required for the production of a full impact assessment.

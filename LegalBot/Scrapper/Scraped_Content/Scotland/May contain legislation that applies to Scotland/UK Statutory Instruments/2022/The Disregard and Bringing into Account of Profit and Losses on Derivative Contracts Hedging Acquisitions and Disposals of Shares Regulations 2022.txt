(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Loan Relationships and Derivative Contracts (Disregard and Bringing into Account of Profits and Losses) Regulations 2004 (“the Disregard Regulations”) and the Exchange Gains and Losses (Bringing into Account Gains or Losses) Regulations 2002 (“the EGLBAGL Regulations”) to allow certain debits and credits from currency derivative contracts to be left out of account and, in certain circumstances, to be brought back into account.
Regulation 1 provides for citation, commencement and effect.
Regulation 2 amends the Disregard Regulations to extend the scope of the Regulations to derivative contracts which act as a hedge of a foreign exchange risk in relation to an anticipated future acquisition or disposal of certain shareholdings.
Regulation 2(2) amends the definition of a hedging relationship to include hedges of forecast transactions and firm commitments.
Regulation 2(3) amends regulation 4 of the Disregard Regulations to disapply this regulation to the extent that regulation 5ZA applies.
Regulation 2(4) inserts new regulation 5ZA which provides for an amount to be excluded from amounts brought into account in determining a company’s profits and losses where it relates to a derivative contract which hedges a foreign exchange risk in relation to an anticipated future acquisition or disposal of a relevant shareholding. Paragraph (1) sets out the derivatives to which the provision applies. Paragraphs (2) and (3) set out the nature of the hedging relationship. Paragraph (4) provides for which amounts are to be excluded and the shareholdings to which the regulation applies. Paragraphs (5) defines what type of dividend can be the subject of a hedging relationship. Paragraph (6) provides for an apportionment where only part of a derivative is used as a hedge, Paragraph (7) sets out cases where this regulation does not apply. Paragraph (8) and (9) are for interpretation and definitions.
Regulation 2(5) and (6) amend regulations 7 and 7A of the Disregard Regulations to disapply those regulations to the extent that regulation 5ZA applies.
Regulation 3 amends the EGLBAGL Regulations to provide for amounts that were not brought into account by virtue of the amendment to the Disregard Regulations to be brought into account on the eventual disposal of the shares to which the hedge related. Paragraph (2) amends regulation 3 of the EGLBAGL Regulations to provide for cases where amounts disregarded under regulation 5ZA of the Disregard Regulations are to be brought into account. Paragraph (3) amends regulation 5 of the EGLBAGL Regulations to make provision for the calculation of the amount to be brought into account.

These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(b) and (d)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. They are also made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7 to that Act, where it is considered necessary to restate or clarify provisions of retained EU law.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of environmental protection and, in particular, amend legislation relating to access to genetic resources and fair and equitable sharing of benefits. Part 2 amends subordinate legislation and Part 3 amends retained direct EU legislation.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Order)
The First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal (Chambers) Order 2010 (S.I. 2010/2655) (“the 2010 Order”) organises the First-tier and Upper Tribunal into chambers and makes provision for the allocation of those tribunals’ functions between the chambers.
This Order amends the 2010 Order to provide that the function of deciding appeals under the Childcare (Early Years Provision Free of Charge) (Extended Entitlement) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/1257) is allocated to the Social Entitlement Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal rather than to the Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal.
No impact assessment has been carried out for these amendments as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

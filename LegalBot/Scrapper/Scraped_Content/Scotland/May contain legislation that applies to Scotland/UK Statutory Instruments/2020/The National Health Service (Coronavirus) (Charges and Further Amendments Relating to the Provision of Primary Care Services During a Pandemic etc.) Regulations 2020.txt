Minister of State,
Department of Health and Social Care
20th August 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) Regulations 2015, which include the charges that are payable for the supply of NHS drugs and appliances in England. Those Regulations are amended so that the Secretary of State may, in a pandemic situation, waive or modify requirements in respect of forms and providing evidence. There is, for example, a requirement on a person paying a charge to sign a declaration that they have done so, and a requirement on a person claiming certain exemptions from paying a charge to complete a declaration of entitlement to the exemption (regulation 2(2)).
These Regulations also amend the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013, which govern the arrangements in England under Part 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”) for the provision of pharmaceutical services and local pharmaceutical services. The Health and Wellbeing Board of each local authority is required to produce a plan known as a pharmaceutical needs assessment. The timetable for the next assessment has been put back so that it has to be completed by 1st April 2022 rather than 1st April 2021, and 1st April 2022 is also the date for the first assessment of a new unitary authority (regulation 4(2)). Changes have also been made to extend the time periods within which successful applicants in respect of new premises need to open, and to revive recently ended time periods to give those potential NHS chemists an additional six months after the date on which these Regulations come into force within which to open (regulation 4(3)).
The General Ophthalmic Services Contracts Regulations 2008, the Primary Ophthalmic Services Regulations 2008 and the National Health Service (Optical Charges and Payments) Regulations 2013 (“the Ophthalmic Services Regulations”) together set the framework for the provision of primary ophthalmic services in England, and in particular for the provision of and payments for free sight tests and the provision of vouchers to pay for or contribute towards the cost of optical appliances. These Regulations amend the Ophthalmic Services Regulations to allow the Secretary of State, in a pandemic situation, to waive or modify requirements in respect of forms and providing evidence that are part of establishing entitlement to, and providing reimbursement for, these services. There is, for example, a requirement upon an eligible person wishing to have their sight tested to sign a declaration that they are an eligible person, and a requirement for a similar declaration to be signed by an eligible person on a voucher for an optical appliance (regulations 3, 5 and 6).
The National Health Service (Dental Charges) Regulations 2005 provide for the charges payable in England in respect of the provision of primary dental services by dental practices. These Regulations amend those Regulations to allow the Secretary of State, in a pandemic situation, to waive or modify requirements in respect of forms and providing evidence that support charging for these services. There is, for example, a requirement upon a person exempt from payment of dental charges to make a written declaration to that effect, and a requirement upon a person who is not exempt to provide a written acknowledgement to that effect (regulation 7).
These Regulations also amend the National Health Service (Personal Dental Services Agreements) Regulations 2005 and the National Health Service (General Dental Services Contracts) Regulations 2005, which make provision in respect of the services provided in England under a personal dental services agreement and a general dental services contract made pursuant to Part 5 of the 2006 Act. These Regulations amend those Regulations to allow the Secretary of State, in a pandemic situation, to waive or modify requirements in respect of the treatment plans and summaries provided by service providers (regulations 8 and 9).

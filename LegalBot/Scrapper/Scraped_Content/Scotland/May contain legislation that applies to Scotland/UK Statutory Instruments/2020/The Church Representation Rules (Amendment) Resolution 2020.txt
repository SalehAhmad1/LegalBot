Registrar of the General SynodEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Resolution)
This Resolution amends the Church Representation Rules (“the CRRs”) as set out in Schedule 3 to the Synodical Government Measure 1969. It also makes consequential amendments to the Churchwardens Measure 2001.
The amendments in Part 2 introduce a revised system of appeals in relation to elections held under the CRRs (for example, elections to a deanery or diocesan synod). They are intended to provide consistency with the General Synod’s new procedural rules for elections to the House of Laity and to the Upper and Lower Houses of the Convocations.
Paragraph 2 brings enrolment appeals within the new procedure for appeals.
Paragraph 3 provides for appeals against a determination that a nomination of a candidate is or is not valid, appeals against the allowance or disallowance of a vote, and appeals against the result of an election.
Paragraph 4 adjusts the power to make rules for appeals relating to elections to the House of Laity, to enable those rules to make provision consistent with those for the other elections concerned.
Paragraph 5 introduces two separate appeals procedures, a summary appeal and a full appeal. The appropriate procedure in any given case depends on the type of appeal.
Paragraph 6 sets out the procedure on summary appeals, including provision for the matter to be determined by a single judge who will, in most cases, be the Dean of the Arches and Auditor.
Paragraph 7 sets out the procedure on full appeals, including provision for the matter to be determined by a panel appointed specially for the purpose.
Paragraph 8 makes general provision, including for the payment by the parties to an appeal of the expenses of the judge or panel determining the appeal.
Paragraph 9 makes provision for rights of appeal to be notified in advance.
Paragraph 10 makes consequential amendments. In particular, it amends section 5A of the Churchwardens Measure 2001 to ensure that it is consistent with the other appeals provisions.
The amendments in Part 3 make minor amendments elsewhere in the CRRs.
Paragraph 11 removes the anomaly of the requirement for the registers of clerical or lay electors to include the names of co-opted members, even though they are not entitled to vote.
Paragraphs 12, 13 and 15 correct drafting errors.
Paragraph 14 amends the definition of “community roll”, in relation to a cathedral, so as to ensure that only those persons whom the dean of the cathedral declares to be habitual worshippers are entitled to be represented on deanery synod.

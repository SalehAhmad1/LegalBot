Department for TransportEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in sections 8(1) and 23(1) of, and Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular the deficiencies referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (e) and (g) of section 8(2)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to and revocations of legislation in the field of air traffic management. Part 2 covers retained direct EU legislation, Part 3 covers an EU decision, and Part 4 amends subordinate UK legislation.
Of note in these Regulations are the following changes.
Regulation 6 confirms the Civil Aviation Authority as the competent authority for the purposes of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/373 responsible for certification, oversight and enforcement in respect of air traffic management and air navigation service providers.
Regulation 53 revokes Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/317 which sets out a performance and charging scheme in the single European sky for the period from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2024.
Regulation 54 revokes Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/903 which sets the Union-wide performance targets for the air traffic management network from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2024.
Regulation 55 amends the Air Traffic Management (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/459).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on the UK legislation website, www.legislation.gov.uk.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in airspace in the vicinity of Old Warden 
Aerodrome, Buckinghamshire, during flying displays for the general public that are scheduled to 
take place there on 27th September and 18th October 2020. A large number of aircraft will be 
involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the Civil Aviation 
Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in the vicinity of 
the display for reasons of public safety. 
In relation to regulation 3, the term ‘aircraft’ includes aircraft as classified by Part 1 of Schedule 4 
to the Air Navigation Order 2016. It also includes, by virtue of article 23 of that Order, any small 
balloon, any kite weighing not more than two kilograms, any small unmanned aircraft and any 
parachute including a parascending parachute. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(2) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC), which for the 
purpose of these Regulations is one hour behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(3), the Old Warden Aerodrome flying 
display director may be contacted on telephone number 01767 627918 or 07875028876.

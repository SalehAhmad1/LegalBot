3rd December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Energy Performance of Buildings (England and Wales) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/3118) (“the principal regulations”), which implemented Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings (recast) (OJ No L 153, 18.6.2010, p. 13). That Directive was amended by Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 (OJ No L 156, 19.06.2018, p. 75). These Regulations partially implement the first subparagraph of Article 15(1) (which is inserted into Directive 2010/31/EU by Article 1(7) of Directive (EU) 2018/844).
Regulation 3 inserts a new provision into regulation 19 of the principal regulations which imposes a new requirement for the inspection of air-conditioning systems. Inspection reports must consider the optimisation of performance capabilities of each system.
Regulation 4 makes a consequential amendment to regulation 19A to ensure compliance with the new regulation 19(2A).

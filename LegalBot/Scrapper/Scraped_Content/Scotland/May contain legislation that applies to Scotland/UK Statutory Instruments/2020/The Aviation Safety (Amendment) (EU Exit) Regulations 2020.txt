12th October 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16), in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of aviation safety. None of the changes being made alter the technical requirements and standards established by the legislation.
Part 2 amends domestic subordinate legislation. It makes a range of amendments to the Aviation Safety (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/645), and a small number of amendments to the Aviation Safety (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1098).
Part 3 amends a principal EU Regulation. It amends Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005 on the establishment of a Community list of air carriers subject to an operating ban within the Community and on informing air transport passengers of the identity of the operating carrier.
Part 4 amends various EU implementing Regulations adopted by the European Commission, to take account of amendments to these made by new Commission Regulations. The Commission Regulations it amends are: Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 (aircrew); Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 (air operations); Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 (initial airworthiness); Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 (continuing airworthiness); Regulation (EU) No 2018/395 (operation of balloons); and Regulation (EU) No 2018/1976 (sailplanes).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

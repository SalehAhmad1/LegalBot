25th June 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (Election of Mayor with Police and Crime Commissioner Functions) Order 2016 (S.I. 2016/448) provides for there to be a mayor of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (“the GMCA”), and for the mayor to exercise the functions of a police and crime commissioner for the area of the GMCA (“the area”).
The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (Transfer of Police and Crime Commissioner Functions to the Mayor) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/470) makes detailed provision about the transfer of police and crime commissioner functions to the mayor of the GMCA. It provides for the mayor to appoint a deputy mayor for policing and crime for the area, and for a police and crime panel to scrutinise the exercise of police and crime functions by the mayor.
The Greater Manchester Combined Authority (Fire and Rescue Functions) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/469, “the 2017 Order”) provides for the conferral of fire and rescue functions on the GMCA. It provides for the GMCA to be the fire and rescue authority for the area for the purposes of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, for certain fire and rescue functions to be exercisable only by the mayor, and for the mayor to arrange for those fire and rescue functions to be exercised by a committee of the GMCA.
This instrument amends the 2017 Order. It authorises the mayor of the GMCA to arrange for those fire and rescue functions to be exercised by the deputy mayor for policing and crime. It provides for the police and crime panel to have oversight functions in relation to the exercise of all those fire and rescue functions, whether exercised by the Mayor or by the deputy mayor for policing and crime, and for the police and crime panel to be known as “the Police, Fire and Crime Panel” to reflect its extended remit.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument will have no impact on the costs of business and the voluntary sector.

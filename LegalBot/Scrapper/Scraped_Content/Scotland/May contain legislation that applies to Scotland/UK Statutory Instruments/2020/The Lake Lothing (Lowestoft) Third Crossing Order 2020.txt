8.—(1) Any highway to be constructed altered or diverted under this Order including any culverts or other structures laid under it must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(2) Where a street which is not and is not intended to be a public highway is constructed, altered or diverted under this Order, the street (or part of the street as the case may be) must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority, unless otherwise agreed in writing, be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from its completion and at the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the street authority.
(3) The structure and highway surface of the new bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from the date of the completion of the new bridge.
(4) Where land not previously part of the public highway comes to form part of the public highway by virtue of the construction, diversion or alteration of the streets set out in Schedule 4 (permanent stopping up of highways and private means of access and provision of new highways and private means of access), unless otherwise agreed with the street authority, the land is deemed to have been dedicated as public highway on the expiry of a period of 12 months from completion of the works to the street that has been constructed, altered or diverted.
(5) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by the undertaker to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(6) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (5), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.
(7) The date of completion of any works to a highway pursuant to this article is to be agreed by the undertaker and the local highway authority.
(8) The date of completion of any works to a street which is not and is not intended to be a highway pursuant to this article is to be agreed by the undertaker and the street authority.

(2) Where a street is stopped up under article 10 any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, on, over, along or across the street may, and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker must—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in such position as described in sub-paragraph (a).
(3) Subject to the following provisions of this article, the undertaker must pay to any statutory utility an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the utility in or in connection with—

2.  But see article 27(4) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the Lake Lothing (Lowestoft) Third Crossing Order 2020 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from the application of this Schedule.
3.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.

Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)

(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
15.  Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the statutory undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably practicable use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(3) The obligation imposed on the statutory undertaker under sub-paragraph (2)(a) does not extend to the exercise by the statutory undertaker of any power to acquire any land or rights in land by compulsory purchase order.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the statutory undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 62 (arbitration).

(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the new bridge and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the undertaker; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to any apparatus constructed in, under, over or above the new bridge area for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the statutory undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that statutory undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 62 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the statutory undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.

(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply until Cadent has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of Cadent required under sub-paragraph (2)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (5) or (7); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraph (1) or (2) applies, Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (4), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or (7) by Cadent for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Cadent is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent's satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required and Cadent must give 56 days' notice of such works from the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(8) If Cadent in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or (7) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 78 to 80 and 83 to 85 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 84(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days unless otherwise agreed by Cadent and the undertaker before commencing the execution of the authorised works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act, but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must—
(a)
comply with sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
comply with sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(11) At all times when carrying out any part of the authorised development the undertaker must comply with Cadent's policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “Specification for safe working in the vicinity of National Grid, High pressure Gas pipelines and associated installation requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22” and HSE's “HS(~G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
(12) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event, identified in the light of monitoring required in sub-paragraph (1) or which otherwise becomes apparent, attributable to the authorised development the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 87.

Expenses
87.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Cadent on reasonable demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by Cadent in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any part of the authorised development as is referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by Cadent in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for alternative apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 84(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 92 to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works to apparatus or alternative apparatus under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth due either to unavailability of a like for like replacement or as a result of changes in policy or regulations rendering the original apparatus inappropriate, unacceptable or obsolete, in which case full costs must be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of the existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus,
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount that represents that benefit.

Indemnity
88.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works to apparatus or alternative apparatus authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by the undertaker) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or the undertaker becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any omission, negligence or default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision must not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workmanlike manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any part of the authorised development or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by Cadent as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 (benefit of order granting development consent) of the 2008 Act or article 49 (transfer of benefit of order, etc.) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this paragraph (b) are subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph.
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering its representations.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order authorises Suffolk County Council to construct, operate and maintain the Lake Lothing Third Crossing. This is a lifting bridge which would open to allow tall vessels to pass through Lake Lothing. It would connect the areas to the north and south of Lake Lothing and would be located between the existing bascule bridge carrying the A47 and the existing Mutford Lock bridge.
The Order would permit Suffolk County Council to acquire, compulsorily or by agreement, land and rights over land and to use land temporarily for purposes in connection with the authorised development.
The Order also includes provisions in relation to the operation of the new lifting bridge and in relation to tidal works.
A copy of all documents referred to in this Order and certified in accordance with article 60 of this Order (certification of documents) may be inspected free of charge during working hours at the offices of Suffolk County Council, Endeavour House, 8 Russell Road, Ipswich, Suffolk IP1 2BX and at Riverside, 4 Canning Road, Lowestoft, Suffolk NR33 0EQ.

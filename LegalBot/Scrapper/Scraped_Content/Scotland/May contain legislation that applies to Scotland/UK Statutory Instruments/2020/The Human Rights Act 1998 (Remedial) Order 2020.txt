It appears to the Secretary of State, following a finding of the European Court of Human Rights in proceedings against the United Kingdom(1), that section 9 of the Human Rights Act 1998(2) is incompatible with an obligation of the United Kingdom arising from the Convention(3).
The Secretary of State considers that there are compelling reasons for proceeding by way of a remedial order(4) to make such amendments to section 9 of the Human Rights Act 1998 as the Secretary of State considers necessary to remove the incompatibility.
In accordance with paragraph 2(a) of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights Act 1998, a draft of this instrument was laid before Parliament and was approved by resolution of each House of Parliament, a document containing a draft of this instrument having previously been laid before Parliament in accordance with paragraph 3(1) of that Schedule.
Accordingly, the Secretary of State makes the following Order, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 10(2) of, and paragraph 1(1)(a) and (b), (2) and (3) of Schedule 2 to, the Human Rights Act 1998.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA”) to address a finding of the European Court of Human Rights of a breach of Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“Convention”) in the case of Hammerton v United Kingdom (Application no. 6287/10).
Article 2 of the Order amends section 9 HRA. Section 9(3) HRA provides that in proceedings under the HRA in respect of a judicial act done in good faith, damages may not be awarded, other than to compensate a person to the extent required by Article 5(5) of the Convention.
Article 2 of the Order enables damages to be awarded under the HRA in respect of a judicial act done in good faith where the judicial act is incompatible with Article 6, and the breach of Article 6 causes the person to be (i) detained when they would not otherwise have been, or (ii) subjected to a longer period of detention than had the breach not been committed.
Article 2 of the Order also provides that the amendments to section 9 HRA apply to judicial acts that occurred before, as well as after, the date on which this Order comes into force.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

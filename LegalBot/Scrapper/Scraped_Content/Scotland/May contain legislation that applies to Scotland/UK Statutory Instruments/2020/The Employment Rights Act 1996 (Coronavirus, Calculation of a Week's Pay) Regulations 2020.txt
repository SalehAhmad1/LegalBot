E is entitled to payment pursuant to section 88 or 89 of the Act as a result of a notice to terminate E's contract of employment given on or after the date on which E became furloughed, for the calculation of that payment under Part 9 of the Act,
(c)
E is entitled pursuant to section 93 of the Act to be paid a sum as a result of a failure by their employer relating to the obligation to provide a written statement giving particulars of the reasons for E's dismissal, and the notice to terminate E's contract of employment was given or (if the dismissal was without notice) the date of termination was on or after the date on which E became furloughed, for the calculation of that sum under Part 9 of the Act,

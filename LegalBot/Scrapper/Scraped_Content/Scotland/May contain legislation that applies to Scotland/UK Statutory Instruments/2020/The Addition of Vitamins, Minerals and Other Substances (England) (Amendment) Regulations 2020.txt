The Secretary of State makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 16(1)(a) and (f), 17(2), 26(1)(a) and (3) and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990(1) and now vested in him(2), as read with paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(3).
The Secretary of State is a Minister designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in relation to measures relating to food (including drink) including the primary production of food(4), and food and drink intended for sale for human consumption including the presentation, packaging, labelling, marketing and advertising of such food and drink(5).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Secretary of State that it is expedient for certain references to provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods(6) to be construed as a reference to those provisions as amended from time to time.
In accordance with section 48(4A) of the Food Safety Act 1990, the Secretary of State has had regard to relevant advice given by the Food Standards Agency(7).
As required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(8) there has been open and transparent public consultation during the preparation and evaluation of these Regulations.

(5) Regulations (“the amending regulations”) may be made under regulation 40A or 76 without such consent, but in such cases the amending regulations must amend regulation 40 or, as the case may be, make provision under regulation 76, in such a way as to avoid altering the effect of that regulation in so far as it applies to–
(a)
devolved Welsh authorities, where the Welsh Ministers have not consented to the making of the amending regulations;
(b)
devolved Northern Ireland authorities, where no Northern Ireland Department has consented to the making of the amending regulations.
(6) Without prejudice to paragraph (7), to the extent that the amending regulations are being made under regulation 40A, the duty imposed by paragraph (5) may be complied with by—
(a)
restructuring regulation 40 (so that, for example, different paragraphs apply to devolved Welsh authorities and other utilities respectively, where the Welsh Ministers have not consented to the making of the amending regulations); and
(b)
amending the powers conferred by regulation 40A so that they refer to the relevant provisions in regulation 22 as so restructured.
(7) Regulations under this Part may make supplementary, incidental, transitional, transitory or saving provision.”.

(1)
For example, regulation 60(2) of the Concession Contracts Regulations 2016 is mentioned only in paragraph 8, which saves its previous wording in certain cases, but that does not prevent the more general saving in paragraph 3 from applying to save the previous wording of regulation 60(2) in other cases; nor does the slight overlap between those paragraphs (in cases in which a contract might, before IP completion day, have been awarded but not yet ‘finalised’ as defined in paragraph (3) affect the interpretation of either saving.

2018 c. 16; sections 7A, 7B, 7C, 8B and 8C were inserted by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1), sections 5, 6, 26(2), 18 and 21 respectively.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace the Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/560 – “the first exit SI”) and the Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulation 2019 (S.I. 2019/623 – “the second exit SI”) which amended the first exit SI. As a result, the revoked Regulations will not come into force.
These Regulations are made partly in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (“the 2018 Act”) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of section 8(2)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. Many of the provisions in these Regulations are unchanged from the first exit SI (as amended by the second exit SI), but additional deficiencies are addressed and some of the original provisions are changed.
These Regulations make amendments in the field of public procurement. Part 2 amends primary legislation. Part 3 amends subordinate legislation. In particular, Chapters 1, 2 and 3 of Part 3 amend the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/102), the Concession Contracts Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/273) and the Utilities Contracts Regulations 2016 (S.I 2016/274), respectively, and Chapter 4 amends other subordinate legislation. Part 4 amends, and in one case revokes, retained direct EU legislation. Part 5 provides for certain rights etc. derived from certain international agreements to cease.
These Regulations are also made partly in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8B(1) of the 2018 Act in order to implement Title 8 (ongoing public procurement and similar procedures) of Part 3 of the withdrawal agreement and the corresponding Title 5 of Part 3 of the EEA EFTA separation agreement(1). In particular, the Schedule to these Regulations differs markedly from the Schedule to the first exit SI in providing for procedures that are ongoing on IP completion day to continue without being subject to any substantive changes in the procurement rules applicable to them. The Schedule also contains various other savings that are unconnected with those agreements.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

Section 8B was inserted by section 18 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1). For the meaning of “withdrawal agreement”, “EEA EFTA separation agreement” and “IP completion day” see section 39(1) of the latter Act.

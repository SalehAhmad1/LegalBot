Laid before Parliament

The Secretary of State makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 45C(1), (3)(c), (4)(d), 45F(2) and 45P of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984(1).
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in England.
The Secretary of State considers that the restrictions contained in the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (North of England) Regulations 2020(2) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (North East and North West of England) Regulations 2020(3) which are imposed in the protected areas as amended by these Regulations, and the restrictions on businesses that are imposed by the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Bolton) Regulations 2020(4), as amended by these Regulations, are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with section 45R of that Act the Secretary of State is of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.

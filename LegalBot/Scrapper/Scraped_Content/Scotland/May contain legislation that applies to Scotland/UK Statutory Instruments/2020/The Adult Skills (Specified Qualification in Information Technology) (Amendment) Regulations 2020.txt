(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Adult Skills (Specified Qualifications) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/733) (“the Adult Skills Regulations”).
Regulation 2(2) inserts regulation 4A into the Adult Skills Regulations. The new regulation 4A confers a function on the Secretary of State to assess a specified qualification in information technology as being of a level specified in Schedule 5 to the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 (“the 2009 Act”).
The result of this is that specified courses in information technology can be provided to a person for free, within the meaning of section 88 of the 2009 Act.
Regulation 2(3) includes specified qualifications in making use of information technology in the lists of specified qualifications which the Secretary of State must make available to the public under regulation 7 of the Adult Skills Regulations.
Regulation 2(4) ensures that specified qualifications in information technology are outside of the existing condition in the Adult Skills Regulations that, in order to benefit from the free provision of facilities, and to be able to undertake the course for free, the person must not be undertaking a specified qualification as part of an apprenticeship.
Regulation 2(5) provides that a condition of being eligible to benefit from the free provision of facilities for a course in information technology, and to be able to undertake the course for free, is that the person must have information technology skills below the level of attainment described in paragraph 5A of Schedule 5 to the 2009 Act.
Regulation 2(6) amends regulation 9 of the Adult Skills Regulations to provide that a person who has previously been awarded a specified qualification in information technology but is assessed by the Secretary of State has having information technology skills below the level of attainment described in paragraph 5A of Schedule 5 to the 2009 Act, is treated as not having that qualification. Regulation 2(6)(a) corrects an error in the Adult Skills Regulations.
Regulation 2(7) amends regulation 10 to allow a training provider to assess whether a person has a skill level in information technology below the level of attainment described in paragraph 5A of Schedule 5 to the 2009 Act. As part of this amendment, regulation 2(7)(b) corrects an incorrect reference to paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to the 2009 Act.
Regulation 2(8) amends regulation 11 to provide that “tuition fees”, for the purposes of the 2009 Act, include the costs of any examination for a qualification in information technology.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

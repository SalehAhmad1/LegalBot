Adjustment in respect of past compensation
20.—(1) This regulation applies in a case where—
(a)
a person is determined to be entitled to victims' payments in respect of disablement suffered by that person or another person, but
(b)
compensation has previously been paid to the person so entitled in respect of that disablement, and
(c)
the compensation referred to in sub-paragraph (b) exceeds the amount of exempted compensation.
(2) The reference in paragraph (1)(b) to the payment of compensation is a reference to the payment of compensation—
(a)
in proceedings on a claim,
(b)
in settlement of a claim (whether or not proceedings on the claim were brought before a court), or
(c)
under a scheme established under a statutory provision.
(3) The Board may, to the extent [F1it] considers appropriate, adjust the amount of victims' payments payable to the person in respect of the amount compensation mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) which is in excess of the amount of exempted compensation.
(4) In considering whether, and to what extent, to exercise the power in paragraph (3), the Board must have regard in particular to —
(a)
the amount of compensation referred to in sub-paragraph (b) which is in excess of the amount of exempted compensation;
(b)
the period of time since any such compensation was paid, and
(c)
any other factor the Board considers relevant.
(5) The exempted amount of compensation is calculated by taking the following three steps.
(6) The first step is to calculate the amount a person would have received had they been entitled to victims' payments from the date of the relevant incident, by multiplying together—
(a)
the number of weeks since the relevant incident, and
(b)
the appropriate rate.
(7) The second step is to adjust the amount calculated under step 1 for inflation, using the ratio published by the Treasury and known as the Gross Domestic Product deflator by reference to the period—
(a)
beginning with the date of the relevant incident, and
(b)
ending with the date of the determination of the person's entitlement to victims' payments.
(8) The third step is to further adjust the amount calculated under step 1 to reflect the time value of money, with reference to the Bank of England base rate.
(9) Subject to paragraph (10), in this regulation “the appropriate rate” has the meaning given by regulation 18.
(10) In a case where disablement is caused by more than one relevant incident—
(a)
the amount of exempted compensation is calculated by taking the sum of calculations carried out under paragraph (5) in respect of each incident, and
(b)
the appropriate rate, in relation to a particular incident, means the rate specified from time to time in column 2 of the table in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to The Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006 corresponding to the assessed degree of disablement attributable to that incident.
(11) The Bank of England base rate means—
(a)
the rate announced from time to time by the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England as the official dealing rate, being the rate at which the Bank is willing to enter into transactions for providing short term liquidity in the money markets, or
(b)
where an order under section 19 of the Bank of England Act 1998 M12 is in force, any equivalent rate determined by the Treasury under that section.

SCHEDULE 2
Assessment of disablement
Assessment of degree of disablement
1.—(1) The degree of the disablement caused by a relevant incident is assessed by making a comparison between the condition of—
(a)
the person so disabled, and
(b)
an average, healthy person of the same age and sex who is not disabled.
(2) In making the comparison in accordance with sub-paragraph (1), the following must not be taken into account—
(a)
the earning capacity of the person so disabled in the person's trade or occupation or any other trade or occupation, and
(b)
the effect of any individual factors or extraneous circumstances.
(3) Where disablement is caused by more than one relevant incident, a composite assessment of the degree of disablement is to be made by reference to the combined effect of all such incidents.
(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), where the sole injury which an applicant suffers as a result of the relevant incident is one specified in column 1 of Schedule 2 to the Social Security (General Benefit) Regulations 1982 (prescribed degrees of disablement), whether or not such injury incorporates one or more other injuries so specified, the assessed degree of disablement suffered by the applicant as a result of that injury is the degree of disablement specified in column 2 of that Schedule.
(5) The degree of disablement assessed in accordance with [F1sub-paragraph (4)] is subject to such increase or reduction of that degree of disablement as may be reasonable in the circumstances of the case where that degree of disablement does not provide a reasonable assessment of the degree of disablement resulting from the relevant incident.
(6) Where the assessed degree of disablement is increased or decreased in accordance with [F2sub-paragraph (5)], the health care professional conducting the assessment must make a record of the reason for the increase or decrease.
(7) For the purpose of assessing the degree of disablement resulting from an injury not specified in Column 1 of Schedule 2 to the Social Security (General Benefit) Regulations 1982, the health care professional may have such regard as the health care professional considers appropriate, to the prescribed degrees of disablement set against injuries specified in that Schedule.

Disablement with other causes
2.—(1) This regulation applies where disablement is caused by a relevant incident but also has a cause (“the other cause”) other than a relevant incident.
(2) In a case where the other cause is a congenital disorder or is an injury received or contracted before the relevant incident, the assessed degree of disablement must take into account all such disablement, except to the extent the applicant would have been subject to that disablement had the relevant incident not occurred.
(3) In a case where the other cause is an injury received or contracted after and not directly attributable to a relevant incident, the assessed degree of disablement must take account of—
(a)
all such disablement to the extent to which the applicant would have been subject to that disablement if the other cause had not arisen, and
(b)
where the extent of disablement would be assessed at not less than 11 percent if that other cause had not arisen, the assessment must also take account of any disablement to which the applicant may be subject as a result of that other cause except to the extent to which the applicant would have been subject to that disablement had the relevant incident not occurred.

(a)
if it is a multiple of 5, as being the next higher percentage which is a multiple of 10, and
(b)
if it is not a multiple of 5, as being the nearest percentage which is a multiple of 10.

Paragraph 29 was inserted by S.S.I. 2013/204.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations establish the Troubles Permanent Disablement Payment Scheme under the law of Northern Ireland.
Regulation 3 establishes the Victims' Payments Board (“the Board”) and regulation 4 sets out principles that the Board must have regard to when exercising functions under these Regulations.
Part 3 of the Regulations makes provision for who is entitled to victims' payments, including the requirements that a person be permanently disabled as a result of injury caused by a Troubles-related incident. Regulation 6 makes provision for circumstances in which a person may, due to a conviction or other exceptional circumstances, not be entitled to victims' payments. Regulation 7 makes further provision about when injury may be said to be caused by a particular incident. A person entitled to victims' payments can nominate someone (their spouse, civil partner, cohabiting partner, or someone with regular and substantial caring responsibilities for them) to receive payments for ten years after their death. If no such person has been nominated, the Board has the power to decide if someone may apply to receive such payments.
Part 4 makes provision for the Board to determine whether someone is entitled to victims' payments and, if so, in relation to which particular incident. The determination is to be made on behalf of the Board by a panel, but the decision of the panel is subject to assessment by a medical health professional as to the degree the applicant has permanent disablement caused by the relevant incident. A health care professional may assess the applicant by considering information (such as medical records), carrying out an examination, or considering a report by another health care professional. In cases where the degree of permanent disablement cannot be assessed, regulation 14 provides for the degree of disablement to be assessed with reference to an interim period.
Part 5 makes provisions regarding payments. The amount of victims' payments a person is entitled to must be determined by the Board. This is done, as per regulation 18, using the table in Part 2 of Schedule 1 to The Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/606), as periodically updated, which sets out amounts of payments corresponding to particular degrees of disablement. Regulation 19 makes provision for this amount to be reduced in respect of other payments in respect of the same disablements, and regulation 20 allows the Board to adjust payments to reflect compensation received in the past and sets out factors the Board must have particular regard to in making such a decision. Regulation 21 provides that if a person applies in the period of three years beginning with the day applications are first advertised as possible, (or longer if the Secretary of State decides) the entitlement to victims' payments will be backdated to the date the applicant would have been entitled to victims' payments if the Scheme had existed since 23 December 2014. Regulation 24 provides that a person can opt to receive a lump sum equal to ten years of victims' payments, instead of regular payments, if they are 60 years old or terminally ill.
Part 6 makes provision regarding the obtaining and use of information by the Board. Regulation 29 allows the Board to require persons, by notice, to provide the Board with the information the Board needs in order to determine applications and appeals. Regulation 30 makes provision restricting the use by the Board of personal data obtained under notice or provided by an applicant and regulation 31 limits the circumstances in which such personal data can be discos disclosed by the Board or any person receiving the information from the Board.
Part 7 provides that determinations by the Board are final, subject to three exceptions. Regulation 33 makes provision for a situation in which a person's condition has worsened, allowing their degree of disablement to be reassessed by a health care professional. Regulation 34 sets out the circumstances in which a person can appeal against a determination or assessment. Regulation 35 provides that appeals are to be determined by an appeal panel of three members and regulation 36 provides that the appeal panel is to reconsider the determination or assessment. Regulation 37 confers on an appeal panel the ability to require that the appellant be reassessed by a health care professional for the purpose of determining the appeal. Regulation 38 provides that the appeal panel's powers include changing a determination or assessment and taking any action that a panel can take. Regulation 39 provides that a hearing can be held if the appellant reasonably requests one or if the Panel thinks it is necessary. Regulations 40, 41 and 42 make provisions for hearings, representation and case management. The third way a determination can be changed is set out in regulation 43, which allows a panel to review decisions in certain circumstances.
Part 8 makes miscellaneous provision. That includes, in regulations 44 and 45, that an applicant or appellant has the burden of proving matters on the balance of probabilities.
Schedule 1 makes provision regarding the Board. The Board is to be a body corporate, with administrative functions exercised on its behalf by a Northern Ireland Department which will also be responsible for providing the Board with staff and accommodation. The Board is to have a President, legal members, medical members and ordinary members and determinations will be taken by panels, consisting of those members, appointed by the President.
Schedule 2 sets out how a health care professional is to assess a person's degree of disablement. Disablement means the loss of physical or mental capacity caused by an injury or illness, whether mental or physical. It is assessed by comparing the person with the disablement with an average, healthy person of the same age and sex, ignoring such matters as occupation. The degree of disablement must be expressed as a percentage.
Schedule 3 makes consequential amendments.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

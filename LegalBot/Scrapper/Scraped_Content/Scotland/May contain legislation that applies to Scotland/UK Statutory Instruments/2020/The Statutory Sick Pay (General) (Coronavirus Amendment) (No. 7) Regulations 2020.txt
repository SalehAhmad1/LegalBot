22nd December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982 (S.I. 1982/894).
Regulation 2(1) to (6) amends Schedule 1 to the 1982 Regulations to reflect changes to the self-isolation requirements where a person has symptoms of coronavirus, tests positive for coronavirus or is a household contact of a person who has coronavirus. These provisions ensure that people who have to self-isolate for these reasons are deemed to be incapable of work for the full period for which they have to isolate.
Regulation 2(7) allows relevant notifications to be given orally and expands the list of people who can issue relevant notifications to include the Scottish and Welsh Ministers.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations in view of the urgency of amending the 1982 Regulations to ensure that people who have to isolate will be deemed incapable of work, and therefore (where other eligibility criteria are satisfied) be eligible to receive Statutory Sick Pay, for the full period of their isolation.

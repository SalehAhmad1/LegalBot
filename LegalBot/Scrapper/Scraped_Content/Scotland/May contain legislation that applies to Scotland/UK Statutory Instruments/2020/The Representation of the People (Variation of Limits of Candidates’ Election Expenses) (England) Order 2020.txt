(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order increases the maximum amount of candidates’ election expenses at local government elections in England, other than elections under the Greater London Authority Act 1999. The increase reflects inflation since the maximum amount was last varied, by the Representation of the People (Variation of Limits of Candidates’ Election Expenses) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/1870).
The maximum amount of candidates’ election expenses consists of a fixed amount (expressed in pounds) plus a sum (expressed in pence) for each entry in the register of electors.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

21st October 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Coronavirus) (Prisoners) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/409) in response to the continuing outbreak of coronavirus in Great Britain.
Those Regulations made provision to enable individuals on temporary release from prison due to the outbreak of coronavirus in Great Britain to access means tested benefits during the period of that release.
Upon the Secretary of State having reviewed the operation of the Social Security (Coronavirus) (Prisoners) Regulations 2020, regulation 2 amends the provision by which those Regulations expire after eight months so that they now expire at the end of the period of 14 months beginning on 13th March 2020.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

At 10.42 a.m. on 23rd March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (“the GPDO”) (S.I. 2015/596).
Article 3 excludes the new permitted development right inserted by article 4 of this Order from the provisions in article 4(1) of the General Permitted Development Order, preventing a local authority and the Secretary of State from directing that development permitted by this Order is not to apply in relation to a specified area.
Article 4 inserts a new permitted development right. This will allow for a time limited (temporary) change of use to the provision of takeaway food, from a use falling within-
(a)
Class A3 (restaurants and cafes) of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/764);
(b)
Class A4 (drinking establishments) of that Schedule;
(c)
a mixed use for any purpose within that Class A3 and A4; or
(d)
Class AA (drinking establishments with enhanced food provision) of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the GPDO.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this Order.

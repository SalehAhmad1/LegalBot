(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Schedule to the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982 (“the 1982 Regulations”). Regulation 2 of the 1982 Regulations provides that a person who is self-isolating in accordance with the Schedule is deemed to be incapable of work.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations adds a new category of person to the Schedule. This is a person who has been notified that they have had contact with a person with coronavirus, and who is self-isolating for 14 days from the latest date on which that contact occurred, or a date specified in the latest notification.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations in view of the urgency required to provide additional financial support to those unable to work as a result of coronavirus.

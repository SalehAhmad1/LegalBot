(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (the “International Travel Regulations”). The International Travel Regulations have been previously amended by:
the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health Information for Persons Travelling to Wales etc.) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/595) (W. 136);
the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Public Health Information to Travellers) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/714) (W. 160);
the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/726) (W. 163); and
the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/804) (W. 177).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales to isolate for a period determined in accordance with the Regulations. The requirements imposed by the International Travel Regulations are subject to exceptions, and certain categories of person are exempt from having to comply. Persons entering Wales after being in one or more of the countries and territories listed in Schedule 3 to the International Travel Regulations are not required to isolate. The countries and territories listed in Schedule 3 are referred to as “exempt countries and territories”.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends the International Travel Regulations to add Estonia, Latvia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Slovakia and Slovenia to the Schedule 3 list of exempt countries and territories.
Regulations 4 and 5 make transitional provision in connection with the change in the countries’ status as exempt countries. These regulations address potential areas of doubt in terms of the effect of the amendments made by regulation 3 on the operation of requirements to isolate imposed by the International Travel Regulations.
Regulation 4 applies where a person is already in Wales and subject to an isolation requirement at the point the amendments in regulation 3 take effect.
In such a case, regulation 4 confirms that the addition of the countries listed in regulation 3 to Schedule 3 to the International Travel Regulations does not curtail the person’s isolation requirement; the person will still have to isolate until the end of the isolation period as initially determined when the person arrived in Wales.
Regulation 5 applies where a person arrives in Wales on or after 31 July 2020 after having been in one of the countries listed in regulation 3 in the 14 days prior to arriving in Wales.
In such a case, for the purpose of determining whether the person is subject to an isolation requirement under the International Travel Regulations, the question of whether the person arrived in Wales from, or having been in, a non-exempt country or territory is to be determined by reference to the status of the country when the person was there last.
This means that if a person leaves a country listed in regulation 3 before 31 July 2020, then arrives in Wales within 14 days (and on or after 31 July 2020), the person will, for the purposes of the International Travel Regulations, be treated as having arrived from, or having been in, a non-exempt country or territory.
Regulation 6 amends the International Travel Regulations to remove Luxembourg from the list of exempt countries and territories.
Regulation 7 makes transitional provision relating to Luxembourg’s change of status. If a person arrives in Wales on or after 31 July 2020 having last been in Luxembourg before that date and within 14 days of arriving in Wales, the person is to be treated for the purposes of regulations 7(1) and 8(1) of the International Travel Regulations has having arrived from, or having been in, a non-exempt country or territory. The person may, therefore, be subject to isolation requirements under the International Travel Regulations.
Regulation 8 adds further events and fixtures to the list of sporting events in Schedule 4 to the International Travel Regulations.
In accordance with regulation 10(4) of the International Travel Regulations, a person that would otherwise be required to isolate in accordance with regulation 7 or 8 of those Regulations may leave the premises at which they are isolating in order to compete etc. at these sporting events.
Regulation 9 of these Regulations corrects the definition of a “sewerage licensee” in Schedule 2 to the International Travel Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely cost and benefit of complying with these Regulations.

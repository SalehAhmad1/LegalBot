17 December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular the deficiencies referred to in paragraphs (a), (d) and (g) of section 8(2)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of plant health. Part 2 amends domestic legislation relating to plant health. Part 3 contains a revocation.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

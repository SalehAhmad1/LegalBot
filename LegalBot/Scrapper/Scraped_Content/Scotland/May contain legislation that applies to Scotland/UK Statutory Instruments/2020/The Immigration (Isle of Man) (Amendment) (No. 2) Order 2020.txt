Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Immigration (Isle of Man) Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/680). It makes amendments to Isle of Man immigration legislation which are equivalent to amendments to UK immigration legislation made by section 10 of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, thus maintaining the Isle of Man’s integrated approach to immigration policy with the United Kingdom.

documentary evidence exists to show that potatoes or host plants have not been grown or were not present in the field in the six years prior to the official investigation;
(ii)
no Potato cyst nematodes have been found during the last two successive official investigations in samples of 1,500 ml soil/hectare and no potatoes or host plants, other than those for which the official investigation is required, have been grown in the field since the first of those two investigations;
(iii)
no Potato cyst nematodes or Potato cyst nematodes without live content have been found in the last official investigation which consisted of a sample size of at least 1,500 ml soil/hectare and no potatoes or host plants, other than those for which the official investigation is required, have been grown in the field since the last official investigation.”.

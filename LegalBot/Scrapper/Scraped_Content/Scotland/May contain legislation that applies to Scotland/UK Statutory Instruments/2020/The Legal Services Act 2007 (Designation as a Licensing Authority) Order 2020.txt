The Legal Services Act 2007 (Approved Regulator) Order 2020 (S.I. 2020/271) designates the Institute as an approved regulator in relation to the administration of oaths. Designation as a licensing authority will allow the Institute to license alternative business structures, such as firms which are wholly or partly owned or controlled by non-lawyers to provide legal services, or a mixture of legal and other services, relating to the administration of oaths, to the public.

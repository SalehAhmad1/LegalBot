Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services under the authority of the Minister for Health and Social Services, one of the Welsh MinistersEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to two sets of Regulations to relax and amend requirements imposed under them. The amendments are being made in order to assist the children's social care sector in response to the outbreak and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wales and cease to have effect on 31 March 2021.
Regulations 3 to 6 make amendments to the Adoption Agencies (Wales) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/1313 (W. 95)), which set out the process for assessing the suitability of people to adopt a child and the suitability of children to be adopted. They make amendments to the approval process for prospective adopters to enable information that must currently be collected during stage 1 of the approval process to be collected during stage 2 and relax the timescale during which certain actions must be undertaken. Regulation 5 corrects typographical errors.
Regulation 8 amends the Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (Wales) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1818 (W. 261)) to extend the period (from 16 to 24 weeks) during which a person related to or otherwise connected with a child may receive temporary approval to act as a local authority foster parent for that child.
Regulation 10 makes savings provision to ensure that some of the amendments made by these Regulations continue to apply in certain circumstances after the expiry of the amendments on 31 March 2021 in accordance with regulation 9.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

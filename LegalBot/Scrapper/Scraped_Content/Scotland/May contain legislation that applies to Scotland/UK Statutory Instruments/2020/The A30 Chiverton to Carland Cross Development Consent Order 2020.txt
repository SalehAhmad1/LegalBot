any alterations to that highway undertaken under powers conferred by this Order prior to and in connection with that de-trunking must, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from the date of de-trunking.
(5) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a special road or a trunk road) over or under another highway, the highway surface must from its completion be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority and the structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority.
(6) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(7) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (6), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.

apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.

the day immediately following that on which further information has been supplied by the undertaker under paragraph 17; or
(c)
such longer period as may be agreed between the parties.

SCHEDULE 6
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS AND IMPOSITION OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation for the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 6 to the A30 Chiverton to Carland Cross Development Consent Order 2020 (the “2020 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 6 to the 2020 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enter on and take possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 29 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 23 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 26(1) (compulsory acquisition of rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 23), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 29(4) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND NOT IN NOTICE TO TREAT
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or a restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 30 (application of the 1981 Act) of the A30 Chiverton to Carland Cross Development Consent Order 2020 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 31(3) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the A30 Chiverton to Carland Cross Development Consent Order 2020 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right of the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or

On street apparatus
3.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus in stopped up streets
4.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 16 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access), any utility undertaker whose apparatus is in the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to the utility undertaker legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the utility undertaker in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of the utility undertaker to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 7 or the power of the undertaker to carry out works under paragraph 9.
(2) Regardless of the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under the powers conferred by article 15 (temporary stopping up and restriction of use of streets), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
5.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 21 (protective works to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
Acquisition of land
6.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
9.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) are to be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker, in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres measured in any direction of any electricity apparatus, the plan to be submitted to the utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) must be detailed, include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which they are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal;
(d)
the position of all electricity apparatus; and
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to such apparatus.
Expenses and costs
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker all expenses reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration) to be necessary then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 5 or 7(2) any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker and, if such consent is withheld, the undertaker has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Cooperation
12.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or a utility undertaker requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 7(2) or a utility undertaker makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 9, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the utility undertaker’s undertaking and each utility undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
13.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

28.—(1) Prior to transferring any benefit of this Order to the local highway authority, the undertaker must (at the sole cost and expense of the undertaker) grant to ScottishPower Renewables permanent and uninterrupted rights in a form acceptable to ScottishPower Renewables—
(a)
to pass and re-pass on foot and with all vehicles over the over-run areas;
(b)
to pass and re-pass on foot and with all vehicles over any part of Work No. 5 not forming part of the public highway; and
(c)
to access, maintain and pass electricity through the re-aligned cables comprised within Work No. 5(m) provided always that no consideration shall be payable by ScottishPower Renewables for or in relation to any such rights.
Costs and expenses
29.  The undertaker will pay to ScottishPower Renewables its proper and reasonable legal costs, professional fees and disbursements incurred in connection with reviewing detailed design information, construction information and any other information submitted to ScottishPower Renewables in respect of the authorised development.
30.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of the authorised development any damage is caused to the Wind Farm or other property of ScottishPower Renewables, or there is any interruption in the supply of electricity from the Wind Farm, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by ScottishPower Renewables in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to ScottishPower Renewables for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by ScottishPower Renewables, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by ScottishPower Renewables on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by ScottishPower Renewables or in accordance with any requirement of ScottishPower Renewables or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of ScottishPower Renewables, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.

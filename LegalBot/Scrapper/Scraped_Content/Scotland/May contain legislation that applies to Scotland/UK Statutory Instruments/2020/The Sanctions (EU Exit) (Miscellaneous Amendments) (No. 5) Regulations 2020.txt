(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
The Regulations make corrections to sanctions regulations which have been made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act, namely the Mali (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/705) (“the Mali Regulations”) and the Afghanistan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/948) (“the Afghanistan Regulations”).
The correction to the Mali Regulations is to substitute in the designation criteria (regulation 6) for the reference to “military goods or military technology” (defined by reference to the Export Control Order 2008 (SI 2008/3231)) a reference to “arms or material related to arms”.
The correction to the Afghanistan Regulations is to insert two sub-paragraphs inadvertently omitted from those Regulations.

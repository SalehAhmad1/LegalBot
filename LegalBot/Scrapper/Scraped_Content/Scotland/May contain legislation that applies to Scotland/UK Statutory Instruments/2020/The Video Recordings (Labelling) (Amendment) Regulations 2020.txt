25th February 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend requirements in the Video Recordings (Labelling) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/1767) (“the 2012 Regulations”) relating to certain classification symbols that must be shown on video recordings or any spool, case or other thing on or in which the recording is kept and other products containing video works for which a classification certificate has been issued by the video works authority.
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 12(1)(d) of the 2012 Regulations by removing the requirement to include the word “restricted” in classification symbols relating to video work which may only be supplied in a licensed sex shop.
Regulation 2(3) amends regulation 13(1) of the 2012 Regulations by reducing the minimum height of the classification symbol required to be shown on video recordings or any spool, case or other thing on or in which the recording is kept and other products containing video works for which a classification certificate has been issued by the video works authority (other than double sided discs) from 5 to 4 millimetres.
Regulation 2(4) amends regulation 13(1)(c) of the 2012 Regulations. The effect is to replace the single under 18 age classification symbol, where the relevant age limit was required to be displayed in red on a white background, with two new symbols; one for the rating from ages 15 but under 18, and the other for age ratings below 15, which must be white and set on pink and orange backgrounds, respectively.
Regulation 3 provides for a six month transitional period during which products may continue to be labelled or marked in accordance with the existing classification symbol requirements. Regulation 3 also makes a saving in respect of products first placed on the market before the entry into force of these Regulations, so that the existing requirements under the 2012 Regulations will continue to apply to such products.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from www.legislation.gov.uk.
These Regulations have been notified in draft to the European Commission in accordance with Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services (OJ No. L 241, 17.9.2015, p. 1).

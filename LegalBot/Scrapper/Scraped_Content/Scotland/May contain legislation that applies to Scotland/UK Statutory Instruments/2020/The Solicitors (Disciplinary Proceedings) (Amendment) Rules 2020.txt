27th April 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Solicitors (Disciplinary Proceedings) Rules 2019 (“the 2019 Rules”).
Rules 4 and 5 amend provisions in rule 3 (interpretation) of the 2019 Rules relating to registered European lawyers. The amendments are required in order to replace references to exit day with references to IP completion day, consequential on the coming into force of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020. There were no ongoing Tribunal proceedings involving European lawyers immediately before exit day and none was started between exit day and the date on which these Rules were made.
Rule 3 and Rules 6 to 20 all contain minor drafting amendments to the 2019 Rules.

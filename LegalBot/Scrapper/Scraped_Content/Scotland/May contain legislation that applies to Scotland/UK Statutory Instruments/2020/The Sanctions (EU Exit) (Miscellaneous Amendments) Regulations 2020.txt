(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
Part 1 makes corrections and amendments to a number of sanctions regulations which have been made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act, namely the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/411), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/433), the South Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/438), the Iran (Sanctions) (Nuclear) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/461), the ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida (United Nations Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/466) and the Counter-Terrorism (International Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/573).
Part 2 makes revocations and amendments which are consequential on the provisions in those sanctions regulations, in particular the revocation of the asset-freezing and export control legislation which has been superseded by those sanctions regulations.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations, as the instrument is intended to ensure existing sanctions remain in place following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. An impact assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and can be found at:

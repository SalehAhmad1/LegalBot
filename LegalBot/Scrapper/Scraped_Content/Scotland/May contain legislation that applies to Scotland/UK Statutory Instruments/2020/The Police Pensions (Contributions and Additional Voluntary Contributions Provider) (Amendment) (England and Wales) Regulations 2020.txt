(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which extend to England and Wales, make amendments to the Police Pensions (Additional Voluntary Contributions) Regulations 1991 (“the 1991 Regulations”) and the Police Pensions Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 substitutes a new approved additional voluntary contributions provider for the purposes of the 1991 Regulations from 1st January 2020. Section 1(5) of the Police Pensions Act 1976 provides for regulations to be framed so as to have effect from a date earlier than the making of the regulations.
Regulation 170 of the 2015 Regulations makes provision for the contributions payable by members of the scheme constituted by the 2015 Regulations to 31st March 2020. Regulation 3 provides for the contribution rates applicable in the scheme year ending on that date to continue to apply for the scheme years to 31st March 2023. Since this involves a change to a protected element of the scheme constituted by the 2015 Regulations, the Secretary of State has consulted representatives of those likely to be affected by the change with a view to reaching agreement and has laid a report before Parliament.
No impact assessment has been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the fields of air quality, environmental protection, international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora, public health and chemicals.

Regulation 4 amends the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2019 to omit an unnecessary amendment to regulation 43 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 1994.

In particular, it makes amendments to two Decisions that establish best available techniques (BAT) conclusions for the purposes of Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and the Council on industrial emissions and two reporting Decisions in respect of air quality.
Regulation 6 amends the REACH etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, which amend retained EU law in the field of chemicals. It substitutes references to “exit day” with references to “IP completion day”, and makes related amendments to defined terms.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

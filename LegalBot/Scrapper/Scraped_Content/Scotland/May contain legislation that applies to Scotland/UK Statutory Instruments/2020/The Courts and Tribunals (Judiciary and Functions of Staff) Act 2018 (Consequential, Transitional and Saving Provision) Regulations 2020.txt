S.I. 2016/709.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Schedule to the Courts and Tribunals (Judiciary and Functions of Staff) Act 2018 (c. 33) (“the 2018 Act”) makes provision for authorised court and tribunal staff to provide legal advice to judges of the family court and justices of the peace, and to exercise judicial functions where procedure rules so provide. That provision includes repealing or amending provision in primary legislation which refers to the offices of a justices' clerk or assistant to a justices' clerk (since those offices will no longer exist as a result of the changes made by the 2018 Act). These Regulations make amendments to secondary legislation in consequence of the provision made by the Schedule to the 2018 Act, and also make transitional and saving provision.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

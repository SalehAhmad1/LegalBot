(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order relates to the Greater Manchester Light Rapid Transit System, also known as Metrolink (the “Metrolink network”).
The Order amends the Greater Manchester (Light Rapid Transit System) (Exemptions) Order 2013 (“the 2013 Order”) by replacing the map contained in the Schedule to that Order with a revised map of the Metrolink network (article 2). The revised map includes a short section of additional track and six new stations that are being constructed. The effect is to extend the exemptions granted by the 2013 Order to the extension of the Metrolink network, construction of which was authorised by the Transport for Greater Manchester (Light Rapid Transit System) (Trafford Park Extension) Order 2016 (S.I. 2016/1035).
A full explanation of the exemptions granted by the 2013 Order, which are extended by this Order, can be found in the Explanatory Note and the Explanatory Memorandum to the 2013 Order. An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no cost to business or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

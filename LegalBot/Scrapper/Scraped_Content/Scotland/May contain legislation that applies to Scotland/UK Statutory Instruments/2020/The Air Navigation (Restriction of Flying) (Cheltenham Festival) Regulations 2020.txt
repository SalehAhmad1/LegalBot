EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in airspace in the vicinity of Cheltenham, 
Gloucestershire, on the occasion of the Cheltenham Festival which is scheduled to take place there 
from 10th to 13th March 2020 (inclusive). In view of the large number of helicopters that will 
operate from the temporary heliport at the Cheltenham race course, the event organiser has 
requested measures to restrict flying in the vicinity for reasons of public safety. This has been 
agreed by the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport. 
In relation to regulation 3, the term ‘aircraft’ includes aircraft as classified by Part 1 of Schedule 4 
to the Air Navigation Order 2016. It also includes, by virtue of article 23 of that Order, any small 
balloon, any kite weighing not more than two kilograms, any small unmanned aircraft and any 
parachute including a parascending parachute. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC), which for the 
purpose of these Regulations is the same as Greenwich Mean Time. 
Full details of the Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice To Airmen (NOTAM).

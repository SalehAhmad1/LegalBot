(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (“the 2018 Act”) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (d), (f) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and under section 8C(1) of the 2018 Act to make provision to implement the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the EU Withdrawal Agreement.
Part 2 provides for a legislative function of the European Commission under Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste to be exercisable instead by public authorities in the United Kingdom.
Part 3 amends primary legislation and Part 4 amends subordinate legislation, including previous instruments made under section 8(1) of the 2018 Act. The amendments relate principally to waste and environmental permitting, and in a few cases to other aspects of the environment.
Part 5 amends or revokes retained EU tertiary legislation relating to resources and waste.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

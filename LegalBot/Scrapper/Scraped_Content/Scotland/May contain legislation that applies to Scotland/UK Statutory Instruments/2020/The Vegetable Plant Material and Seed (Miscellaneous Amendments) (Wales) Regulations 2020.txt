16 June 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend—
the Marketing of Vegetable Plant Material Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/2652) (in relation to Wales only) (“the 1995 Regulations”), and
the Seed Marketing (Wales) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/245) (W. 39) (“the 2012 Regulations”).
These Regulations implement Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/990 amending the list of genera and species in Article 2(1)(b) of Council Directive 2002/55/EC, in Annex II to Council Directive 2008/72/EC and in the Annex to Commission Directive 93/61/EEC (OJ No. L 160, 18.6.2019, p. 14) (“the 2019 Directive”).
The 1995 Regulations implement Council Directive 2008/72/EC on the marketing of vegetable propagating and planting material, other than seed (OJ No. L 205, 1.8.2008, p. 28), and Commission Directive 93/61/EEC setting out the schedules indicating the conditions to be met by vegetable propagating and planting material, other than seed pursuant to Council Directive 2008/72/EC (OJ No. L 250, 7.10.1993, p. 19). The 2012 Regulations implement Council Directive 2002/55/EC on the marketing of vegetable seed.
Regulation 2 updates definitions in the 1995 Regulations to ensure that references to Directives 2008/72/EC and 93/61/EEC refer to those Directives as amended by the 2019 Directive (see section 26 of the Legislation (Wales) Act 2019 (anaw 4)).
Regulation 3 amends the list of vegetable plants and their associated common names in Schedule 1 to the 2012 Regulations (seed to which these Regulations apply) to make explicit where all varieties of a species are included and where only certain varieties of a species are included. It also provides for the application of the 2012 Regulations to hybrids of the species and groups of vegetable plants listed.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

Reg. 16 in force at 1.10.2021, see reg. 1(3)Locations in controlled localities that are reserved locations
17.—(1) A Local Health Board must determine whether premises specified in an application submitted to it under regulation 15 (applications to be included in or make amendment to a pharmaceutical list) or premises or the relevant location from which the applicant wishes to provide pharmaceutical services, specified in an application submitted to it under regulation 18 (applications for preliminary consent and effect of preliminary consent) that are in a controlled locality are also in a reserved location.
(2) Where it has been determined by the Local Health Board, or on appeal by the Welsh Ministers (under paragraph (1) and Schedule 4 respectively) or pursuant to regulation 11 of, or Part 2 of Schedule 3 to, the 2013 Regulations, in relation to premises or a relevant location, from which pharmaceutical services are to be or are being provided, that those premises are or the relevant location is in a reserved location, the person included in the pharmaceutical list in relation to those premises, or that relevant location, may make an application in writing to the Local Health Board to make a further determination as to whether, on the date of the application, those premises are, or that relevant location is, in a reserved location.
(3) For the purposes of this regulation the “relevant location” means, where the location of the premises from which the pharmaceutical services are to be provided is specified in writing by the applicant before the Local Health Board makes its determination, that location, and where that location is not so specified, the best estimate the Local Health Board is able to make of where those premises may be.
(4) Subject to paragraph (5), a reserved location is a location in a controlled locality in respect of which the number of individuals on the patient lists for the area within 1.6 kilometres of the premises or the location of the premises is less than 2,750 persons.
(5) A location is not a reserved location under paragraph (4) if the Local Health Board considers that if a pharmacy were to operate from the location, the extent to which it would be used would be similar to or greater than might be expected if the number of individuals on the patient lists for the area within 1.6 kilometres of the premises or the location were equal to or more than 2,750 persons.
(6) Where in making a further determination applied for in accordance with paragraph (2) the Local Health Board determines that those premises are, or the relevant location is, not in a reserved location, or there is an appeal against a determination by the Local Health Board and it is determined on appeal that the premises are not, or that the relevant location is not, in a reserved location—
(a)
the Local Health Board may determine that the premises are, or the relevant location is, to be treated for the purposes of these Regulations as if they were in a reserved location, where it is of the opinion that not to do so would prejudice the proper provision of primary medical services (other than those provided by the Local Health Board itself), dispensing services or pharmaceutical services in any controlled locality, or
(b)
if the Local Health Board considered that the provision of primary medical services by a provider of primary medical services (other than one employed by the Local Health Board), pharmaceutical services by a NHS pharmacist or NHS appliance contractor, local pharmaceutical services provided under a pilot scheme or pharmaceutical services provided by a doctor is likely to be adversely affected by a determination that the premises are not in a reserved location, it may make such determination but may impose conditions to postpone, for such period as it thinks fit, the making or termination of arrangements under regulation 26 (or equivalent under the GMS Regulations) for the provision by a doctor or GMS contractor of pharmaceutical services or dispensing services to patients.

any other instruments that the Welsh Ministers are required by virtue of these Regulations or the 2006 Act to publish, or which they do publish, together with those determinations,
in the publication known as the Drug Tariff published by the Welsh Ministers in such format as they think fit.
(2) Determinations under section 88 of the 2006 Act by the Welsh Ministers—
(a)
may be made by reference to scales, indices or formulae of any kind, and where a determination falls to be made by reference to any such scale, index or formula, the determination may provide that the relevant price calculation is to be made by reference to the scale, index or formula which is—
(i)
in the form current at the time of the determination, and
(ii)
in any subsequent form taking effect after that time, and
(b)
may take effect in relation to remuneration in respect of a period beginning on or after the date specified in the determination, which may be the date of the determination or an earlier or later date, but it may be an earlier date only if, taking the determination as a whole, it is not detrimental to the persons to whose remuneration it relates.

(6) Payments under the Drug Tariff must be made—
(a)
by the Local Health Board responsible for making the payment, and
(b)
in accordance with arrangements for claiming and making payments which are to be set out in the Drug Tariff but subject, as appropriate, to any deduction that may or must be made from the remuneration of an NHS pharmacist or NHS appliance contractor under these Regulations or any other regulations under the 2006 Act.

55A.—(1) In the case of the drugs or medicines to which paragraph (2) applies, determining authorities must ensure that determinations under section 88 of the 2006 Act (remuneration for persons providing pharmaceutical services) in respect of pharmaceutical remuneration that relates to the supply or administration of those drugs or medicines either—
(a)
do not provide for or permit any reimbursement to be paid for the cost of the drug or medicine (and so the basic price of the drug or medicine, for the purposes of the Drug Tariff, is zero), or
(b)
only provide for or permit nominal reimbursement to be paid for the cost of the drug or medicine.
(2) This paragraph applies to—
(a)
a drug or medicine which is used for vaccinating or immunising people against coronavirus (“a coronavirus vaccine”), if the conditions set out in paragraph (3) are satisfied,
(b)
an antiviral drug or medicine which is used for preventing or treating coronavirus (“a coronavirus antiviral”), if the conditions set out in paragraph (4) are satisfied, or
(c)
a drug or medicine which is used for vaccinating or immunising people against an influenza virus (“an influenza vaccine”), if the conditions set out in paragraph (5) are satisfied.
(3) The conditions set out in this paragraph are—
(a)
either the Welsh Ministers have or the Secretary of State has purchased coronavirus vaccines for supply as part of the health service,
(b)
the Welsh Ministers have made arrangements for all or part of the stock of coronavirus vaccines, purchased as mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), to be supplied to NHS pharmacists, whether directly or via an intermediary, at no cost to the NHS pharmacists,
(c)
a Local Health Board has made arrangements for the administration of coronavirus vaccines from the stock mentioned in sub-paragraph (b) in accordance with any directions given to them by the Welsh Ministers under section 12 of the 2006 Act (functions of Local Health Boards), and
(d)
the coronavirus vaccine in question is from that stock and administered as part of the health service.
(4) The conditions set out in this paragraph are—
(a)
either the Welsh Ministers have or the Secretary of State has purchased coronavirus antivirals of a particular type for supply as part of the health service,
(b)
the Welsh Ministers have made arrangements for all or part of the stock of that particular type of coronavirus antiviral, purchased as mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), to be supplied to NHS pharmacists, whether directly or via an intermediary, at no cost to the NHS pharmacists, and
(c)
the coronavirus antiviral in question—
(i)
is from that stock, or
(ii)
is not from that stock but is nevertheless of the particular type of coronavirus antiviral that is available at no cost to NHS pharmacists under the arrangements mentioned in sub-paragraph (b).
(5) The conditions set out in this paragraph are—
(a)
either the Welsh Ministers have or the Secretary of State has purchased influenza virus vaccines for supply as part of the health service,
(b)
the Welsh Ministers have made arrangements for all or part of the stock of influenza virus vaccines, purchased as mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), to be supplied to NHS pharmacists, whether directly or via an intermediary, at no cost to the NHS pharmacists,

(7) For the avoidance of doubt, determinations under section 88 of the 2006 Act that, in accordance with this regulation—
(a)
do not provide for or permit any reimbursement to be paid for the cost of a drug or medicine (and so the basic price of the drug or medicine, for Drug Tariff purposes, is zero), or
(b)
only provide for or permit nominal reimbursement to be paid for the cost of a drug or medicine,
may nevertheless provide for or permit remuneration to be paid for any service provided by a NHS pharmacist in the course of which the drug or medicine is supplied or administered.
(8) In this regulation—
(a)
“nominal reimbursement” means, in the case of a drug or medicine that has been provided at no cost to a NHS pharmacist, payment of an amount that is paid in place of the amount that the NHS pharmacist would ordinarily make from the difference between—
(i)
the amount that they paid for the drug or medicine when they purchased it, and
(ii)
the amount that they are paid by the relevant Local Health Board in respect of the cost of that drug or medicine (most commonly the basic price listed in the Drug Tariff), if they supply or administer that drug or medicine under arrangements for the provision of pharmaceutical services, and
(b)
“health service” has the meaning given in section 206(1) of the 2006 Act.]

(b)
if the Local Health Board in whose pharmaceutical list the NHS pharmacist is included, or on appeal the Welsh Ministers, has directed that the NHS pharmacist may provide pharmaceutical services at the premises for fewer than 40 hours per week, provided that the NHS pharmacist provides those services at set times and on set days, at the times and on the days so set, or
(c)
if the Local Health Board in whose pharmaceutical list the NHS pharmacist is included, or on appeal the Welsh Ministers, has directed that the NHS pharmacist must provide pharmaceutical services at the premises for more than 40 hours per week, at set times and on set days, at the times and on the days so set, or

for the total number of hours each week required by virtue of that direction, and
(ii)
as regards the additional hours for which the NHS pharmacist is required to provide pharmaceutical services by virtue of that direction, at the days on which and the times at which the NHS pharmacist is required to provide pharmaceutical services during those additional hours, as set out in that direction,
but a Local Health Board may, in appropriate circumstances, agree a temporary suspension of pharmaceutical services for a set period, where it has received 3 months’ notice of the proposed suspension from the NHS pharmacist.
(2) An NHS pharmacist must notify the Local Health Board in whose pharmaceutical list the NHS pharmacist is included of other hours during which the premises from which the NHS pharmacist has undertaken to provide pharmaceutical services will be open, which are hours in addition to those during which the pharmacy is obliged to open by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) (and which are referred to in these Regulations as “supplementary opening hours”).
(3) At each of the premises from which an NHS pharmacist has undertaken to provide pharmaceutical services, the NHS pharmacist must exhibit—
(a)
a notice specifying the times at which the premises are open for the provision of drugs and appliances, and
(b)
at times when the premises are not open, a notice based on information provided by the Local Health Board, legible from outside the premises, specifying the addresses of other NHS pharmacists included in the pharmaceutical list and the times at which drugs and appliances may be obtained from those addresses.
(4) An NHS pharmacist must, on request, submit a return to the Local Health Board on whose pharmaceutical list the NHS pharmacist is included setting out—
(a)
the times at which pharmaceutical services are provided at each of the premises from which the NHS pharmacist has undertaken to provide pharmaceutical services (including the times at which the NHS pharmacist is providing pharmaceutical services when they are not obliged to do so by virtue of sub-paragraph (1)), and
(b)
the pharmaceutical services which the NHS pharmacist ordinarily provides at each of those premises.
(5) Where an NHS pharmacist changes—
(a)
the days on which or the times at which pharmaceutical services are to be provided at premises from which the NHS pharmacist has undertaken to provide pharmaceutical services, or
(b)
the pharmaceutical services which the NHS pharmacist is ordinarily to provide at those premises,
the NHS pharmacist must supply the Local Health Board on whose pharmaceutical list the NHS pharmacist is included with a return informing it of the change.
(6) Where an NHS pharmacist has submitted a return under sub-paragraph (4) or (5) in respect of any premises, or where the NHS pharmacist has set out in an application under these Regulations for inclusion in the pharmaceutical list the days on which and the times at which pharmaceutical services will be provided at the premises to which the application relates if the application is granted—
(a)
the NHS pharmacist must ensure that pharmaceutical services are provided at the premises to which the return or application relates on the days and at the times set out in the return or application (unless the return or application has been superseded by a return, or a further return, under sub-paragraph (5)), and
(b)
the NHS pharmacist must not change—
(i)
the days on which or the times at which pharmaceutical services are to be provided at those premises, or

(10) For the purposes of calculating the number of hours that a pharmacy is open during a week that includes Christmas Day, Good Friday, Easter Sunday or a bank holiday, it must be deemed that the pharmacy was open on that day at the times at which it would ordinarily have been open on that day of the week.
(11) In this Part—
“additional hours” (“oriau ychwanegol”) for which an NHS pharmacist is to be required to provide pharmaceutical services are those hours during which the NHS pharmacist would not be providing pharmaceutical services, were the NHS pharmacist subject to the condition set out in sub-paragraph (1)(a) and not the condition set out in sub-paragraph (1)(d);
“existing direction” (“cyfarwyddyd presennol”) means one that has been made in accordance with this Part or one that was in existence on the date that these Regulations come into force.

Matters to be considered when issuing directions in respect of pharmacy opening hours
24.—(1) Where a Local Health Board issues a direction setting any times or days under this Part, it must in doing so seek to ensure that the hours at which premises are open for the provision of pharmaceutical services are such as to ensure that the pharmaceutical services are provided on such days and at such times as are necessary to meet the needs of people in the neighbourhood, or other likely users of the pharmacy, for pharmaceutical services.
(2) In considering the matters mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) the Local Health Board may have regard to any pharmaceutical services that are being provided in that neighbourhood in circumstances where the NHS pharmacist is not obliged to provide those services.
(3) The Local Health Board may only direct that an NHS pharmacist may provide pharmaceutical services at premises for less than 40 hours in any week if it is satisfied that the provision of pharmaceutical services in the neighbourhood is likely to be adequate to meet the need for such services at times when the NHS pharmacist is not providing pharmaceutical services.
(4) The Local Health Board may only direct that an NHS pharmacist must provide pharmaceutical services at premises for more than 40 hours in any week where it is satisfied that the NHS pharmacist will receive reasonable remuneration in respect of the additional hours for which they are required to provide pharmaceutical services (and any additional remuneration payable in accordance with a determination made as a consequence of regulation 42 in respect of those hours is “reasonable remuneration” for these purposes).

(a)
the NHS appliance contractor must ask any person who makes a declaration that the person named on the prescription form or repeatable prescription does not have to pay the charges specified in regulation 3 of the Charges Regulations (supply of drugs and appliances by chemists) by virtue of either—
(i)
entitlement to exemption under regulation 8 of the Charges Regulations (exemptions), or
(ii)
entitlement to remission of charges under regulation 5 of the Remission of Charges Regulations (entitlement to full remission and payment),
to produce satisfactory evidence of such entitlement unless the declaration is in respect of entitlement to exemption by virtue of regulation 8 of the Charges Regulations or in respect of entitlement to remission by virtue of regulation 5(1)(e) or (2) of the Remission of Charges Regulations and at the time of the declaration such evidence has already been made available to the NHS appliance contractor,
(b)
if, in the case of a non-electronic prescription form or a non-electronic repeatable prescription no satisfactory evidence, as required by paragraph (a), is produced to the NHS appliance contractor, the NHS appliance contractor must endorse the form on which the declaration is made to that effect, and
(c)
in the case of an electronic prescription form or an electronic repeatable prescription, the NHS appliance contractor must comply with any requirements of the ETP service to provide—
(i)
a record of the exemption from or remission of charges claimed and whether satisfactory evidence was produced, as referred to in paragraph (a), and
(ii)
in any case where a charge is due, confirmation that the relevant charge was paid.
(4) Sub-paragraph (3) applies to the provision of an appliance in accordance with a SSP as it applies to the provision of an appliance in accordance with a prescription form or a repeatable prescription (or an associated batch issue), and for these purposes the prescription for product reimbursement purposes, as mentioned in paragraph 5(4)(a), is treated as being the prescription in accordance with which the appliance is provided (even though the supply is not in pursuance of that prescription).

(a)
for not less than 30 hours each week,
(b)
if the Local Health Board in whose pharmaceutical list the NHS appliance contractor is included, or on appeal the Welsh Ministers, have directed (either under this Schedule or Schedule 5 to the 2013 Regulations), that the NHS appliance contractor may provide pharmaceutical services at the premises for fewer than 30 hours per week, provided that those services are provided at set times and on set days, at the times and on the days so set,
(c)
if the Local Health Board in whose pharmaceutical list the NHS appliance contractor is included, or on appeal the Welsh Ministers, have directed (either under this Schedule or Schedule 5 to the 2013 Regulations), that the NHS appliance contractor must provide pharmaceutical services at the premises for more than 30 hours per week, and at set times and on set days, at the times and on the days so set, or
(d)
if the Local Health Board in whose pharmaceutical list the NHS appliance contractor is included, or on appeal the Welsh Ministers, have directed under this Schedule that the NHS appliance contractor must provide pharmaceutical services at the premises for more than 30 hours each week—
(i)
for the total number of hours each week required by virtue of that direction, and
(ii)
as regards the additional hours for which the NHS appliance contractor is required to provide pharmaceutical services by virtue of that direction, at the days on which and times at which the NHS appliance contractor is required to provide pharmaceutical services during those additional hours, as set out in that direction,
but a Local Health Board may, in appropriate circumstances, agree a temporary suspension of pharmaceutical services for a set period, where it has received 3 months’ notice of the proposed suspension.
(2) At each of the premises from which an NHS appliance contractor has undertaken to provide pharmaceutical services, an NHS appliance contractor must exhibit a notice specifying the days on which and times at which the premises are open for the provision of appliances.
(3) An NHS appliance contractor must, on request, submit a return to the Local Health Board setting out—
(a)
the days on which and times at which pharmaceutical services are provided at each of the premises from which the NHS appliance contractor has undertaken to provide pharmaceutical services (including times at which they are providing pharmaceutical services when not obliged to do so by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), which are referred to in these Regulations as “supplementary opening hours”), and
(b)
the pharmaceutical services which the NHS appliance contractor ordinarily provides at each of those premises.
(4) Where an NHS appliance contractor changes—
(a)
the days on which or times at which pharmaceutical services are to be provided at premises from which they have undertaken to provide pharmaceutical services, or
(b)
the pharmaceutical services which they are ordinarily to provide at those premises,
the NHS appliance contractor must supply the Local Health Board with a return informing it of the change.
(5) Subject to sub-paragraph (6), where an NHS appliance contractor is prevented by illness or other reasonable cause from complying with its obligations under sub-paragraph (1) the NHS appliance contractor must, where practicable, make arrangements with one or more NHS appliance contractors, NHS pharmacists or providers of local pharmaceutical services under a pilot scheme whose premises are situated in the neighbourhood for the provision of pharmaceutical services or local pharmaceutical services during that time.
(6) An NHS appliance contractor may make an arrangement with a provider of local pharmaceutical services under a pilot scheme under sub-paragraph (5) only where that provider provides local pharmaceutical services which are of a similar description, and a similar extent to, the pharmaceutical services which the NHS appliance contractor ordinarily provides.
(7) Where there is a temporary suspension in the provision of pharmaceutical services by an NHS appliance contractor for a reason beyond its control, the NHS appliance contractor will not be in breach of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2), provided that the NHS appliance contractor—
(a)
notifies the Local Health Board of that suspension as soon as practicable, and
(b)
uses all reasonable endeavours to resume provision of pharmaceutical services as soon as is practicable.
(8) Planned refurbishment of premises is neither a “reasonable cause” for the purposes of sub-paragraph (5) nor a “reason beyond its control” for the purposes of sub-paragraph (7).
(9) For the purposes of calculating the number of hours that premises are open during a week that includes Christmas Day, Good Friday, Easter Sunday or a bank holiday, it is deemed that the premises were open on that day at the times at which they would ordinarily have been open on that day of the week.

(11) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 14 to 17, during an emergency requiring the flexible provision of pharmaceutical services, a Local Health Board may, on application from an NHS appliance contractor, permit a temporary change to the days on which or times at which the NHS appliance contractor is obliged to provide pharmaceutical services at the premises from which they have undertaken to provide pharmaceutical services, or permit temporary closure of those premises, if—
(a)
the NHS appliance contractor gives at least 24 hours’ notice of the change or closure, and
(b)
the reasons given by the NHS appliance contractor for the request are, in the opinion of the Local Health Board, adequate reasons.
(12) The Local Health Board need not approve the request referred to in sub-paragraph (11), in advance of the change or closure, and if it does not do so but decides subsequently that the NHS appliance contractor’s reasons are not, in its opinion, adequate reasons, then the days on which or times at which the NHS appliance contractor is obliged to provide pharmaceutical services at the premises are to revert to the overridden days and times, from the day after the date on which that decision is given to the NHS appliance contractor.

Matters to be considered when issuing directions in respect of opening hours
14.—(1) Where a Local Health Board issues a direction setting any days or times under this Schedule, it must in doing so seek to ensure that the hours at which premises are open for the provision of pharmaceutical services are such as to ensure that pharmaceutical services are provided on such days and at such times as are necessary to meet the needs of people in the neighbourhood, or other likely users of the premises, for pharmaceutical services.
(2) In considering the matters mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), the Local Health Board—
(a)
must treat any local pharmaceutical services being provided in that neighbourhood at the days and times in question as if they were pharmaceutical services being so provided, and
(b)
may have regard to any pharmaceutical services that are being provided in that neighbourhood in circumstances where the person providing the pharmaceutical services is not obliged to provide those services.
(3) The Local Health Board may only direct that an NHS appliance contractor may provide pharmaceutical services at premises for less than 30 hours in any week if it is satisfied that the arrangements for the supply of appliances in the neighbourhood are likely to be adequate to meet the need for such services at times when the NHS appliance contractor is not providing pharmaceutical services.
(4) A Local Health Board may only direct that an NHS appliance contractor must provide pharmaceutical services at premises for more than 30 hours in any week if a Local Health Board is satisfied that the NHS appliance contractor will receive reasonable remuneration in respect of the additional hours for which they are required to provide pharmaceutical services (and any additional remuneration payable under the Drug Tariff in respect of those hours is “reasonable remuneration” for these purposes).

(a)
people in the neighbourhood, or
(b)
other likely users of the NHS appliance contractor’s premises,
for the supply of appliances, it may carry out an assessment as to whether to issue a direction requiring the NHS appliance contractor to provide pharmaceutical services at the premises at set times and on set days (which may include Christmas Day, Good Friday, Easter Sunday and bank holidays).

8.—(1) A dispensing doctor may refuse to provide the drugs or appliances ordered on a prescription form or repeatable prescription where—
(a)
the dispensing doctor reasonably believes that it is not a genuine order for the person named on the prescription form or the repeatable prescription (for example, because the dispensing doctor reasonably believes that it has been stolen or forged), or
(b)
it appears to the dispensing doctor that there is an error on the prescription form or on the repeatable prescription or its associated batch issue (including a clinical error made by the prescriber), or that, in the circumstances, providing the drugs or appliances would be contrary to the dispensing doctor’s clinical judgement.

(a)
the dispensing doctor or other persons on the premises are subjected to or threatened with violence by the person presenting the prescription or repeatable prescription, or by any person accompanying that person, or
(b)
the person presenting the prescription form or repeatable prescription, or any other person accompanying that person, commits or threatens to commit a criminal offence.

(a)
the dispensing doctor has no record of that prescription,
(b)
it is not signed by a repeatable prescriber,
(c)
to do so would not be in accordance with any intervals specified in the prescription,
(d)
it would be the first time a drug or appliance had been provided pursuant to the prescription and the prescription was signed more than 6 months previously,
(e)
if the repeatable prescription was signed more than 1 year previously,
(f)
the expiry date on the repeatable prescription has passed, or
(g)
where the dispensing doctor has been informed by the repeatable prescriber that the prescription is no longer required.
(4) Where the patient requests the supply of drugs or appliances ordered on a repeatable prescription (other than on the first occasion that the patient makes such a request), a dispensing doctor may only provide the drugs or appliances ordered if satisfied—
(a)
that the patient to whom the prescription relates—
(i)
is taking or using, and is likely to continue to take or use, the drug or appliance appropriately, and
(ii)
is not suffering from any side effects of the treatment which indicates the need or desirability of reviewing the patient’s treatment,
(b)
that the medication regimen of the patient to whom the prescription relates has not altered in a way that indicates the need or desirability of reviewing the patient’s treatment, and
(c)
that there have been no changes to the health of the patient to whom the prescription relates which indicate the need or desirability of reviewing the patient’s treatment.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) (Wales) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/898) (“the 2013 Regulations”) as the Regulations which, in Wales, govern the provision of pharmaceutical services as part of the National Health Service under Part 7 of the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006.
Part 1 contains introductory provisions, including setting different dates on which provisions come into force. Parts 1 to 4 and Parts 9 to 11 come into force on 1 October 2020. Parts 5 to 8 come into force on 1 October 2021.
Part 2 sets out the requirements relating to the production of pharmaceutical needs assessments (“PNAs”). A PNA is a statement of the assessment that each Local Health Board must make, at least every 5 years, of the needs in its area for pharmaceutical services provided as part of the National Health Service in Wales. This Part includes the consultation requirements that have to be fulfilled before a PNA is completed and published (regulation 7) and the matters to which a Local Health Board must have regard when producing a PNA (regulation 8) – and Schedule 1 thereafter sets out the information that must be included in PNAs. Pending full revision of a PNA, a Local Health Board may address, in a supplementary statement, changes to the availability of pharmaceutical services since the PNA was published (regulation 6). A Local Health Board is required to publish its PNA and any subsequent PNAs on its website (regulation 9).
Part 3 sets out the requirements for each Local Health Board to prepare and maintain for their area—
(a)
pharmaceutical lists of NHS pharmacists and NHS appliance contractors who undertake to provide pharmaceutical services from premises in the area, and
(b)
dispensing doctor lists of doctors who undertake to provide pharmaceutical services from premises in the area.
It also sets out the terms of service, which are the terms on which persons are included in a pharmaceutical or dispensing doctor list and on which they undertake to provide pharmaceutical services as part of the National Health Service.
Part 4 makes provision for a Local Health Board itself, or on application from a Local Medical Committee or Local Pharmaceutical Committee, to determine whether or not a particular area within the area for which the Local Health Board is established is, because it is rural in character, a controlled locality or part of a controlled locality. The significance of a locality being determined to be a controlled locality is that, in certain circumstances, doctors can provide pharmaceutical services to certain of their eligible patients (if those doctors are included in a dispensing doctor list). The procedures that a Local Health Board must follow in determining a question as to whether an area is a controlled locality or part of a controlled locality are set out in Schedule 3. Rights of appeal to the Welsh Ministers in respect of decisions made by Local Health Boards are set out in Schedule 4.
Part 5 sets out the types of applications in respect of inclusion in or amendment to pharmaceutical lists and the tests which a Local Health Board must apply to determine those applications. Under regulation 15 (applications to be included in or make amendment to a pharmaceutical list) and regulation 18 (applications for preliminary consent and effect of preliminary consent) applications can be granted only if the Local Health Board is satisfied that it would meet a need for pharmaceutical services, or pharmaceutical services of a specified type, in the area of the relevant Local Health Board and which have been included in the PNA of that Local Health Board. In addition, the general position is that if the premises are situated in a controlled locality, the Local Health Board must be satisfied that to grant the application will not prejudice the proper provision of primary medical, dispensing or pharmaceutical services in any locality (the prejudice test). The exception to the general position is where the premises specified in an application are determined by the Local Health Board to be in a reserved location (under regulation 17 (locations in controlled localities that are reserved locations)).
A person already included in a pharmaceutical list can apply to relocate the premises from which they provide pharmaceutical services. Regulation 19 (applications involving relocation within a Local Health Board’s area) sets out when a Local Health Board may grant such an application. Applications that fall within regulation 20 (applications involving relocation between neighbouring Local Health Board areas), regulation 21 (applications involving a temporary relocation) and regulation 22 (applications involving a change of ownership) will be assessed in accordance with the specific criteria set out in the provisions of those regulations. The procedures that a Local Health Board must follow in determining applications under Part 5 are set out in Schedule 3, and rights of appeal to the Welsh Ministers in respect of decisions made by Local Health Boards are set out in Schedule 4.
Part 6 sets out the applications which doctors can make in order to be able to fulfil the conditions on which they can then make arrangements with a Local Health Board to provide pharmaceutical services to their eligible patients in controlled localities. Doctors must apply for outline consent and premises approval under regulation 30 (outline consent and premises approval) and Local Health Boards must consider such applications in accordance with the prejudice test and the proximity of the premises from which the doctor wishes to provide pharmaceutical services to nearby pharmacies. A doctor who has been granted outline consent and premises approval may make arrangements with a Local Health Board to provide pharmaceutical services under regulation 26 (arrangements for the provision of pharmaceutical services by doctors). The procedures that a Local Health Board must follow in determining applications under Part 6 are set out in Schedule 3, and rights of appeal to the Welsh Ministers in respect of decisions made by Local Health Boards are set out in Schedule 4.
Part 7 deals with fitness grounds and inclusion in and removal from pharmaceutical lists. It provides for the deferral and refusal of applications for inclusion in a pharmaceutical list on fitness grounds (regulations 36 and 37) together with an inclusion in a pharmaceutical list being subject to conditions (regulation 38). For certain fitness matters, including where a person has been convicted in the United Kingdom of a criminal offence and has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of over 6 months, a Local Health Board must remove a person from a pharmaceutical list pursuant to regulation 40 (removal from a pharmaceutical list for other reasons).
Part 8 sets out some conditions that are to be imposed on NHS pharmacists and NHS appliance contractors as part of their terms of service with the Local Health Board, which include requirements relating to co-operation with the Local Health Board over local resolution of disputes (regulation 49). These Part 8 conditions are in addition to the principal terms of service for NHS pharmacists, which are in Schedule 5, and NHS appliance contractors, which are in Schedule 6.
The terms of service in Schedule 5 include obligations to provide what are described as the essential services that must be provided at each pharmacy. These essential services include not only dispensing services but other services, for example disposal services in respect of unwanted drugs and promotion of healthy lifestyles. As well as providing essential services, NHS pharmacists are subject to other compulsory requirements by virtue of Schedule 5, for example with regard to having acceptable systems of clinical governance and providing information about fitness matters. The range of necessary services required of NHS appliance contractors in Schedule 6 is more limited, but also includes requirements with regard to dispensing and additional compulsory requirements with regard to clinical governance and providing information about fitness matters. Both of these types of provider of pharmaceutical services are also subject to detailed requirements with regard to their opening hours and changes to them. Schedules 5 and 6 also set out the NHS terms of service for NHS pharmacists and NHS appliance contractors in relation to Serious Shortage Protocols (SSPs), where when a SSP is in place, the NHS pharmacist or NHS appliance contractor must consider whether it is reasonable and appropriate to supply in accordance with the SSP rather than fulfilling the NHS prescription for that product.
Part 9 sets out the arrangements for dealing with breaches of terms of service by NHS pharmacists and NHS appliance contractors (breaches by dispensing doctors are dealt with under their parallel arrangements for providing primary medical services to registered patients, which they must have in order to be providers of pharmaceutical services). Where a dispute between an NHS pharmacist, or an NHS appliance contractor, and the Local Health Board cannot be resolved under the local dispute resolution procedures (or where that procedure may be by-passed), the NHS pharmacist or NHS appliance contractor faces the possibility of a breach or remedial notice, as a part of which there may be a payment withholding (regulations 50 to 52). In some cases, repeated failures to comply with terms of service, or failures with particularly serious consequences, may thereafter lead to the removal of an NHS pharmacist’s or NHS appliance contractor’s business premises from the relevant pharmaceutical list (regulation 53).
Part 10 deals with payments to NHS pharmacists and NHS appliance contractors. Regulation 55 (the Drug Tariff and remuneration of NHS pharmacists and NHS appliances contractors) provides for the publication of the Drug Tariff, the main statement of the financial entitlements of NHS pharmacists and NHS appliances contractors that sets out the determinations on such matters made by the Welsh Ministers as determining authority. Regulation 56 (Local Health Boards as determining authorities) makes provision for the Local Health Boards to be determining authorities where this is set out in the Drug Tariff. There are also provisions for supplemental matters including overpayments and payments to NHS pharmacists and NHS appliance contractors.
Part 11 deals with miscellaneous matters, including transitional provisions for applications and appeals made under the 2013 Regulations before and after these Regulations come into force, as well as setting out the different dates on which provisions within the 2013 Regulations are revoked.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Department for Health and Social Services, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

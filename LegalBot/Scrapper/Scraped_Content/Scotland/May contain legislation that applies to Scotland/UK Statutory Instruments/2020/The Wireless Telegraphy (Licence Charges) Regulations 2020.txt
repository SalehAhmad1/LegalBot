SCHEDULE 3
FORMULA FOR CALCULATING THE APPROPRIATE SUM FOR THE POINT TO POINT FIXED LINKS LICENCE
PART 1
FORMULA
1.  In this Schedule—
(a)
“the appropriate sum” means the amount in pounds sterling, which is payable for a Point to Point Fixed Links licence, calculated in accordance with the formula set out in paragraph 2; and
(b)
“Availability” means the minimum percentage of time that the fixed link is capable of functioning as set out in the licensee’s licence.

Sch. 3 para. 1 in force at 21.10.2020, see reg. 1
2.  The formula is—
where—
“AS” means the appropriate sum;
“Avf” means the Availability Factor, being the number in Column 2 of the table set out in Part 5 as determined by the Availability (in per cent) as set out in Column 1 of that table;
“Bf” means the Band Factor, being the number in Column 2 of the table set out in Part 2 as determined by the range of frequency band (in GHz), if any, of a fixed link set out in Column 1 of that table in which the licensee’s band falls as declared by the licensee on application for a licence;
“Bwf” means the Bandwidth Factor, subject to paragraph 3, being the number corresponding to the bandwidth (in MHz) of a co-ordinated two-way fixed link (or a part thereof) as declared by the licensee on application for a licence;
“MPL” means the Minimum Path Length, being the number corresponding to the applicable (depending on the amount of data that can be transmitted over the bandwidth (“the data rate”) or over the channel width for analogue systems) length of the path (in kilometres) specified in Columns 2 and 3 of tables 1 or 2 set out in Part 4 as determined by the range of frequency band (in GHz), if any, of a fixed link set out in Column 1 of those respective tables in which the licensee’s band falls as declared by the licensee on application for a licence;
“PL” means the Path Length, being the number corresponding to the distance (in kilometres) between two fixed points of the link as declared by the licensee on application for a licence;
“Plf” means the Path Length Factor, being the number in Column 2 of the table set out in Part 3 as determined by the relationship between the PL and the MPL as set out in Column 1 of that table except for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, where Plf is 1; and
“Sp” means the Spectrum Price, being a fixed sum of £88 per 2 x 1 MHz bandwidth for each co-ordinated two-way fixed link.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace the Wireless Telegraphy (Licence Charges) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1128 as amended by S.I.s 2012/1075, 2013/917, 2014/1295, 2015/1334, 2015/1995 and 2016/643) (“the 2011 Regulations”). These Regulations provide for charges to be paid to the Office of Communications (“OFCOM”) in respect of wireless telegraphy licences granted under section 8 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (c. 36) (“the Act”).
These Regulations set the charges - licence fees - for most classes of wireless telegraphy licence (regulation 4 and Schedule 2). They also provide for pro-rated licence fees, subject to a minimum of £32 in the case of Shared Access licences and otherwise £20, for licences issued for less than one year where the fees for a full year’s licence would otherwise be £75 or more (regulation 4).
For most licence classes the Regulations set the same fees as under the 2011 Regulations, but there are three changes.
The first change is that they introduce fees for new licence classes in Schedule 2: the Local Access, Shared Access (Low Power) and Shared Access (Medium Power) licence classes listed under the heading “Spectrum Access” and the Network 2 GHz licence class listed under the heading “Satellite Services”.
The second change is that, in respect of the Self Co-ordinated Links licence class in Schedule 2, they remove reference to 65 GHz which frequency is no longer available for this licence class.
They also rename two licence classes listed under the heading “Science and Technology” (the Non-Operational Temporary Use licence class, which is renamed the Demonstration and Trial licence class, and the Non-Operational Development licence class, which is renamed the Innovation and Research licence class) (regulation 4(2)(a)(iii) and Schedule 2).
Regulation 5 provides for concessionary fees for certain wireless telegraphy licences held by charities whose object is the safety of human life in an emergency. Regulation 5(3) refers to the Association of Guernsey Charities. Information about the Association of Guernsey Charities is on its website at http://www.charity.org.gg/.
Regulation 6 provides that, where a sum is not prescribed by regulations made under section 12 of the Act, there shall be paid to OFCOM such sum as OFCOM may in the particular case determine.
Copies of the 2nd series of Landranger maps published by the Ordnance Survey, referred to in regulation 2(1), are available from the Ordnance Survey’s website at www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk.

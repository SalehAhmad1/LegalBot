CHAPTER 1
Installations
Allocation tables
34A.—(1) The UK ETS authority must compile a table (an “allocation table”) for each allocation period as soon as reasonably practicable after approval under Article 16b of the Free Allocation Regulation of the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of installations—
(a)
in the case of the allocation table for the 2021-2025 allocation period, in respect of which a deemed application for free allocation in the 2021-2025 allocation period (as defined in Article 2(19) of that Regulation) is made;
(b)
in the case of the allocation table for the 2026-2030 allocation period, in respect of which an application for free allocation in the 2026-2030 allocation period is made under Article 4 of that Regulation.
(2) The allocation table for the 2021-2025 allocation period must contain an entry for each relevant installation.
(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2), an installation is a “relevant” installation if—
(a)
a deemed application for free allocation in the 2021-2025 allocation period (as defined in Article 2(19) of the Free Allocation Regulation) is made in respect of the installation that the UK ETS authority subsequently informs the regulator is valid; or
(b)
an application for free allocation in the 2021-2025 allocation period is made in respect of the installation under Article 5(1)(a) of the Free Allocation Regulation that the UK ETS authority subsequently informs the regulator is valid.
(4) But an installation referred to in paragraph (3)(a) is not a “relevant” installation if—
(a)
the installation is included in the hospital and small emitter list for 2021-2025 or the ultra-small emitter list for 2021-2025;
(b)
the installation ceases operation (within the meaning of GGETSR 2012) on or before 31st December 2020; or
(c)
the installation's permit (within the meaning of GGETSR 2012) is revoked under regulation 14 of GGETSR 2012 on or before that date.
(5) The allocation table for the 2026-2030 allocation period must contain an entry for each relevant installation.
(6) For the purposes of paragraph (5), an installation is a “relevant” installation if—
(a)
an application for free allocation in the 2026-2030 allocation period is made in respect of the installation under Article 4 of the Free Allocation Regulation that the UK ETS authority subsequently informs the regulator is valid; or
(b)
an application for free allocation in the 2026-2030 allocation period is made in respect of the installation under Article 5(1)(b) of the Free Allocation Regulation that the UK ETS authority subsequently informs the regulator is valid.
(7) But an installation referred to in paragraph (6)(a) is not a “relevant” installation if—
(a)
the installation is included in the hospital and small emitter list for 2026-2030 or the ultra-small emitter list for 2026-2030;
(b)
the installation ceases operation on or before 31st December 2025; or
(c)
the installation's permit is revoked under paragraph 12 of Schedule 6 on or before that date.
(8) The entry for an installation must set out—
(a)
the installation identifier used in the registry;
(b)
for each scheme year in the allocation period, the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for the scheme year, in 3 columns as follows (see article 34B)—
(i)
column A (standard free allocation);
(ii)
column B (new entrants' reserve);
(iii)
column C (total).
Allocation tables: supplementary
34B.—(1) This article applies for the purposes of article 34A(8)(b).
(2) Where the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of an installation is approved under Article 16b of the Free Allocation Regulation, that number must be included in column A.
(3) Where the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of an installation is approved under Article 18a of that Regulation, that number must be included in column B.
(4) Paragraphs (5) and (6) apply where a calculation (a “relevant calculation”) of the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for a scheme year is approved by the UK ETS authority under either or both of the following—
(a)
Article 24(3)(a)(ii) of the Free Allocation Regulation (renunciation other than in respect of whole installation);
(b)
Article 6a of the Activity Level Changes Regulation.
(5) If the effect of the relevant calculation is a final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for the scheme year that is greater than the number that would otherwise be set out in the entry for the installation for the scheme year, the net increase must be added to the amount that would otherwise be included in column B.
(6) If the effect of the relevant calculation is a final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for the scheme year that is less than the number that would otherwise be set out in the entry for the installation for the scheme year, the net decrease must be deducted first from any amount that would otherwise be included in column B, before being deducted from any amount that would otherwise be included in column A.
(7) The total final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for the scheme year (that is to say, the sum of columns A and B) must be included in column C.
Allocation tables: updates
34C.—(1) The UK ETS authority must update an allocation table to take account of any approval of the UK ETS authority under—
(a)
Article 18a of the Free Allocation Regulation (new entrants);
(b)
Article 6a of the Activity Level Changes Regulation (activity level changes);
(c)
Article 24 of the Free Allocation Regulation (renunciation);
(d)
Article 25 of that Regulation (mergers and splits);
(e)
Article 26 of that Regulation (cessation);
(f)
article 34H of this Order (installations: errors in applications for free allocation, etc.).
(2) To avoid doubt, the UK ETS authority may update an allocation table under paragraph (1) so as to increase or reduce the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of an installation for a scheme year after allowances have already been allocated in respect of the installation for the scheme year under article 34E. (See article 34S in relation to the return of allowances where the number of allowances to be allocated in respect of an installation for a scheme year is reduced after allowances for the scheme year have been allocated, for example, because of a decrease in activity levels.)
Allocation tables: publication, etc.
34D.—(1)  The UK ETS authority must notify the registry administrator of an allocation table as soon as reasonably practicable after it is compiled and of an updated allocation table as soon as reasonably practicable after it is updated.
(2) The UK ETS authority must publish the allocation table for the 2021-2025 allocation period as soon as reasonably practicable after it is compiled and in any event before 30th June 2021.
(3) The UK ETS authority must publish the allocation table for the 2026-2030 allocation period as soon as reasonably practicable after it is compiled and in any event before 1st January 2026.
(4) The UK ETS authority must publish an updated allocation table as soon as reasonably practicable after the allocation table is updated.
(5) Paragraphs (2) to (4) are subject to article 75C (national security).
Allocation of allowances
34E.—(1) The registry administrator must allocate allowances in respect of an installation in accordance with the allocation table by transferring allowances to the operator holding account for the installation.
(2) Allowances—
(a)
for the 2021 scheme year must be allocated as soon as reasonably practicable after the allocation table for the 2021-2025 allocation period is published;
(b)
for any other scheme year must be allocated on or before 28th February in that year.
(3) Where, after allowances for a scheme year have been allocated in respect of an installation in accordance with paragraph (2), an update to the allocation table results in an increase in the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for the scheme year, the increased number of allowances must be allocated as soon as reasonably practicable.
(4) This article is subject to—
(a)
article 34F (no allocation unless monitoring methodology plan approved);
(b)
article 34G(2) (new entrants' reserve);
(c)
article 34W (notice to withhold allowances).
No allocation unless monitoring methodology plan approved
34F.—(1) Where a monitoring methodology plan has not been approved in relation to an installation under Article 8 of the Free Allocation Regulation, the regulator may, by notice to the registry administrator, require the registry administrator to withhold allowances that would otherwise have been allocated in respect of the installation under article 34E.
(2) Where a notice under paragraph (1) is given, no allowances may be allocated in respect of the installation set out in the notice until the regulator gives a further notice to the registry administrator, which must be given as soon as reasonably practicable after a monitoring methodology plan is approved.
New entrants' reserve
34G.—(1) The new entrants' reserve is a reserve of 30,249,066 allowances for the trading period.
(2) The number of allowances set out in column B of an allocation table must be allocated from the new entrants' reserve until the new entrants' reserve is exhausted, after which no allocation may be made for a scheme year in respect of allowances set out in that column.
(3) Where an allocation table or an updated allocation table requires an allocation to be made from the new entrants' reserve in respect of more than one installation, allowances must be allocated in accordance with paragraphs (4) and (5) (until the new entrants' reserve is exhausted).
(4) Allowances must first be allocated in respect of sub-installations of installations in respect of which the historical activity level of the sub-installation has been determined under Article 17(1) of the Free Allocation Regulation or Article 3a(2) of the Activity Level Changes Regulation, in chronological order of the date (and, where relevant, time) on which the operator submitted sufficient information to enable the historical activity level of the sub-installation to be determined.
(5) Allowances must next be allocated in respect of sub-installations of installations in respect of which the historical activity level of the sub-installation has not been so determined, in chronological order of the date (and, where relevant, time) on which the operator submitted sufficient information to enable the activity level of the sub-installation to be determined for the purposes of Article 18(2) of the Free Allocation Regulation or under Article 3a(3) of the Activity Level Changes Regulation.
(6) Where allowances to which a person is not entitled (see article 34S) are allocated from the new entrants' reserve, for the purposes of this article, those allowances must be treated as not having been allocated from the new entrants' reserve, to the extent that an equal number of allowances are transferred or returned in accordance with a notice under article 34U or 34V.
(7) For the purposes of this article, each regulator must—
(a)
keep such records as the regulator considers appropriate to enable the chronological order referred to in paragraph (4) or (5) to be determined;
(b)
provide any information required by the UK ETS authority or the registry administrator to enable allowances to be allocated in accordance with this article.
(8) In this article, “historical activity level” and “sub-installation” have the same meanings as in the Free Allocation Regulation.
Installations: errors in applications for free allocation, etc.
34H.—(1) This article applies where the regulator considers that, as a result of a relevant error—
(a)
the final annual number of allowances set out in an allocation table to be allocated in respect of an installation for a scheme year; or
(b)
the number of allowances allocated in accordance with an allocation table under article 34E in respect of an installation for a scheme year,
is materially greater, or materially less, than the number that would otherwise have been set out in the table but for the relevant error.
(2) In this article, “relevant error” means—
(a)
an error in an application for free allocation made in respect of an installation under Article 4 or 5 of the Free Allocation Regulation (including a deemed application for free allocation in the 2021-2025 allocation period as defined in Article 2(19) of that Regulation);
(b)
an error in an activity level report submitted by the operator of an installation under the Activity Level Changes Regulation;
(c)
an error of the regulator or the UK ETS authority in the exercise of functions under this Order (including under this article), the Free Allocation Regulation or the Activity Level Changes Regulation.
(3) The regulator may do any of the following—
(a)
determine the historical activity level of a sub-installation of the installation that the regulator considers would have been determined for the purposes of the UK ETS but for the relevant error;
(b)
calculate the preliminary annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of a sub-installation of the installation for the scheme year that the regulator considers would have been calculated for the purposes of the UK ETS but for the relevant error;
(c)
calculate the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of a sub-installation of the installation for the scheme year that the regulator considers would have been calculated for the purposes of the UK ETS but for the relevant error.
(4) For the purposes of paragraph (3), the regulator may make a conservative estimate of the value of any relevant parameter; and if the regulator does so, the regulator must give notice of the value to the operator.
(5) Where the regulator does any of the things referred to in paragraph (3), the regulator must send to the UK ETS authority—
(a)
details of the relevant error;
(b)
any determination or calculation referred to in paragraph (3);
(c)
the regulator's recalculation of the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation of which the sub-installation is part for the scheme year, taking account of the determination or calculation referred to in paragraph (3).
(6) If the UK ETS authority considers that, as a result of the relevant error, the final annual number of allowances set out in an allocation table to be allocated in respect of an installation for a scheme year, or the number of allowances allocated in accordance with an allocation table under article 34E in respect of an installation for a scheme year, is materially greater, or materially less, than the number that would otherwise have been set out in the table but for the relevant error, the UK ETS authority must—
(a)
approve the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for the scheme year, making any corrections to the historical activity level, preliminary annual number of allowances or final annual number of allowances determined or calculated by the regulator that the UK ETS authority considers appropriate; and
(b)
inform the regulator accordingly.
(7) The regulator must give notice to the operator of the installation—
(a)
of the relevant error;
(b)
of the final annual number of allowances approved;
(c)
where the relevant error was the error of including an entry for the installation in an allocation table for an allocation period, that the installation is not an FA installation for the allocation period.

CHAPTER 2
Aviation
Interpretation
34I.—(1) In this Chapter—
“Annex 1 activities” means activities listed under “Aviation” in Annex 1 to the Directive;
“attributable” must be construed in accordance with article 34J(4);
“aviation free allocation entitlement” must be construed in accordance with article 34K;
“business reorganisation” must be construed in accordance with paragraph (2);
“historical aviation activity level” has the meaning given in article 34J;
“special reserve application” means an application for a free allocation of allowances under the EU ETS from the special reserve referred to in Article 3f of the Directive;
“tonne-kilometre” has the meaning given in Article 3(3) of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018;
“transferor”, “transferee” and “relevant transferee” must be construed in accordance with paragraph (2).
(2) For the purposes of this Chapter—
(a)
where a part of a person's business responsible for performing an aviation activity has been transferred to another person, the person has been subject to a “business reorganisation” that affects the aviation activity; and, in relation to the aviation activity, the first person is the “transferor” and the second person is a “transferee”;
(b)
where there has been a business reorganisation affecting an aviation activity, a transferee is the “relevant transferee” in relation to that aviation activity where the transferee has not been subject to a further business reorganisation affecting the aviation activity.
Meaning of historical aviation activity level and attributable
34J.—(1) A person's historical aviation activity level is—
(a)
the number of tonne-kilometres of aviation activity performed by the person in 2010;
(b)
in the case of a person who fell within Article 3f(1)(a) of the Directive and made a successful special reserve application, the number of tonne-kilometres of aviation activity performed by the person in 2014; or
(c)
in the case of a person who fell within Article 3f(1)(b) of the Directive and made a successful special reserve application, the sum of—
(i)
the number of tonne-kilometres of aviation activity performed by the person in 2010; and
(ii)
the person's aviation activity ratio multiplied by the difference between the person's 2010 to 2014 growth in Annex 1 activities and the person's threshold figure.
(2) In this article, a person's—
“2010 to 2014 growth in Annex 1 activities” means the difference between the number of tonne-kilometres of Annex 1 activities performed by the person in 2010 and the number of tonne-kilometres of Annex 1 activities performed by the person in 2014;
“2010 to 2014 growth in aviation activity” means—
(a)
if the number of tonne-kilometres of aviation activity performed by the person in 2014 is greater than the number of tonne-kilometres of aviation activity performed by the person in 2010, the difference;
(b)
if the number of tonne-kilometres of aviation activity performed by the person in 2014 is less than or equal to the number of tonne-kilometres of aviation activity performed by the person in 2010, zero;
“aviation activity ratio” means the person's 2010 to 2014 growth in aviation activity divided by the person's 2010 to 2014 growth in Annex 1 activities;
“threshold figure” means the number of tonne-kilometres of Annex 1 activities performed by the person in 2010 multiplied by 1.93877776.
(3) A tonne-kilometre of aviation activity or Annex 1 activities performed by a person in 2014 is not to be counted in a total for the purposes of this article if it would have been excluded by the words following point (b) in Article 3f(1) of the Directive (exclusion where activity a continuation of activity performed by another) from forming the basis of an application for free allocation of allowances under the EU ETS.
(4) A person's historical aviation activity level is “attributable” to a person (“A”) for the purposes of this Chapter if and to the extent that—
(a)
there has been no business reorganisation affecting aviation activity relevant to the historical aviation activity level and A is the person who performed that aviation activity; or
(b)
there has been a business reorganisation affecting aviation activity relevant to the historical aviation activity level and in relation to that aviation activity A is the relevant transferee.

(a)
the application and any related information the regulator holds; and
(b)
a calculation of the applicant's aviation free allocation entitlement for each scheme year in the 2021-2025 allocation period, applying paragraphs (2) to (6).
(2) The number of allowances that make up an applicant's aviation free allocation entitlement for each scheme year in the 2021-2025 allocation period is 0.000642186914222035 multiplied by the applicant's historical aviation activity figure multiplied by the reduction factor for the scheme year.
(3) The applicant's “historical aviation activity figure” is the sum of all persons' historical aviation activity levels that are—
(a)
attributable to the applicant immediately before 1st January 2021; and
(b)
relied on for the purposes of the application.
(4) In determining whether and to what extent a person's historical aviation activity level is attributable to the applicant, it is permissible to have regard to whether the person's historical aviation activity level is relied on for the purposes of any other application under article 34L and, if so, to the information included in that application.
(5) For the purpose of this article, the reduction factor for a scheme year set out in column 1 of table B1 is the value set out in the corresponding entry in column 2.

(4) The UK ETS authority must update the aviation allocation table to take account of any approval of the UK ETS authority under article 34Q (transfers of allocations) or article 34R (errors in aviation allocation table).
(5) To avoid doubt, the UK ETS authority may update the aviation allocation table under paragraph (4) so as to increase or reduce the number of allowances to be allocated to a person for a scheme year after allowances have already been allocated to the person for the scheme year under article 34O. (See article 34T in relation to the return of allowances where the number of allowances to be allocated to a person for a scheme year is reduced after allowances for the scheme year have been allocated.)
(6) The UK ETS authority must notify the registry administrator of the aviation allocation table as soon as reasonably practicable after it is compiled and of an updated aviation allocation table as soon as reasonably practicable after it is updated.
(7) The UK ETS authority must publish the aviation allocation table as soon as reasonably practicable after it is compiled and must publish an updated aviation allocation table as soon as reasonably practicable after it is updated.
(8) Paragraph (7) is subject to article 75C (national security).
Aviation: allocation of allowances for 2021-2025 allocation period
34O.—(1)  The registry administrator must allocate allowances in accordance with this article.
(2) Subject to paragraphs (3) to (8), allowances must be allocated in accordance with the aviation allocation table—
(a)
for the 2021 scheme year, as soon as reasonably practicable after the aviation allocation table is published;
(b)
for any other scheme year, on or before 28th February in that year.
(3) Allowances must not be allocated to a person unless and until the person has an aircraft operator holding account; they must be allocated by transferring them to that account.
(4) The regulator may, by notice to the registry administrator, require the registry administrator to withhold allowances that would otherwise have been allocated to a person for the 2022 scheme year or a subsequent scheme year if, in relation to the year before, the person was not an aircraft operator.
(5) If allowances for a scheme year are withheld from a person in accordance with paragraph (4) but the person becomes an aircraft operator in relation to that scheme year—
(a)
the regulator must as soon as reasonably practicable, by further notice to the registry administrator, withdraw the notice under paragraph (4); and
(b)
the allowances must be allocated as soon as reasonably practicable after the registry administrator receives the further notice.
(6) Where, after allowances for a scheme year have been allocated to a person, an update to the aviation allocation table results in an increase in the number of allowances to be allocated to the person for the scheme year, the increased number of allowances must be allocated as soon as reasonably practicable.
(7) Where a number of allowances (“N”) has been allocated in accordance with this article for a scheme year in relation to which the person to whom they were allocated was not an aircraft operator, the regulator may give notice to the registry administrator requiring the registry administrator to deduct allowances from any allocation to be made to the person under this article until the sum of—
(a)
the allowances so deducted; and
(b)
allowances allocated for that scheme year that have been returned in accordance with a notice given under article 34U or 34V because the person was not an aircraft operator in relation to that scheme year,

the regulator must inform the UK ETS authority; and
(b)
the UK ETS authority must update the aviation allocation table to record that the person has permanently ceased to perform aviation activity.
Transfers of aviation free allocation entitlement
34Q.—(1) This article applies where a person with an aviation free allocation entitlement has been subject to a business reorganisation affecting aviation activity that was relevant to the approval of the UK ETS authority under article 34M.
(2) The relevant transferee in relation to the aviation activity may apply to the regulator for a transfer of some or all the transferor's aviation free allocation entitlement.
(3) An application under paragraph (2) must—
(a)
include evidence of the business reorganisation;
(b)
identify what part of the aviation free allocation entitlement (expressed as a whole number of allowances) should be transferred to the applicant, justified by reference to the business reorganisation;
(c)
include confirmation that each person who is a transferor or transferee in relation to aviation activity affected by the business reorganisation is aware of the application.
(4) Where an application is made in accordance with paragraph (3), the regulator must submit to the UK ETS authority—
(a)
the application and any related information the regulator holds; and
(b)
a calculation as to what part of the entitlement to free allocation (expressed as a whole number of allowances) should be transferred to the applicant, applying paragraphs (5) and (6).
(5) The aviation free allocation entitlement to be transferred is what would have been the transferee's aviation free allocation entitlement under article 34M in respect of aviation activity affected by the business reorganisation had the business reorganisation taken place before 1st January 2021, except that—
(a)
for each complete scheme year before the business reorganisation took place, the aviation free allocation entitlement to be transferred is zero;
(b)
for the scheme year in which the business reorganisation took place, what would have been the transferee's aviation free allocation entitlement is to be calculated as if article 34M(6) did not apply, then adjusted on a pro rata basis according to when the business reorganisation took place, with the result expressed as the nearest integer, taking 0.5 as nearest to the previous integer.
(6) In determining what part of the entitlement to free allocation should be transferred to the applicant, it is permissible to have regard to any application under this article and any representations made by a person who, in relation to aviation activity affected by the business reorganisation, is a transferor or transferee.
(7) The UK ETS authority must—
(a)
approve the transfer of some or all of the transferor's free allocation entitlement to the transferee with effect from a specified date, making any corrections to the calculation referred to in paragraph (4)(b) that the UK ETS authority considers appropriate; and

inform the regulator accordingly.
(8) The regulator must give notice to the applicant, and any person who has made representations for the purposes of paragraph (6), of the outcome of the application.
Errors in aviation allocation table
34R.—(1) This article applies where the regulator considers that, but for a relevant error, the number of allowances set out in the aviation allocation table as a person's aviation free allocation entitlement for a scheme year would be materially greater or materially less.
(2) In this article, “relevant error” means—
(a)
an error in an application under article 34L or 34Q;
(b)
an error of the regulator or the UK ETS authority in the exercise of functions under this Order (including under this article).
(3) The regulator must calculate the number of allowances that, in the regulator's opinion, make up the person's correct aviation free allocation entitlement for the scheme year.
(4) The regulator must send to the UK ETS authority—
(a)
details of the relevant error;
(b)
the calculation referred to in paragraph (3).
(5) If the UK ETS authority considers that but for the relevant error, the number of allowances set out in the aviation allocation table as the person's aviation free allocation entitlement for the scheme year would be materially greater or materially less, the UK ETS authority must—
(a)
approve the person's aviation free allocation entitlement for the scheme year, making any corrections to the calculation referred to in paragraph (3) that the UK ETS authority considers appropriate; and
(b)
inform the regulator accordingly.
(6) The regulator must give notice to the person of—
(a)
the relevant error;

“Article 16a
Cross-sectoral correction factors
1.  This Article applies where, for a scheme year (the “relevant scheme year”) in an allocation period:
(a)
the sum (“PFA”) of the preliminary annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of all installations in the relevant scheme year calculated under Article 16 (including any corrections required under Article 16(11)) is greater than the industry cap (“IC”) for the relevant scheme year; and
(b)
the amount by which PFA exceeds IC is greater than the previous unallocated amount.
2.  The previous unallocated amount is TIC + FS - TFA, where:
(a)
TIC is the sum of the industry cap for each scheme year in the trading period preceding the relevant scheme year;
(b)
FS is 40,984,970 allowances (the flexible share);
(c)
TFA is the sum of the final allocation for each scheme year in the trading period preceding the relevant scheme year.
3.  The final allocation for a scheme year is the sum of—
(a)
the total preliminary annual number of allowances calculated under Article 16 to be allocated in the scheme year in respect of all installations other than electricity generators multiplied by the cross-sectoral correction factor (if any) for the scheme year determined under this Article; and
(b)
the total preliminary annual number of allowances calculated under Article 16 to be allocated in the scheme year in respect of all electricity generators multiplied by the cross-sectoral correction factor (if any) for the scheme year determined under this Article or, if there is no cross-sectoral correction factor for the scheme year, the reduction factor for the scheme year.
4.  The UK ETS authority must determine the cross-sectoral correction factor for the relevant scheme year, that is to say the factor that reduces PFA by such amount that TIC + IC + FS = TFA + the final allocation for the relevant scheme year.
5.  The UK ETS authority must, as soon as reasonably practicable, publish for each allocation period:
(a)
the cross-sectoral correction factors for scheme years in the allocation period determined under paragraph 4; or
(b)
if there is no cross-sectoral correction factor for any scheme year in the allocation period, a statement to that effect.
6.  For the purposes of this Article:
(a)
the industry cap for a scheme year set out in column 1 of table A is the number of allowances set out in the corresponding entry in column 2;
(b)
the reduction factor for a scheme year set out in column 1 of table A is the value set out in the corresponding entry in column 3.

(a)
a deemed application for free allocation in the 2021-2025 allocation period was made in respect of the installation and the installation is included in the hospital and small emitter list for 2021-2025 or the ultra-small emitter list for 2021-2025; or
(b)
an application for free allocation in the 2026-2030 allocation period is made in respect of the installation under Article 4 and the installation is included in the hospital and small emitter list for 2026-2030 or the ultra-small emitter list for 2026-2030.
8.  Accordingly, the matters referred to in paragraph 5 must not, in relation to the 2026-2030 allocation period, be published before the publication of the hospital and small emitter list for 2026-2030 and the ultra-small emitter list for 2026-2030 under the UK ETS Order (see paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 7, and paragraph 3(6) of Schedule 8, to that Order)
Article 16b
Final allocation at installation level for incumbent installations
1.  Where the preliminary annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of an installation has been calculated under Article 16, the regulator must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the publication of the matters referred to in Article 16a(5):
(a)
calculate the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of each installation and each sub-installation of each installation:
(i)
in the case of a deemed application for free allocation in the 2021-2025 allocation period, for each scheme year in the 2021-2025 allocation period;
(ii)
in the case of an application for free allocation in the 2026-2030 allocation period under Article 4, for each scheme year in the 2026-2030 allocation period; and
(b)
send the calculation to the UK ETS authority.
2.  The final annual number of allowances to be allocated for a scheme year in respect of a sub-installation is the preliminary annual number of allowances calculated under Article 16 (including any corrections required under Article 16(11)) multiplied by:
(a)
in the case of sub-installation of an installation other than an electricity generator, the cross-sectoral correction factor for the scheme year (if any) determined under Article 16a;
(b)
in the case of a sub-installation of an electricity generator, the cross-sectoral correction factor for the scheme year determined under Article 16a or, if there is no cross-sectoral correction factor for the scheme year, the reduction factor for the scheme year (see Article 16a(6)).
3.  The final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of an installation for a scheme year is the sum of the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of all sub-installations of the installation.
4.  The UK ETS authority must:
(a)
approve the final annual number allowances, making any corrections to the calculation that the UK ETS authority considers appropriate;
(b)
inform the regulator accordingly.
5.  For the purpose of the calculation referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, the number of allowances for sub-installations and installations must be expressed as the nearest integer, taking 0.5 as nearest to the previous integer.”.

Assessment of applications and final allocation at installation level for new entrants
1.  Where an application for free allocation is made by a new entrant under Article 5, the regulator must send the information set out in paragraph 2 to the UK ETS authority as soon as reasonably practicable.
2.  The information is:
(a)
details of the installation, including details of the greenhouse gas emissions permit in force;
(b)
the information contained in the new entrant data report submitted with the application under Article 5;
(c)
the historical activity levels (if any) determined under Article 17;
(d)
the preliminary annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation and of each sub-installation separately, as calculated under Article 18;
(e)
where the regulator has not, by virtue of Article 5(6)(c), determined historical activity levels or the preliminary annual number of allowances, the regulator's explanation;
(f)
except where point (e) applies, the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of each sub-installation of the installation:
(i)
for the scheme year in the relevant allocation period in which the start of normal operation of the sub-installation occurs; and
(ii)
where the historical activity level of the sub-installation has been determined under Article 17, for each subsequent scheme year in the relevant allocation period;
(g)
except where point (e) applies, the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for each scheme year in the relevant allocation period;
(h)
whether or not a monitoring methodology plan has been approved in relation to the installation under Article 8.
3.  The final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of a sub-installation for a scheme year is the preliminary annual number of allowances calculated under Article 18 multiplied by the reduction factor for the scheme year.
4.  The final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of an installation for a scheme year is the sum of the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of all sub-installations of the installation for the scheme year.
5.  The UK ETS authority must as soon as reasonably practicable:
(a)
assess the application for free allocation and, where relevant, the regulator's explanation under paragraph 2(e); and
(b)
inform the regulator whether or not the application is valid.
6.  Where the application is valid, the UK ETS authority must also:
(a)
approve the final annual number of allowances, making any corrections to the historical activity levels, preliminary annual number of allowances and final annual number of allowances that the UK ETS authority considers appropriate; and
(b)
inform the regulator of the matters referred to in point (a).
7.  But where a monitoring methodology plan has not been approved in relation to the installation at the date on which the information set out in paragraph 2 is sent to the UK ETS authority, paragraph 6 applies only after the regulator informs the UK ETS authority that the monitoring methodology plan submitted to the regulator for approval has been approved and does not apply if the regulator informs the UK ETS authority that the monitoring methodology plan has been rejected.
8.  The regulator must give notice to the operator of the installation of the following:
(a)
whether or not the application is valid;
(b)
if the application is not valid, the reasons why it is not valid.
9.  Where the application is valid, the regulator must also give notice to the operator:
(a)
of the final annual number of allowances approved under paragraph 6; or
(b)
that a final annual number of allowances has not been approved because the monitoring methodology plan submitted to the regulator for approval has been rejected.
10.  For the purpose of the calculations referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, the number of allowances for sub-installations and installations must be expressed as the nearest integer, taking 0.5 as nearest to the previous integer.
11.  For the purposes of this Article, the reduction factor for a scheme year set out in column 1 of table B is the value set out in the corresponding entry in column 2.
Table B

Sch. 2 para. 10 in force at 31.12.2020 on IP completion day, see art. 2(2)(b)EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (the “UK ETS”) was established by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 (the “UK ETS Order”). The UK ETS runs for ten “scheme years” beginning in 2021, divided into two “allocation periods”, the 2021-2025 allocation period and the 2026-2030 allocation period. Operators of certain industrial installations and certain aircraft operators are required to monitor, report on, and surrender “allowances” equivalent to, their greenhouse gas emissions in each scheme year.
This Order amends the UK ETS Order and other legislation, largely to provide for a registry for the UK ETS and for the free allocation of allowances. The legislation amended includes Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 (the “Free Allocation Regulation”) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1842 (the “Activity Level Changes Regulation”). Both Regulations are retained EU law, originally made for the EU Emissions Trading System (“EU ETS”), but adapted for the UK ETS.
For provision for the registry, see new Schedule 5A to the UK ETS Order; for provision for free allocation for installations, see new Part 4A of the UK ETS Order, the Free Allocation Regulation and the Activity Level Changes Regulation; and for provision for free allocation for aircraft operators, see new Part 4A of the UK ETS Order.
Registry
The Order establishes a registry for the UK ETS to record the creation, allocation (whether by free allocation or auction), transfer and surrender of allowances. Operators and aircraft operators are required to have accounts in the registry in order to comply with their obligations under the scheme. Others may apply for trading accounts for the purpose of trading in allowances.
Registry functions are exercised by the “registry administrator”, defined as the Secretary of State, the Environment Agency, the Natural Resources Body for Wales, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Northern Ireland chief inspector: see new article 8A of the UK ETS Order.
Free allocation of allowances
Operators of eligible installations and eligible aircraft operators may apply for the free allocation of allowances. Decisions about free allocation are made by the Secretary of State, the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the Scottish Ministers and the Welsh Ministers, referred to as the “UK ETS authority”. Allowances are allocated to successful applicants in each scheme year in an allocation period in accordance with allocation tables published by the UK ETS authority. The allowances may be traded or surrendered to comply with the scheme obligation.
For installations, the Order provides for free allocation in both allocation periods in respect of (a) “incumbent installations” - installations for which a greenhouse gas emissions permit is issued by a specified cut-off date, who apply for free allocation for all scheme years in an allocation period; and (b) “new entrants” – new installations in respect of which such a permit is issued after the cut-off date, who apply for free allocation for scheme years in an allocation period after operation starts. For the 2021-2025 allocation period, only operators of installations who applied for free allocation under the EU ETS are eligible for free allocation under the UK ETS as “incumbent installations”.
The number of allowances allocated in respect of incumbent installations is subject to an “industry cap” and may be reduced by a cross-sectoral correction factor: see new Article 16a of the Free Allocation Regulation. Allocations in respect of new entrants are reduced by an annual reduction factor over an allocation period: see new Article 18a of that Regulation. Operators of installations are required to report on their “activity level” each year, which may lead to an increase or decrease in the allowances allocated: see the Activity Level Changes Regulation. Allowances allocated in respect of new entrants and increases in allocations in respect of all installations come from a reserve of 30,249,066 allowances known as the “new entrants' reserve” until the reserve is exhausted: see new article 34G of the UK ETS Order.
For aircraft operators, the Order provides for free allocation in the 2021-2025 allocation period only. There is no provision for “new” aircraft operators to apply. Allocations are reduced by an annual reduction factor over the allocation period, but otherwise do not change: see new article 34M of the UK ETS Order. Only an “aircraft operator” as defined in article 6 of the UK ETS Order, that is a person who operates above a specified minimum threshold, is entitled to an allocation of allowances.
Where allowances have been over-allocated, operators and aircraft operators may be required to return them or an equivalent number may be taken directly from registry accounts: see new articles 34S to 34V of the UK ETS Order. The allocation of allowances may be withheld whilst investigation is underway into circumstances which may lead to a change in allocation: see new article 34W of the UK ETS Order. There are also some specific provisions, in article 34O, which take into account that it is not always possible to be certain whether a person will be an aircraft operator in a particular year (and so have an entitlement to free allocation) at the time allowances for that year are due to be allocated. These provide for allowances to be withheld if a person was not an aircraft operator in the previous year and for adjustments in later years where necessary.
A regulatory impact assessment of the effect that the UK ETS will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Industrial Energy Directorate, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0ET and is available alongside the UK ETS Order on www.legislation.gov.uk.

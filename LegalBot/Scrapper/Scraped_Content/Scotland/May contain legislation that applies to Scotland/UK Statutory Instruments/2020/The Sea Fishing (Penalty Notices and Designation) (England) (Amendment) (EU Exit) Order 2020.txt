22nd December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Sea Fishing (Penalty Notices) (England) Order 2011 (S.I. 2011/758) (“the 2011 Order”) in consequence of amendments made by the Fisheries Act 2020 (c. 22).
The 2011 Order creates a scheme for the issuing and payment of penalty notices for certain specified offences relating to sea fishing (“penalty offences”). The Fisheries Act 2020 includes amendments to legislation governing foreign vessel access to British fisheries and the licensing of fishing vessels, both of which are areas where the 2011 Order specifies penalty offences. It is therefore necessary to update the list of penalty offences contained in the 2011 Order to remove references to offence provisions which have been replaced by the Fisheries Act 2020 amendments and include references to relevant replacement provisions.
This Order also amends Schedule 7 to the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (c. 16) to designate the Marine Management Organisation as a “designated body” under section 80 of that Act.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

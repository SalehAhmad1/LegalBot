16th June 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Schedule 1 to the Education (Pupil Information) (England) Regulations 2005 (“Schedule 1”), which requires head teachers of maintained schools to provide an annual report to parents and adult pupils in respect of every registered pupil at the school, in light of changes to pupil attendance and the cancellation of assessments due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Regulation 2(2)(a) amends paragraph 1(d) of Schedule 1 so as to exclude attendance information relating to the school year 2019/20 from the requirement to provide an attendance record in the head teacher’s annual report.
Regulation 2(2)(b) amends paragraph 1(g) of Schedule 1 so as to remove the requirement to provide assessment information in annual reports in relation to assessments taken in the 2019/20 school year.
Regulation 2(3) amends paragraph 2 of that Schedule to remove the requirement to include information in annual reports produced at the end of Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 about assessments taken during those Key Stages where the head teacher’s annual report is prepared in the school year 2019/20.
Regulation 2(4) makes a consequential amendment to the definition of “comparative information” in paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 in light of the fact that no assessments at Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 will have taken place in the school year 2019/20.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

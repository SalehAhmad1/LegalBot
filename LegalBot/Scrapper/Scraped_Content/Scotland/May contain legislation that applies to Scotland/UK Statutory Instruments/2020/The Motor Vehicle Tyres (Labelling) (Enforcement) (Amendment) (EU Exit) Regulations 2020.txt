(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters will form part of domestic law in Great Britain from 11pm on 31 December 2020 by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16). In Northern Ireland, Regulation 1222/2009 will continue to be directly applicable until it is replaced by Regulation (EU) 2020/740 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 2020 on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other parameters, amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 on 1 May 2021 by virtue of section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and articles 5(4) and 13(3) of, and Annex 2 to, the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the agreement between the United Kingdom and the EU under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union which sets out the arrangements for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
Part 2 of these Regulations provides the Secretary of State with powers to enforce obligations under Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 and Regulation (EU) 2020/740 by service of a compliance notice requiring rectification of a breach and by the imposition of civil penalties.
Part 3 of these Regulations amends Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 as it applies in Great Britain from 11pm on 31 December 2020. The amendments are made pursuant to the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(b) and (g) and under paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

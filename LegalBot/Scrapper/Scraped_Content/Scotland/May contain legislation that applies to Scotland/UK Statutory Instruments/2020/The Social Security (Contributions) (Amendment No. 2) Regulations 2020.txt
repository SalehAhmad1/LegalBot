termination awards that exceed the £30,000 which count as employment income under section 403 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (c.1) (“ITEPA 2003”) and
sporting testimonial payments which are treated as taxable earnings under section 226E and section 306B of ITEPA 2003.
Regulation 1 provides for citation, commencement and effect.
Regulation 2 introduces the amendments to the 2001 Regulations.
Regulation 3 inserts new definitions into the 2001 Regulations relating to sporting testimonial payments.
Regulation 4 revokes regulation 40B with savings as it is now replaced by sections 10ZBA of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992.
Regulations 5 and 6 make amendments to regulations 71 and 80 in consequence of regulation 7.
Regulation 7 inserts new regulations 40C and 40D. These new regulations make special provisions for reporting, paying and collecting Class 1A contributions due on termination awards and sporting testimonial payments.

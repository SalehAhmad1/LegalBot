The relevant period for these temporary provisions was first prolonged by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Extension of the Relevant Period) Regulations (S.I. 2020/1031). These Regulations now prolong the expiry of the relevant period for the temporary restrictions on winding up petitions so that it ends on 31st March 2021.

Regulation 2 of these Regulations appoints 6th April 2020 as the day on which sections 1 and 2 of the National Insurance Contributions (Termination Awards and Sporting Testimonials) Act 2019 (c. 23) (“the Act”) come into force. Section 1 of the Act amends section 10 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 (c. 4) (“SSCBA 1992”) and inserts an amendment into section 162(5) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 (c. 5). Section 2 of the Act amends section 10 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 7) (“SSCB(NI)A 1992”) and inserts an amendment into section 142(5) of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8). These amendments require employers to pay a Class 1A contribution in respect of a termination award if and so far as it exceeds the £30,000 threshold set out in section 403 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (c. 1). It also provides that these amendments will not take effect in relation to termination awards which were received on or after 6th April 2020 in respect of employment which was terminated before 6th April 2020 or termination awards which are received in instalments where the first instalment of the termination award was received before 6th April 2020.

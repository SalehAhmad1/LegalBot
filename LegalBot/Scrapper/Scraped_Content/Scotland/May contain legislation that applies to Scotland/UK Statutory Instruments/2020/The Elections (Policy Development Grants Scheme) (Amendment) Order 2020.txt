(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Policy Development Grants Scheme 2006 (“the Scheme”) as set out in the Schedule to the Elections (Policy Development Grants Scheme) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/602).
Under section 12 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (c. 41) the Electoral Commission is required to keep under review the terms of the Scheme and to make recommendations to the Secretary of State for any variations to the Scheme which they consider appropriate. The changes made by this Order give effect to those recommendations. The list of parties eligible for grants is amended to include the Social Democratic and Labour Party following the general election on 12th December 2019. The formula for determining a party’s weighted vote share, which enables the Electoral Commission to calculate the amount to be allocated to each party in accordance with paragraph 5 of the Scheme, is amended so that it no longer takes into account European Parliamentary elections.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in airspace in the vicinity of Cambridgeshire, 
Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk by reason of the intended holding there of rehearsals by a large 
formation of aircraft practicing for the VE Day 75 celebrations. As timings for these rehearsals are 
critical and the formation may not be able to take effective avoiding action, the Civil Aviation 
Authority and the Department for Transport agree that it is in the public interest for flying to be 
 
3
restricted in the vicinity of the relevant areas to avoid the risk that transient aircraft may disrupt 
the formation.  
In relation to regulation 3, the term ‘aircraft’ includes aircraft as classified by Part 1 of Schedule 4 
to the Air Navigation Order 2016. It also includes, by virtue of article 23 of that Order, any small 
balloon, any kite weighing not more than two kilograms, any small unmanned aircraft and any 
parachute including a parascending parachute. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3 are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC), which for the 
purpose of these Regulations is one hour behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(4)(b), the HQ AIR VE75 Project Officer 
may be contacted on telephone number 07870 390860. 
Full details of the Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Notice To Airmen (NOTAM).

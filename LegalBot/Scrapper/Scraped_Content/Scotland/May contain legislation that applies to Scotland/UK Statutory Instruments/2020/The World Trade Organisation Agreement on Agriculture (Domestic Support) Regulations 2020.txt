16th December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Agriculture Act 2020, to ensure that the United Kingdom does not breach its obligations under the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Agriculture (“AoA”) in relation to domestic support. They specify the amounts of amber box domestic support (which may have trade distorting effects and is therefore limited under the AoA) which may be given in each country in the United Kingdom (regulation 4) and prohibit any country in the United Kingdom from giving more (regulation 7). They also set out the procedure for each country to give notice of new schemes or amendments to existing schemes (regulation 5), how the classification of such schemes under the AoA is to be determined (regulation 6), and make provision for annual notifications to be given, identifying the domestic support given in the United Kingdom (regulation 8), and permit the Secretary of State to request further information where this is needed to enable the United Kingdom to satisfy its obligations under the AoA (regulation 9).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

SCHEDULE 1
Form of logo
  Regulation 8
SCHEDULE 2
Form of words in respect of wood sold in volumes of two cubic metres or more
This wood is not suitable for burning until it has been dried. You should not burn wood until it has a moisture content of 20% or less.
Wet wood contains moisture which creates smoke and harmful particulates when burnt. As well as being harmful to your health and the environment, this can damage your stove and chimney and is an inefficient way to heat your home. Dry it in a sunny, well-aired space for at least two years, keeping rain off in the winter.
Radial cracks and bark that comes off easily suggests wood that is ready for burning. Test the wood when you think it is ready for burning, ideally with a moisture meter. First calibrate the meter and then measure a freshly split surface to get the best reading.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under section 87 of the Environment Act 1995 (c. 25). They make provision restricting the sale of certain solid fuels, and provide for the enforcement of breaches of these Regulations by a local authority.
Part 1 of the Regulations provides that they come into force, for the purpose of appointing a certification body under either regulation 5 or 11, on the day after they are made, and for all other purposes on 1st May 2021.
Part 2 of the Regulations relates to the supply of wood in amounts of under two cubic metres. It is an offence to supply such wood unless it has been certified, under regulation 5 of that Part, and unless it is accompanied by the information specified in regulation 4. The penalty for an offence committed under Part 2 is a fine. However, under regulation 6, nothing in Part 2 of the Regulations applies to a small forester (as defined in regulation 6(2)) for a year following the coming into force of the offences in the Regulations.
Part 3 of the Regulations relates to the supply of wood in amounts of two cubic metres or more. It is an offence punishable by a fine to supply such an amount of wood without the accompanying words specified in Schedule 2.
Part 4 of the Regulations makes provision in respect of the supply of manufactured solid fuels. A person must not supply a manufactured solid fuel that is not an authorised fuel within the meaning of that Part, or supply a manufactured solid that is not on the list maintained by the Secretary of State under regulation 12. Regulation 11 provides for the appointment by the Secretary of State of an approved manufactured solid fuel certification body. It also deems a fuel that is on the list under Part 3 of the Clean Air Act 1993 (c. 11) immediately before the coming into force of these Regulations to be an authorised fuel (but only for as long as that fuel remains on the list).
Part 5 makes provision relating to the supply of bituminous coal. It is an offence to supply pre-bagged and loose bituminous coal. However, an Approved Coal Merchant will not commit the offence of selling loose bituminous coal to a consumer where the coal is sold directly to a consumer during the two-year period ending with 30th April 2023.
Part 6 makes provision for the enforcement of the Regulations by a local authority.
Part 7 provides for review of the operation of the Regulations for the purpose of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (c. 26).
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF, and is published with an Explanatory Memorandum alongside these Regulations on https://legislation.gov.uk.

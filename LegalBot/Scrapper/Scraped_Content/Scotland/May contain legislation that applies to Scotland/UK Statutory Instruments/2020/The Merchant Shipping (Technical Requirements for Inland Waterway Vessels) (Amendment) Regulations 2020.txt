(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Merchant Shipping (Technical Requirements for Inland Waterway Vessels) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1075) (“the 2010 Regulations”) to reflect amendments made to Annex II to Directive (EU) 2016/1629 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14th September 2016 laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels, amending Directive 2009/100/EC and repealing Directive 2006/87/EC (“the Directive”) by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1668 of 26 June 2019 (OJ No L 256 07.10.2019, p. 1).
These Regulations also give effect, in regulation 6, to the Corrigendum of 5th July 2019 to Directive (EU) 2016/1629 which corrected the date documents issued before which by the competent authorities of the Member States under the Directive would remain valid until they expire from 6th October 2016 to 6th October 2018.
The Commission Delegated Regulation updates the ES-TRIN standard referred to in Annex II to the Directive to refer to ES-TRIN 2019/1.
Accordingly, it has been necessary to update references to ES-TRIN standard 2017/1 in the 2010 Regulations to ES-TRIN standard 2019/1.
Regulation 3 amends the definition of “technical requirements of Annex II” in regulation 2 (interpretation) of the 2010 Regulations to refer to the version of Annex II as amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1668 of 26 June 2019. It also updates the reference to “Merchant Shipping Notice MSN 1880(M)” to “Merchant Shipping Notice MSN 1880(M) Amendment 1” which contains the updated ES-TRIN standard.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 6 (obligation to carry a certificate) of the 2010 Regulations to refer to the updated version of Merchant Shipping Notice MSN 1879(M).
Regulation 5 amends regulation 9 (Union inland navigation certificates and supplementary Union inland navigation certificates) of the 2010 Regulations to update references to the ES-TRIN standard and Merchant Shipping Notice MSN 1880(M).
Regulation 6 amends regulation 15 (transitional provision) by substituting “2018” for “2016”.

By virtue of sections 41(2A) and 52(2A) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”), non-domestic rating lists for England are to be compiled on 1st April 2017 and every fifth year afterwards. Paragraph 2(3)(b) of Schedule 6 to the 1988 Act provides the Secretary of State with the power to specify the day by reference to which properties are to be valued for the purposes of compiling new lists.
Article 2 of this Order specifies 1st April 2021 as that day for the purposes of the next local and central non-domestic rating lists to be compiled once this Order has come into force.
Article 3 revokes the Rating Lists (Valuation Date) (England) Order 2018 (“the 2018 Order”) which had specified 1st April 2019 as the day for the purposes of the next local and central non-domestic rating lists to be compiled after the 2018 Order came into force.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument because it amends an existing local tax regime. Publication of a full impact assessment is not necessary for such legislation.

S.I. 2007/283, amended by S.I. 2007/2131.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends with modifications the Lebanon (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/612) (“the Lebanon Regulations”) as amended from time to time to all British overseas territories except Bermuda and Gibraltar (which implement sanctions under their own legislative arrangements).
Section 63(3)(c) of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) (“the Sanctions Act”) provides that Her Majesty may by Order in Council provide for any provision of Part 1 of that Act, or any regulations under Part 1 of the Act, to extend with or without modifications to any of the British overseas territories. Section 63(4) provides that this includes the power to extend any regulations as amended from time to time.
The Lebanon Regulations were made under Part 1 of the Sanctions Act to establish a sanctions regime in relation to Lebanon for the purposes of compliance with the United Kingdom’s international obligations under UN Security Resolution 1701 (2006). Following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, the Lebanon Regulations also replace the European Union sanctions regime in respect of Lebanon, implemented via an EU Council Decision and Regulation.
The Lebanon Regulations, as modified and extended to the British overseas territories listed in Schedule 1 by this Order (“the modified Regulations”) impose trade restrictions on military goods and technology in relation to Lebanon. Related controls are also imposed on the provision of technical assistance, financial services and funds, and brokering services.
The modified Regulations provide for certain exceptions to this sanctions regime (for example to allow acts done for the purpose of national security or the prevention of serious crime). The Governor of a British overseas territory to which the modified Regulations extend may, with the consent of the Secretary of State, issue a licence in respect of activities that would otherwise be prohibited under the modified Regulations.
This Order also extends to the territories for the purposes of the modified Regulations specific provisions of Part 1 of the Sanctions Act, namely provisions relating to protection for acts done for purposes of compliance, Crown application and saving for prerogative powers.
An Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this instrument: the territorial extent of the instrument is the British overseas territories listed in Schedule 1 and no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sectors in the United Kingdom.

5th May 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Victims’ Payments Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/103).
The amendments made by paragraphs (2), (3), (6) and (7) of regulation 2 correct defects in those Regulations.
The Victims’ Payment Regulations 2020 make provision allowing certain determinations to be appealed (regulation 34) or reviewed (regulation 43). The amendment made by paragraph (4) of regulation 2 makes clearer that, where the result of a review is the making of a new determination or the varying of the determination, an appeal may be brought in respect of that new determination or the determination as varied. The amendment made by paragraph (5) is consequential to that amendment.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

29th September 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order increases the total amount that the United Kingdom can loan to the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) from 18,657.38 million to 22,912.32 million special drawing rights (“SDRs”).
The limit was previously raised from 12,470 million to 18,657.38 million SDRs by the International Monetary Fund (Limit on Lending) Order 2010, which is revoked by this Order.
An SDR is the unit of account used by the IMF. Its value is calculated daily as a weighted average of the US dollar, euro, yen, Chinese renminbi and pound sterling. Its value can be found on the IMF’s website (www.imf.org).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this Order as no impact on the costs of business or the voluntary sector is foreseen.

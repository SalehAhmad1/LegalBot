(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules temporarily modify the Secure Training Centre Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998/472) (“the STC Rules”). The modifications are in response to the effect of the coronavirus pandemic in Secure Training Centres and apply during a transmission control period.
Rule 1 provides that the modifications made by these Rules cease to have effect on 25th March 2022.
Rule 2(2) inserts new definitions into the STC Rules including defining a “transmission control period”.
Rule 2(3) modifies rule 11 of the STC Rules to insert a rule 11(1A) which allows the Secretary of State to suspend a trainee’s statutory entitlement to visitors where necessary as a result of effects arising from the coronavirus.
Rules 2(4) and (5) modify rules 27 and 28 of the STC Rules to provide greater flexibility to comply with the requirements of these rules during a transmission control period.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

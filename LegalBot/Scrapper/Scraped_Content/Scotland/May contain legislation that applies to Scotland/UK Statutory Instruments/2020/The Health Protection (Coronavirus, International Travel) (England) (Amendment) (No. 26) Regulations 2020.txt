Form A: negative test result
Your coronavirus test result is negative. You did not have the virus when the test was done. If you are self-isolating as an international arrival you may stop self-isolating.
You should self-isolate if:
you get symptoms of coronavirus (you should get an NHS coronavirus test and self-isolate until you get the results)
you are going into hospital (self-isolating until the date you go in)
someone you live with tests positive
you have been traced as a contact of someone who tested positive
For advice on when you might need to self-isolate and what to do, go to www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19 and read ‘Self-isolation and treating symptoms’.
It is a legal requirement to self-isolate when you arrive in the UK from a non-exempt country, territory or region. If you are contacted by the enforcement authorities or the police after you have received this negative result please show them this notification.
Form B: positive test result
Your coronavirus test result is positive. You had the virus when the test was done.
If you have not had symptoms of coronavirus, you must self-isolate for 10 days from your test date. If you have symptoms of coronavirus, you must self-isolate for 10 days from the day your symptoms started, if earlier than when you took your test.
People you live with or are travelling with should also self-isolate for [F410] days from the day you took the test.
You may be contacted for contact tracing and to check that you, and those who you live or are travelling with, are self-isolating.
You must not travel, including to leave the UK, during self-isolation.
Contact 111 if you need medical help. In an emergency dial 999.
Form C: unclear test result
Your coronavirus test result is unclear. It is not possible to say if you had the virus when the test was done.
You must, by law, continue self-isolating for the remainder of your self-isolation period as an international arrival travelling to the UK from a non-exempt country, territory or region. You may be contacted to check that you are self-isolating.
If you want to shorten your self-isolation period you will need to take another test for international arrivals. For more information, go to https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel.

Department for TransportEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (“the International Travel Regulations”).
They set out the circumstances in which a person who would otherwise be required by the International Travel Regulations to self-isolate for up to 14 days after their arrival in England may stop self-isolating if they test negative for SARS-CoV-2, having taken a test other than one administered by the NHS (“test to release”).
The Regulations also make a consequential amendment to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health Information for Passengers Travelling to England) Regulations 2020, to require that information about test to release is provided to passengers arriving in England.

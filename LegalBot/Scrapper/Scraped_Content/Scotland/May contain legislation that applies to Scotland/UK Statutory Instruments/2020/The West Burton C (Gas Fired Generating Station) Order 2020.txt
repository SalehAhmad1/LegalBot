(6) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal; or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision of the discharging authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not),
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to the appointed person in the first instance.
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the time limits prescribed, or set by the appointed person, under this paragraph.
(8) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have been made within those time limits, if it appears to the appointed person that there is sufficient material to enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case.
(9) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is final and binding on the parties and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(10) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is deemed to be an approval for the purpose of the relevant requirement in Schedule 2 (requirements) as if it had been given by the discharging authority. The discharging authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) may not be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.

(12) On application by the discharging authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to the Planning Practice Guidance or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

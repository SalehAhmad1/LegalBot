(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) (“the principal Regulations”).
Regulation 2 of these Regulations adds a number of countries and territories to the list of exempt countries and territories in Schedule A1 to the principal Regulations. Passengers are not required to self-isolate on arrival in England if, during the 14 days preceding their arrival, they have only been in or transited through exempt countries or territories. Passengers who have been in or transited through a non-exempt country or territory must self-isolate until 14 days have elapsed since the day after they last left a non-exempt country or territory.
Regulation 3 ensures that these amendments apply only in relation to passengers arriving in England on or after 28th July 2020.

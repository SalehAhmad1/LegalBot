26th February 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Controlled Drugs (Supervision of Management and Use) Regulations 2013 (the 2013 Regulations). The 2013 Regulations contain a sunset clause to provide that they expire on 31st March 2020. Regulation 3 removes this clause. Regulation 4 inserts new regulation 1A which introduces a requirement on the Secretary of State to carry out a statutory review of the 2013 Regulations and to publish a report of that review by 30th March 2025, and to then publish subsequent reports every 5 years. Regulations 5, 6 and 7 make miscellaneous amendments to regulations 2, 6 and 13 of the 2013 Regulations, to update definitions and references to bodies. In particular they reflect internal reorganisation of the National Health Service Business Services Authority, and the change of one of the responsible bodies in Scotland who are engaged in information activities that involve the management or use of controlled drugs, from the Information Services Division of the Common Services Agency to Public Health Scotland, who will also hold the Prescribing Information Systems for Scotland.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

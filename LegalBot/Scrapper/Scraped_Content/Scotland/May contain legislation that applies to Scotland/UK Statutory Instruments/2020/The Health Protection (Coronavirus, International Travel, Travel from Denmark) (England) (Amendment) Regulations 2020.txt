(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Travel from Denmark) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1239) to—
(a)
remove Greece (other than specified islands) and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus from the list of exempt countries and territories, in Schedule A1, from which passengers arriving in England are not required to self-isolate;
(b)
add Bahrain, Cambodia, Chile, Iceland, Laos, Qatar, Turks and Caicos Islands and United Arab Emirates to that list;
(c)
revise the definition of “domestic elite sportsperson”, which is relevant to an exemption from the requirement to self-isolate;
(d)
make provision in relation to Denmark (described below).
Passengers are not required to self-isolate on arrival in England if, during the 14 days preceding their arrival, they have only been in or transited through exempt countries or territories, or exempt parts of countries or territories. Passengers who have been in or transited through a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory, must self-isolate until 14 days have elapsed since the day after they last left a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory. The changes to Schedule A1 will not affect passengers who arrive in England before 4.00 a.m. on 14th November 2020.
In response to an outbreak of a mink-variant of COVID-19—
(a)
Denmark was removed from the list of exempt countries and territories (S.I. 2020/1227);
(b)
exemptions from the requirement to self-isolate for passengers who had been in or transited through Denmark during the 14 days preceding their arrival in England were removed, and the self-isolation requirement was extended to persons residing with such passengers (S.I. 2020/1238);
(c)
a prohibition on the arrival of certain aircraft and vessels departing from Denmark was introduced (S.I. 2020/1239).
Regulation 2(2) introduces a limited exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for persons taking part in, or directly supporting, two specified international sporting events. Regulation 3 allows certain aircraft departing from Denmark to land in England, including in relation to the specified international sporting events.

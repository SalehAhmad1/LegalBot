Sch. 2 para. 6 in force at 31.12.2020 by S.I. 2020/1514, reg. 16(2)EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) to give effect to the United Kingdom's international obligations resulting from various United Nations Security Council Resolutions imposing a sanctions regime in view of the situation in Afghanistan, including UN Security Council Resolution 2255 (2017) adopted by the Security Council on 21 December 2015 (and previously UN Security Council Resolution 1988 (2011)). Following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, these Regulations will replace the corresponding EU sanctions regime, which is currently implemented by an EU Council Decision and Regulation.
The Regulations provide that those persons designated by the UN as associated with the Taliban in constituting a threat to the peace, stability and security of Afghanistan are designated for the purposes of these Regulations. Persons designated by the UN are subject to financial sanctions, which include having their funds and/or economic resources frozen. Those persons are also subject to trade restrictions on military goods and military technology and associated services. They are also “excluded persons” under section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971, meaning generally that they must be refused leave to enter the United Kingdom and leave to remain in the United Kingdom, and any leave that has been granted is invalid. The Regulations provide for certain exceptions to this sanctions regime, in particular in relation to financial sanctions (for example to allow for frozen accounts to be credited with interest or other earnings) and also acts done for the purpose of national security or the prevention of serious crime. The Regulations also confer powers on the Treasury to issue licences in respect of activities that would otherwise be prohibited under the financial sanctions. Schedule 2 to these Regulations sets out the purposes pursuant to which the Treasury may issue such licences.
The Regulations make it a criminal offence to contravene, or circumvent, any of the prohibitions in these Regulations and prescribe the mode of trial and penalties that apply to such offences. The Regulations also confer powers on specified maritime enforcement officers to stop and search ships in international and foreign waters for the purpose of enforcing specified trade sanctions and to seize goods found on board ships which are being, or have been, dealt with in contravention, or deemed contravention, of those prohibitions. The Regulations prescribe powers for the provision and sharing of information to enable the effective implementation and enforcement of the sanctions regime.
Council Regulation (EU) No 753/2011 of 1 August 2011 concerning restrictive measures directed against certain individuals, groups, undertakings and entities in view of the situation in Afghanistan is revoked by these Regulations. The Export Control (Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions) Regulations 2011 and the Afghanistan (Asset-Freezing) Regulations 2011 are also revoked. An amendment is also made by these Regulations to the Schedule to the United Nations and European Union Financial Sanctions (Linking) Regulations 2017.
An Impact Assessment has not been produced for these Regulations, as they are intended to ensure existing sanctions remain in place following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. These Regulations are intended to deliver substantially the same policy effects as the existing European Union sanctions. An Impact Assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and can be found at: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653271/Sanctions_and_Anti-Money_Laundering_Bill_Impact_Assessment_18102017.pdf.

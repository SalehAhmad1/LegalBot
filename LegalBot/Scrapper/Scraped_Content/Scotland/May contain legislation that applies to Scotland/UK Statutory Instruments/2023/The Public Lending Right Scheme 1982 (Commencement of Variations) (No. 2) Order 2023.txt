(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into force, on 31st October 2023, variations of the Public Lending Right Scheme 1982 (“the Scheme”) made by the Secretary of State under the Public Lending Right Act 1979 (c. 10) (the “1979 Act”). The variations are set out in the Appendix to the Order.
The 1979 Act and the Scheme confer a right (known as the public lending right) for authors to receive payments out of a central fund, based on the number of times their books are lent out by public libraries in the United Kingdom. The Scheme is administered by the Board of the British Library.
The variations brought into force by this Order amend the requirements which apply to an application for registration of a book under the Scheme following the death of the author (a “posthumously eligible book”). They also amend requirements relating to the collection of data to determine the number of times a book has been lent out.
The variations set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Appendix amend articles 14A and 17B of the Scheme. The changes allow an application for registration of a posthumously eligible book to be made, in certain circumstances, by the person entitled to the public lending right interest in respect of the book, rather than by the personal representatives of the deceased author.
The variations set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the Appendix amend articles 37, 38 and 42 of the Scheme. The changes enable the British Library, when estimating the number of times a book has been lent out in a particular year, to use data obtained from an increased sample of libraries, or to use comprehensive book loans data collected from all public libraries in the United Kingdom.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

These Regulations make amendments to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Concession Contracts Regulations 2016 and the Utilities Contracts Regulations 2016 as a consequence of the Republic of North Macedonia acceding to the Agreement on Government Procurement (“the GPA”) by the deposit of their instrument of accession on 30th September 2023. The GPA enters into force for the Republic of North Macedonia on 30th October 2023, being the 30th day following deposit of its instrument of accession.
The amendments made by these Regulations update the effective date of the GPA to take account of the Republic of North Macedonia’s accession and also adds the Republic of North Macedonia to the list of GPA parties in the relevant Schedules to the three sets of Regulations being amended.
Transitional provisions are not required as regulation 90A of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, regulation 51A of the Concession Contracts Regulations 2016 and regulation 105A of the Utilities Contracts Regulations 2016 sets out the relevant time the duty to comply with these amendments, as they form part of the Regulations being amended, takes effect in respect of economic operators from the Republic of North Macedonia, as a GPA party.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

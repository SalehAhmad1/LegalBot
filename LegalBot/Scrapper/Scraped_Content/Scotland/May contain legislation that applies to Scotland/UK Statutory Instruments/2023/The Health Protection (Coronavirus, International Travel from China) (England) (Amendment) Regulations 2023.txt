(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel from China) (England) Regulations 2023 to correct an error in regulation 2 of those regulations. The effect of the error would be to limit the application of Part 2 of those Regulations to indirect arrivals from China whose journey involved no more than one stop, which is not in line with the policy intention.

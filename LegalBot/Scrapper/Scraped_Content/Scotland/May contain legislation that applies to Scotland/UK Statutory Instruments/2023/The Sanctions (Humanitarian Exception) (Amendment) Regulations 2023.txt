(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Sanctions (Humanitarian Exception) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (“the Regulations”) are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
The Regulations amend a number of sanctions regulations which have been made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act, namely:

In implementation of the humanitarian exception established for UN sanctions regimes by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2664 (2022) adopted by the Security Council on 9th December 2002, the Regulations insert a humanitarian exception to the provisions implementing the asset-freeze in the listed sanctions regulations (and in the case of the Somalia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 and Haiti (Sanctions) Regulations 2022, replace the existing humanitarian exception). The exception provides that the prohibitions implementing the asset-freeze in the sanctions regimes mentioned above shall not apply in relation to activities carried out by a number of actors including the United Nations, its specialised agencies, or by international and non-governmental organisations supporting UN humanitarian work which are necessary to ensure the timely delivery of humanitarian assistance or to support other activities that support basic human needs

28th September 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make minor amendments to Regulation (EU) 2019/1241 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the conservation of fisheries resources and the protection of marine ecosystems through technical measures (EUR 2019/1241).
Regulation 2 increases the mesh size requirement for vessels fishing for squid in “the English Zone” (which is defined in that regulation). The relevant provisions previously specified a minimum mesh size requirement of 40mm for directed fishing for squid in the North Sea and in North Western Waters but these Regulations increase that minimum mesh size to 80mm for directed fishing for squid using towed gear in the English zone.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

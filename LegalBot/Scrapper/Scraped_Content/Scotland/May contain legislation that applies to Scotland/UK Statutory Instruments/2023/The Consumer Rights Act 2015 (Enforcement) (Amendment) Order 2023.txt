(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends paragraph 11 of Schedule 5 to the Consumer Rights Act 2015.
Paragraph 11 comprises a table which gives a list of domestic enforcers and corresponding legislation which, in respect of the relevant domestic enforcer, is “the enforcer’s legislation”.
Article 2 inserts a new entry into the table so that, for a local weights and measures authority in Great Britain or a district council in Northern Ireland, regulation 6(1) of the Tobacco Products (Traceability and Security Features) Regulations 2019 is enforcer’s legislation. This allows those bodies to exercise powers provided by Schedule 5 to the Consumer Rights Act 2015 when undertaking functions under those Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

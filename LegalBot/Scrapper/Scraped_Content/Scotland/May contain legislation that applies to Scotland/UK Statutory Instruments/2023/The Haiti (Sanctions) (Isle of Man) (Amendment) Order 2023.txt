(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Haiti (Sanctions) (Isle of Man) Order 2022 (S.I. 2022/1340) in consequence of amendments made to the Haiti (Sanctions) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1281) by the Haiti (Sanctions) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1320). Those amendments are made further to the changes made to the UN arms embargo by paragraph 14 of resolution 2699 (2023) adopted by the Security Council on 2nd October 2023, and by paragraph 6 of resolution 2700 (2023) adopted by the Security Council on 19th October 2023.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument because the territorial extent of the instrument and the modified Regulations is the Isle of Man; no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sector in the United Kingdom.

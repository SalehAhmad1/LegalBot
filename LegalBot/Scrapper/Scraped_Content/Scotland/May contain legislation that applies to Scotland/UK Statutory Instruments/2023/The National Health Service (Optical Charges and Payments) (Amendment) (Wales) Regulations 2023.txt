(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Optical Charges and Payments) Regulations 1997 (“the Optical Regulations”) which provide for payments to be made by means of a voucher system in respect of costs incurred by certain categories of persons in connection with sight tests and the supply, replacement and repair of optical appliances.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 1(2) of the Optical Regulations to update the reference in the definition of “small glasses” to the relevant British Standards document, to amend the definition of “face value” to refer to voucher number codes, rather than letter codes, to amend the definition of “NHS sight test fee”, and to insert a definition of “prisoner”. Regulation 2 also amends regulation 1(2) and (3) of the Optical Regulations to replace references to “bifocal lenses” with “multifocal lenses”, which include both bifocal and varifocal lenses.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 8 of the Optical Regulations to make prisoners on leave eligible for a voucher for the supply of an optical appliance.
Regulations 4, 5, 7 and 8 make amendments to the Optical Regulations to reflect the change from voucher letter codes to voucher number codes in Schedule 1 to those Regulations.
Regulation 6 amends regulation 15 of the Optical Regulations. Firstly, to provide that prisoners on leave are eligible for a voucher for repair and replacement of an optical appliance in specified circumstances. Secondly, to provide that certain categories of person are eligible for a voucher for repair and replacement regardless of whether their optical appliance has been lost or damaged as a consequence of illness.
Regulation 9 and the Schedules amend Schedules 1, 2 and 3 to the Optical Regulations to change the value of vouchers issued towards the cost of the supply, replacement and repair of optical appliances and to provide for an uplift to the value of vouchers issued to eligible people under 19 years old in certain circumstances.
Regulation 10 makes transitional provision in relation to vouchers issued or completed but not used or accepted before 20 October 2023.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

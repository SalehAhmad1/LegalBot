This Order amends the Education (Designated Institutions in Further Education) Order 1993 (S.I. 1993/435) (“the 1993 Order”) by removing the International Co-operative College from the scope of the Order as a designated institution for the purposes of section 28 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 (c. 13) (“the Act”).
This Order also updates the wording of article 2 of the 1993 Order to reflect the amendments made to section 28(1) of the Act, by section 143(1)(a) of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 (c. 21). It removes article 4 and Schedule 2 from the 1993 Order because the corresponding enabling powers in sections 32 and 33 of the Act were repealed by paragraphs 4(1) and (3) of Schedule 15 to the Deregulation Act 2015 (c. 20).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Gas Safety (Management) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/551) (“the 1996 Regulations”). The 1996 Regulations provide for the preparation and acceptance of safety cases in respect of the conveyance of gas in a network and impose requirements in respect of gas escapes and the composition and pressure of gas. With one exception, these Regulations come into force on 6th April 2023.
These Regulations update the requirements set out in Schedule 3 to the 1996 Regulations as to the characteristics and composition of gas which is conveyed in a network. The updates include a revision to the range within which the Wobbe Number of gas must fall. The revision to the Wobbe Number range comes into force on 6th April 2025.
These Regulations also amend the 1996 Regulations:
(a)
to bring pipes used to convey gas from biomethane production facilities and LNG facilities within the definition of “network” for the purposes of those Regulations;
(b)
to require there to be a sole emergency reporting service provider for each network and set out the functions of that provider. An “emergency reporting service provider” is a person who has prepared a specific safety case that is accepted by the Health and Safety Executive;
(c)
to make clear that operators of LNG facilities must co-operate with a person conveying gas in a network, a national emergency co-ordinator and an emergency reporting service provider;
(d)
to make a number of minor drafting and consequential amendments and transitional provisions;
(e)
to require the Secretary of State to keep the provisions of the 1996 Regulations as amended by these Regulations under review.
These Regulations also amend the Health and Safety and Nuclear (Fees) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1378) so a fee is payable by an emergency reporting service provider, or a person applying to be such a provider, to the Health and Safety Executive in respect of the exercise of its functions.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is published alongside the instrument on legislation.gov.uk. Copies of the impact assessment are also available from the Energy Policy Team, HSE, Engagement and Policy Division, 2.2 Redgrave Court, Bootle, L20 7HS.

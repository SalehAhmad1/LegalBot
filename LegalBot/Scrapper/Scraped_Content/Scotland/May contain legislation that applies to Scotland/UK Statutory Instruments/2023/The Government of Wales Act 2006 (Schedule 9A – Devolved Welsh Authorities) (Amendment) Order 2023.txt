(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends Schedule 9A (Devolved Welsh Authorities) to the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32) (“the 2006 Act”) and comes into force on 7 November 2023.
Article 2 amends Schedule 9A to the 2006 Act in consequence of the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 (anaw 2) (“the Act”). The Act reforms the law on education and training for children and young people with additional learning needs. Section 91 of the Act continues the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales and renames it the Education Tribunal for Wales.

This Order varies an entry in that list by removing “The Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales or Tribiwnlys Anghenion Addysgol Arbennig Cymru” and replacing it with “The Education Tribunal for Wales or Tribiwnlys Addysg Cymru” in consequence of the change of name made by section 91 of the Act.

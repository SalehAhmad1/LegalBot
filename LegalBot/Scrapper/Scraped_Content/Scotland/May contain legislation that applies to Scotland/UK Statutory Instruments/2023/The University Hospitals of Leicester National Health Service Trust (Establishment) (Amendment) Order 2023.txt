Article 3 sets out the functions of the trust as being to provide goods and services for the purposes of the health service.
Article 4 updates a legislative reference (but otherwise maintains the requirement that one of the trust’s non-executive directors is appointed from the University of Leicester).
Article 5 omits the specification of the trust’s “operational date” as it is of no on-going relevance.
Article 6 revokes articles 7 and 8 of the Establishment Order as they are of no on-going relevance.

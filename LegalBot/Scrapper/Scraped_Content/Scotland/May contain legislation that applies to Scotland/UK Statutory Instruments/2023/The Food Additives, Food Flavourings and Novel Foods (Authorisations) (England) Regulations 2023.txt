SCHEDULE 2
Amendment of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No. 231/2012
“E 960c REBAUDIOSIDE M PRODUCED VIA ENZYME MODIFICATION OF STEVIOL GLYCOSIDES FROM STEVIA
Synonyms
Definition
Rebaudioside M is a steviol glycoside composed predominantly of rebaudioside M with minor amounts of other steviol glycosides such as rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside I, and stevioside.
Rebaudioside M is obtained via enzymatic bioconversion of puriﬁed steviol glycoside leaf extracts (95% steviol glycosides) of the Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni plant using UDP-glucosyltransferase and sucrose synthase enzymes produced by the genetically modified yeasts K. phaffi (formerly known as Pichia pastoris) UGT-a and K. phaffi UGT-b that facilitate the transfer of glucose from sucrose and UDP-glucose to steviol glycosides via glycosidic bonds.
After removal of the enzymes by solid-liquid separation and heat treatment, the purification involves concentration of the rebaudioside M by resin adsorption, followed by recrystallisation of rebaudioside M resulting in a final product containing not less than 95 % of rebaudioside M. Viable cells or the DNA of the yeasts K. phafﬁi UGT-a or K. phafﬁi UGT-b must not be detected in the food additive.
Chemical name Rebaudioside M: 13-[(2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy]kaur-16-en-18-oic acid, 2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl ester

“UV-treated baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
Description/Definition
Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is treated with ultraviolet light to induce the conversion of ergosterol to vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). Vitamin D2 content in the yeast concentrate varies between 800,000 – 3,500,000 IU vitamin D/100 g (200-875 μg/g).
The yeast is inactivated for use in infant formula, follow-on formula, processed cereal-based food and food for special medical purposes as defined in Regulation (EU) No. 609/2013. The yeast can be active or inactive for use in other foods.
The yeast concentrate is blended with regular baker’s yeast in order not to exceed the maximum level in the pre-packed fresh or dry yeast for home baking.
Tan-coloured, free-flowing granules.

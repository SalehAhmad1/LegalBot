The Hydrogen Production Revenue Support (Directions, Eligibility and Counterparty) Regulations 2023
Made
19th December 2023
Coming into force
20th December 2023
Before making these Regulations, the Secretary of State has in accordance with section 85 of the Energy Act 2023(1) consulted the persons listed in section 85(2).
In accordance with sections 57(9) and 331(3) of that Act, a draft of these Regulations has been approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.
Accordingly, the Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 57, 58(2), 58(3), 66(2), 66(3), 66(4), 66(5) and 83(1) of that Act, makes the following Regulations—
(1)
2023 c. 52.Citation, commencement, extent, interpretation and application
1.—(1) These Regulations may be cited as the Hydrogen Production Revenue Support (Directions, Eligibility and Counterparty) Regulations 2023 and come into force on the day after the day on which they are made (“the commencement date”).
(2) These Regulations extend to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
(3) References to a numbered section are to that section as numbered in the Energy Act 2023.
(4) These Regulations apply for the purposes of a hydrogen production revenue support contract(1) entered into pursuant to a direction made by the Secretary of State under section 66(1).
(1)
A “hydrogen production revenue support contract” is defined by section 65(2) of the Energy Act 2023 which for the purposes of these Regulations means a contract entered into by a hydrogen production counterparty pursuant to a direction made by the Secretary of State under section 66(1).Meaning of “eligible low carbon hydrogen producer”
2.—(1) In this regulation—
“standard compliant hydrogen” means hydrogen produced in accordance with the low carbon hydrogen standard;
“the low carbon hydrogen standard” means the document published by the Secretary of State in April 2023 entitled “UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard - Version 2” or such standard as may be from time to time published for the purposes of these Regulations by the Secretary of State(1).
(2) Where, pursuant to regulation 2(1) (low carbon hydrogen standard), the Secretary of State publishes a new or revised low carbon hydrogen standard for the purposes of these Regulations, the publication of the new or revised standard must include, or be accompanied by, a statement in writing that it is published to replace the previous version of the standard.
(3) A low carbon hydrogen producer is, for the purposes of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the Energy Act 2023, an “eligible low carbon hydrogen producer”(2) in relation to proposals it makes for the production of standard compliant hydrogen where—
(a)
the Secretary of State issues an invitation to low carbon hydrogen producers to apply for financial support (in the form of a hydrogen production revenue support contract) in the carrying out of proposals they make for the production of standard compliant hydrogen;
(b)
in response to that invitation, the low carbon hydrogen producer, in accordance with the requirements of the invitation, applies for such financial support in the carrying out of its proposals; and
(c)
the Secretary of State assesses that if the proposals are carried out, hydrogen produced as a result would be standard compliant hydrogen.
(4) A low carbon hydrogen producer is also an “eligible low carbon hydrogen producer” in respect of proposals made by it for the production of hydrogen, where—
(a)
before the commencement date, the Secretary of State issued an invitation to hydrogen producers to apply for financial support in the carrying out of proposals made by them for the production of hydrogen;
(b)
before the commencement date, the low carbon hydrogen producer applied in accordance with the terms of the invitation for financial support; and
(c)
the Secretary of State assessed before or after the commencement date that the proposals made by the low carbon hydrogen producer are capable of meeting the first version of the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard published in July 2022.
(5) But a low carbon hydrogen producer is not to be regarded as an eligible low carbon hydrogen producer if its proposal to produce standard compliant hydrogen involves the use of existing facilities without the carrying out of works to increase the capacity of those facilities to produce such hydrogen.
(6) A person who is an eligible low carbon hydrogen producer is not subsequently rendered ineligible merely on account of the publication of a new version of the low carbon hydrogen standard, but a direction issued by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 66(1) may require a hydrogen production revenue support contract to be offered on terms that require compliance with a later version of the standard.
(1)
Paper copies of the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard are available from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.
(2)
The expression “low carbon hydrogen producer” is defined by section 65(7) of the Energy Act 2023 as “a person who carries on (or is to carry on) in the United Kingdom activities of producing hydrogen which in the opinion of the Secretary of State will contribute to a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases”; “greenhouse gas” has the same meaning as section 92(1) of the Climate Change Act 2008.Directions pursuant to section 66(1) of the Energy Act 2023
3.—(1) A direction given by the Secretary of State to a hydrogen production counterparty(1) pursuant to section 66(1), must—
(a)
be in writing;
(b)
specify the date on which it is given;
(c)
specify the name of the eligible low carbon hydrogen producer (and its registered number if it is a company) with whom the counterparty is required to offer to contract;
(d)
specify the terms that must be included in the hydrogen production revenue support contract to be offered by the hydrogen production counterparty to the eligible low carbon hydrogen producer;
(e)
prohibit the hydrogen production counterparty from modifying those terms (whether by making additions, omissions, amendments, substitutions or otherwise) when offering to contract except with the prior written consent of the Secretary of State;
(f)
specify the date by the end of which the hydrogen production counterparty must comply with the direction; and
(g)
specify the length of time for which the offer must be open for acceptance by the eligible low carbon hydrogen producer.
(2) The date specified for the purposes of paragraph (1)(f), must—
(a)
in the case of a direction given on a working day, be no earlier than the twentieth working day beginning with the day on which the direction is given;
(b)
in the case of a direction given on a day that is not a working day, be no earlier than the twentieth working day beginning with the first working day following the day on which the direction is given.
(3) The Secretary of State must send a copy of the direction to the eligible low carbon hydrogen producer specified in it by the end of the fifth working day following the day on which the direction is given.
(4) For the purposes of this regulation, “working day” means any day except a Saturday, a Sunday, Christmas day, Good Friday or a bank holiday within the meaning of the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 in England and Wales.

(b)
no written acceptance of the offer is received by the hydrogen production counterparty from the eligible low carbon hydrogen producer to whom the offer is made, by the end of the period within which the hydrogen production counterparty requires acceptance of the offer to be received by it; or
(c)
the direction is revoked by the Secretary of State pursuant to regulation 5 (Revocation of a direction by the Secretary of State).
(2) Where an offer lapses in the circumstances referred to in paragraph (1), the hydrogen production counterparty must forthwith notify the eligible low carbon hydrogen producer of that fact.Revocation of a direction by the Secretary of State
5.—(1) The Secretary of State may by notice in writing revoke a direction given pursuant to section 66(1) provided that, where an offer has been made pursuant to that direction, that offer has not been accepted in writing by the eligible low carbon hydrogen producer to which it is made.
(2) A notice given under paragraph (1) is of no effect unless it is delivered to the eligible low carbon hydrogen producer named in that direction and the hydrogen production counterparty.
(3) A notice given under paragraph (1) must specify the date on which it is made and identify the direction to which it relates.Publication of hydrogen production revenue support contracts

contain personal data.
(3) Paragraph (2) does not apply to the low carbon hydrogen strike price (as defined in paragraph 8 of the Schedule).
(4) The Secretary of State may only give the hydrogen production counterparty a notice in writing under paragraph (2)(b), where the Secretary of State considers that those parts of the contract that the Secretary of State requires to be redacted contain information which—
(a)
constitutes a trade secret; or
(b)
if disclosed, would—
(i)
be likely to be harmful to the commercial interests of any person; or
(ii)
give rise to an actionable breach of confidence.

S.I. 2004/3391.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in connection with the offering by a hydrogen production counterparty designated under section 65 of the Energy Act 2023 of contracts for the production of hydrogen by eligible low carbon hydrogen producers (referred to in the Act as “hydrogen production revenue support contracts”). Such contracts must be offered following a direction from the Secretary of State pursuant to section 66(1) of the 2023 Act. A direction may only be made in favour of an “eligible low carbon hydrogen producer”.
Section 66(4) of the Act provides that the Secretary of State must make regulations which define the meaning of “eligible”. This is achieved by regulation 2. This provides that a low carbon hydrogen producer is “an eligible low carbon hydrogen producer” if—
(a)
the Secretary of State invites applications from low carbon hydrogen producers for the provision of financial support (in the form of a hydrogen production revenue support contracts) for the carrying out of proposals made by them for the production of hydrogen in accordance with the low carbon hydrogen standard (defined as the document published by the Secretary of State in April 2023 entitled “UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard – version 2” and hydrogen meeting the requirements of the standard being referred to in the Regulations as “standard compliant hydrogen”);
(b)
in response to that invitation from the Secretary of State, the low carbon hydrogen producer makes an application for financial support for the carrying out of its proposals to produce standard compliant hydrogen; and
(c)
the Secretary of State assesses that the proposals made by the low carbon hydrogen producer are capable of producing standard compliant hydrogen.
Regulation 2(1) provides that the Secretary of State may publish revised versions of the low carbon hydrogen standard from time to time. The Secretary of State must be satisfied that a proposal for the production of standard compliant hydrogen would be able to meet the version of the low carbon hydrogen standard published for the purposes of these Regulations which is current at the time the proposal is made. This avoids a low carbon hydrogen producer becoming ineligible if there is an intervening change in the low carbon hydrogen standard. However, the Secretary of State may still direct the hydrogen production counterparty to offer to contract on terms that require compliance with a later version of the standard. Regulation 2(5) provides that a low carbon hydrogen producer is not eligible in relation to a proposal that involves the use of existing facilities unless the proposals involve an increase in the capacity of those facilities to produce standard compliant hydrogen. Regulation 2(4) makes provision in relation to the eligibility of low carbon hydrogen producers who have made proposals before the date these Regulations came into force.
Regulation 3 makes provision as to the form and contents of directions made by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 66 of the Energy Act 2023. Regulation 4 makes provision as to when a direction ceases to have effect. Regulation 5 confers a power on the Secretary of State to revoke directions and sets out the procedure to be followed in such a case.
Regulation 6 contains requirements regarding the publication of contracts entered into pursuant to a direction made by the Secretary of State. Regulation 7 and the Schedule make provision for the creation and maintenance of a register of contracts entered into following a direction made by the Secretary of State. Regulation 8 makes provision requiring the Secretary of State to provide the hydrogen production counterparty with estimates of the costs of hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure associated with the production of low carbon hydrogen. Regulation 9 contains requirements for a counterparty to notify the Secretary of State if it is, or is likely to be, unable to perform its obligations under or by virtue of the 2023 Act, regulations made under the Act or a hydrogen production revenue support contract.
An impact assessment was prepared for the Energy Act 2023 in relation to hydrogen and industrial carbon capture business models.

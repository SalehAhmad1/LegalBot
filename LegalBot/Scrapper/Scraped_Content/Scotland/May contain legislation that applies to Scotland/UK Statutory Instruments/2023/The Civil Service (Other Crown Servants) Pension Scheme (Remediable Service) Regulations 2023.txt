4th September 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25) (“PSPA 2013”) makes provision, and confers powers to make further provision (in the form of “scheme regulations” as defined in section 1 of PSPA 2013), about the establishment of public service pension schemes. The Civil Service (Other Crown Servants) Pension Scheme Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/326) (“the 2016 Regulations”) establishes a scheme by analogy to the Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1964) (“the 2014 Regulations”) with some modifications. The 2014 Regulations provided for transitional protection for certain cohorts of members of predecessor schemes, and this transitional protection was mirrored in the by-analogy scheme established by the 2016 Regulations. The transitional protection was subsequently found to unlawfully discriminate between pension scheme members on the basis of age.
The Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7) (“PSPJOA 2022”), at Chapter 1, makes provision, and confers powers for scheme regulations under PSPA 2013 to make further provision, in relation to “remediable service” (as defined in section 1 of PSPJOA 2022) of members who benefitted from transitional protection, and of members who did not benefit from transitional protection only by reason of their age.
These Regulations are scheme regulations under PSPA 2013 and in accordance with PSPJOA 2022. These Regulations have retrospective effect, which is authorised by section 3(3)(b) of PSPA 2013.
Regulation 3 provides for these Regulations to operate by analogy to the Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions (Remediable Service) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/942) (“the 2023 Regulations”).
Regulation 4 modifies the 2023 Regulations to secure that they operate properly in relation to the scheme established by the 2016 Regulations and its predecessor schemes.
An impact assessment has not been completed for these Regulations. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on http://www.legislation.gov.uk.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Royal Air Force Cosford, 
Shropshire during flying displays that are scheduled to take place there between 9th June 2023 and 
11th June 2023 (inclusive). 
A fast jet formation team will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and 
therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should 
be restricted in the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
These Regulations apply except insofar as flying is already prohibited by the Air Navigation 
(Restriction of Flying) (Royal Air Force Cosford) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/485). 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(2) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(3)(a)(i), the Cosford Air Show flying 
display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Briefing Sheet and Notice to 
Aviation (NOTAM).

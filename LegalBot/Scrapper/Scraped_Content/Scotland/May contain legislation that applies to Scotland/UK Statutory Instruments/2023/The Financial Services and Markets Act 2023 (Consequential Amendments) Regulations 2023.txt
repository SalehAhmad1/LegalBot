19th December 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of these Regulations)
Section 1 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (c. 29) (“the Act”) revokes (or, where appropriate, repeals) retained EU law which is referred to in Schedule 1 to the Act.
These revocations and repeals include—
the revocation of Article 92b of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012;
the revocation of legislation relating to Long-Term Investment Funds (“LTIFs”);
Part 2 of, and Schedules 1 and 2 to, the Payment Accounts Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/2038); and
the repeal of legislation containing certain restrictions on powers of the Financial Conduct Authority to make rules that modify, amend or revoke retained direct EU legislation.
Those particular revocations and repeals take effect on 1st January 2024 by virtue of regulation 5 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (Commencement No. 1) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/779 (C. 40)).
Regulations 2 to 4, 6 to 9, 11, 13 to 16 and 18 make consequential amendments in connection with those revocations and repeals.
These Regulations also make various other amendments that are consequential on the Act or provision made under it.
Regulation 5 amends section 50(12) of the Act in consequence of section 21(4)(b) of the Act, to provide that the required content of the Bank of England’s annual report on its regulation of financial market infrastructure is consistent with its regulatory obligations.
Regulation 10 amends the Payment Card Interchange Fee Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1911) (“the PCIFRs”) in consequence of the amendments made to the PCIFRs by regulation 3 of the Electronic Money, Payment Card Interchange and Payment Services (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/790), which were made under section 3 of the Act.
Regulations 12, 17, 19 and 20 amend the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Markets in Financial Instruments Regulations) 2017 (S.I. 2017/701), Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (“MiFIR”) and two related delegated Regulations. The amendments to these instruments are consequential on the omission of Article 5 of MiFIR by paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the Act.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

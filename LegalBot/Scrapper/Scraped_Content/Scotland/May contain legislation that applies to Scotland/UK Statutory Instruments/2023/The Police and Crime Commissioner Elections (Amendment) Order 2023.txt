17th November 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Police and Crime Commissioner Elections Order 2012 (S.I. 2012/1917) (“the 2012 Order”) to increase the limits for candidate election expenses for Police and Crime Commissioner (“PCC”) elections. The figures have increased by 36.92% (rounded to 2 decimal places) and then rounded down to the nearest £10, the extent of the increase also reflects the duration of time that has passed since the limits were introduced in 2012. This Order replaces the existing maximum amount of election expenses with the new maximum amount of election expenses that may be incurred in the aggregate by or on behalf of a candidate at a PCC election for the corresponding police area.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

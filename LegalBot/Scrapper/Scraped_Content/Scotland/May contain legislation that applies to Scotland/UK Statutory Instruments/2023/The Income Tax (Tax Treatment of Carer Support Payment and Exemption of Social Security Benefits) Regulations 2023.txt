26th October 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments and provide for a modification to Part 10 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (c. 1) (“ITEPA”), so as to provide that the Scottish carer support payment is a social security benefit chargeable to income tax and that no liability to income tax arises on certain other social security benefits specified in the Regulations.
Regulation 2 amends section 660 of ITEPA by inserting a new row into Table A, in order to specify that the Scottish carer support payment (“CSP”) is a social security benefit chargeable to income tax. It also amends section 661 of ITEPA, which specifies how the amount of taxable social security income from a benefit for a tax year is calculated, by inserting a reference to CSP, and makes a consequential amendment to section 658 of ITEPA. Regulation 2 also makes a consequential amendment to the Table in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to ITEPA to insert an abbreviation for the Carer’s Assistance (Carer Support Payment) (Scotland) Regulations 2023 (S.S.I. 2023/302).
Regulation 3 amends section 677 of ITEPA by inserting a new row into Part 1 of Table B and three new rows into Part 2 of Table B, in order to wholly exempt from income tax payments to families to provide food and drink free of charge in relation to children eligible for free school meals in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, and payments made under the Healthy Start and Scottish Best Start Foods schemes. It also makes consequential amendments to the Table in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to ITEPA by inserting definitions of the abbreviations inserted into Table B in section 677 by regulation 3(2).
Regulation 4 modifies the effect of section 677 of ITEPA in order to wholly exempt from income tax payments made under family network support packages as part of the families first for children pathfinder programme and family networks pilot scheme.
Regulations 3 and 4 are made in exercise of the powers in section 13(1) and 13(2)(b), (c) and (d) of the Finance Act 2020 (c. 14). Section 13(2)(b) provides that regulations made under section 13(1) of that Act may be applied retrospectively. Regulations 3(4) and (5) and regulation 4(3) set out the tax years in relation to which the amendments made by regulation 3 and the modification made by regulation 4, respectively, have effect.

At 10.58 a.m. on 21st February 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1964) established the new Civil Service pension scheme, also known as alpha, and made provision for the contributions payable by members of that scheme up to 31st March 2023.
Regulation 2 provides for the member contribution rates for the scheme year ending on 31st March 2023 to also apply to the scheme year beginning 1st April 2023 and subsequently, as against revised annualised rate of pensionable earnings bands.
Regulation 2 also provides for the revised annualised rate of pensionable earnings bands to be uprated on the first day of each scheme year by reference to the consumer prices index (or any other UK price index the Minister may choose), beginning on 1st April 2024 for the salary band £0-£32,000 and beginning on 1st April 2027 for salary band £32,001-£56,000.
Since these Regulations involve a change to a protected element of the scheme, the Minister for the Civil Service has consulted representatives of those likely to be affected by the change with a view to reaching agreement and has laid a report before Parliament.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

26th October 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Armed Forces (Minor Punishments and Limitation on Reduction in Rank) Regulations 2023 by substituting a new regulation 5.
Regulation 5 prohibits the combination of each minor punishment available to commanding officers with certain other punishments (minor or otherwise). The substituted regulation allows deprivation orders, which were introduced through the Armed Forces Act 2021 (c. 35) to be awarded at the same time as each of the minor punishments.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

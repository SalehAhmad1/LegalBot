the TRA to give alternative options, in certain circumstances, in its recommendations to the Secretary of State;
the Secretary of State to ask the TRA to reassess its recommendation in certain circumstances;
the Secretary of State to act other than in accordance with the TRA recommendation;
the Secretary of State to seek advice, information and support from the TRA;
make corresponding amendments to Part 7 (suspension) and Part 7A (investigation in light of an international dispute decision) of the Safeguards Regulations;
amend the Schedule to the Safeguards Regulations so that notices required under Schedule 5 to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (c. 22) and the Safeguards Regulations reflect the amendments made by these Regulations.

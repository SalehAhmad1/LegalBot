(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Food (Promotion and Placement) (England) Regulations 2021 (“the Principal Regulations”) provide for restrictions on the marketing in a store or on an online marketplace of certain foods and drinks that are less healthy. Regulations 5 and 6 (relating to volume price promotions, including free drink refills) are due to come into force on 1st October 2023.
These Regulations amend the Principal Regulations so that regulations 5 and 6 instead come into force on 1st October 2025. They also amend regulation 5(5) to clarify that the volume price promotion restriction does not apply to food which includes a volume price promotion on its packaging for a period of 12 months beginning on the day regulation 5 comes into force.

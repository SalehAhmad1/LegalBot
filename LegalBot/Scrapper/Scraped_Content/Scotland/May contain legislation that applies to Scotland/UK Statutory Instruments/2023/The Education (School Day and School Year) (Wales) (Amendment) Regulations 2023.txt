16 January 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Education (School Day and School Year) (Wales) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”) make provision about the length of the school day, which is ordinarily divided into two sessions with a break in the middle, and for schools to meet for at least 380 sessions during any school year.
These Regulations amend the definition of “school” in regulation 3 of the 2003 Regulations, to reflect amendments made to section 342 of the Education Act 1996(1) by section 57 of the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018(2). The 2003 Regulations will therefore apply to schools maintained by a local authority.
They amend regulation 4(8) of the 2003 Regulations to reduce the minimum number of school sessions which must be held in the 2022–2023 school year from 380 to 376. This reflects the additional bank holidays on 19 September 2022 for the State Funeral of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and 8 May 2023 to mark the occasion of the Coronation of His Majesty King Charles III.
They also amend regulation 5 of the 2003 Regulations to provide for no more than two sessions in each of the 2022–2023, 2023–2024 and 2024–2025 school years to count as sessions on which the school has met, if those sessions are devoted (wholly or mainly) to any of the matters prescribed.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Legislation and Governance Branch, Schools Effectiveness Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

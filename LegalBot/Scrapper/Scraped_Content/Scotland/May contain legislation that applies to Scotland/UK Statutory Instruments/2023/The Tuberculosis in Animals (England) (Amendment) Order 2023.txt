(b)
impose an obligation on the keeper who receives a bovine animal in a specified area (as defined) to arrange a post-movement skin test (article 2(2), (4) and (6));
(c)
provide that a post-movement skin test is not required where a bovine animal moves directly to an approved finishing unit or an exempt finishing unit (article 2(4));
(d)
provide that a bovine animal can be moved to an exempt finishing unit in addition to the movements already permitted under article 20(4) of the Principal Order, pending the results of a post-skin movement test being available (article 2(5)).

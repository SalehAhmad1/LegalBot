“Article 5c
Activity level changes: average activity level omitting 2020 data
1.  The operator of an installation may apply for a determination by the UK ETS authority that a sub-installation of the installation meets the Covid condition referred to in Article 5b if, on submission of the 2021 activity level report under Article 3, Article 5(1) required an adjustment to decrease free allocation of allowances in respect of the sub-installation for the 2021 and subsequent scheme years.
2.  But an application may not be made if the regulator made an estimate of the value of a parameter under Article 3(4)(a) because the operator did not submit the 2021 activity level report or the 2022 activity level report on or before the date referred to in Article 3(3).
3.  An application must be made to the regulator on or before 31 January 2024 or such later date as the regulator may specify if, in a case where the operator requests an extension of time on or before 31 January 2024, the regulator considers that the reason for the request is reasonable.
4.  An application must be accompanied by:
(a)
either:
(i)
a report identifying the quantity of emissions attributable to the sub-installation in 2019 and in 2020, determined in accordance with the methodology in the monitoring methodology plan and verified as satisfactory in accordance with the Verification Regulation 2018 as if the data in the report formed part of a baseline data report; or
(ii)
where the data referred to in subpoint (i) are included in the 2021 activity level report, a statement by the verifier that the verification of the report included the verification of those data; and
(b)
evidence that the sub-installation meets point (c) of the Covid condition set out in Article 5b(2), including an explanation why, when comparing 2020 to 2019 levels, the emissions attributable to the sub-installation did not fall by at least the same proportion as its activity level.
5.  After receiving an application, the regulator must, as soon as reasonably practicable:
(a)
assess whether or not the sub-installation meets the Covid condition; and
(b)
send the assessment and the reasons for it to the UK ETS authority.
6.  After receiving the assessment, the UK ETS authority must determine whether or not the sub-installation meets the Covid condition.
7.  If the UK ETS authority determines that the sub-installation meets the Covid condition:
(a)
the regulator must calculate the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the sub-installation for each scheme year in the 2021-2025 allocation period that would have been set out in the allocation table on compliance by the regulator and the UK ETS authority with the requirements of this Regulation and the UK ETS Order following submission of the 2021, 2022 and 2023 activity level reports if:
(i)
the average activity level of the sub-installation required to be determined under Article 4 on submission of the 2021 activity level report had been based on the activity levels of the sub-installation in 2018(1) and 2019 (and not on those in 2019 and 2020); and
(ii)
the average activity level of the sub-installation required to be determined under Article 4 on submission of the 2022 activity level report had been based on the activity levels of the sub-installation in 2019 and 2021 (and not on those in 2020 and 2021);
(b)
the regulator must send to the UK ETS authority:
(i)
the calculation referred to in point (a); and
(ii)
the regulator’s recalculation of the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for each scheme year in the 2021-2025 allocation period, taking account of the calculation referred to in point (a);
(c)
the UK ETS authority must:
(i)
approve the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for each scheme year in the 2021-2025 allocation period, making any corrections to the final annual number of allowances that the UK ETS authority considers appropriate; and
(ii)
inform the regulator accordingly;
(d)
the regulator must inform the operator of the installation of the final annual number of allowances approved.
8.  For the purposes of Article 5, the reference in paragraph 2 of that Article to an adjustment approved under Article 6a must be read as including a reference to an adjustment approved under paragraph 7(c) of this Article.
9.  If the UK ETS authority determines that the sub-installation does not meet the Covid condition:
(a)
the UK ETS authority must inform the regulator; and
(b)
the regulator must inform the operator.
10.  In this Article:
(a)
“2021 activity level report” means the activity level report (on activity levels in 2019 and 2020) due on or before 30 June 2021;

Deputy Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (the “UK ETS”) was established by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 (the “UK ETS Order”). The UK ETS runs for ten “scheme years” beginning with 2021, split into two five-year “allocation periods”. Operators of certain industrial installations and certain aircraft operators are required to monitor, submit verified reports on, and surrender “allowances” equivalent to, their greenhouse gas emissions in each scheme year. Allowances (which are tradable) are held in accounts in the UK ETS registry, and there is a cap on the number of allowances that may be created. Allowances are sold at auction, but some operators of installations and aircraft operators receive an allocation of allowances free of charge. Free allocation for installations may change from year to year depending on the installation’s activity level. For installations that meet the eligibility criteria, there are two schemes in addition to the main scheme, one for “hospital or small emitters”, the other for “ultra-small emitters”.
This Order amends the UK ETS Order, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 (the “Free Allocation Regulation”) and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1842 (the “Activity Level Changes Regulation”).
Free allocation for installations
For the purpose of calculating free allocation in the 2024 and 2025 scheme years, the product benchmark for lime is increased and the production of malt extract is included as a sector at risk of carbon leakage: see article 20 of this Order and amendments to articles 34B and 34C of the UK ETS Order. Installations that currently benefit from free allocation will have their allocation recalculated.
The benchmarks used for calculating free allocation for scheme years in the 2021-2025 allocation period (which are currently in EU legislation) are set out in a new Annex 8 to the Free Allocation Regulation. (See also amendments to Articles 16 and 18 of, and to section 4 of Annex 7 to, that Regulation.) These benchmarks (rather than those used for the EU Emissions Trading System) will also be used for calculating free allocation in the 2026-2030 allocation period (unless the legislation is amended).
Operators of installations whose allocations were reduced by the 2021 activity level changes process may apply for activity level changes to be recalculated, using data from other years instead of 2020 to calculate average activity levels: see amendment to article 34C of the UK ETS Order and amendment to Article 5b, and new Article 5c, of the Activity Level Changes Regulation.
An amendment to Article 6 of the Activity Level Changes Regulation (which relates to when adjustments (upwards or downwards) to free allocation as part of the activity level change process may be rejected on energy efficiency grounds) provides for the codes in Sections B and C of NACE rev.2 to be used where there is no PRODCOM code.
The information that the operator of a hospital or small emitter or an ultra-small emitter that returns to the main scheme and wishes to benefit from free allocation must provide now includes an additional requirement to provide information to enable the “historical activity level” of sub-installations to be determined where not previously determined as part of the original application: see amendments to article 34G of, and Schedule 8A to, the UK ETS Order.
Miscellaneous
Holders of operator and aircraft operator holding accounts may apply for a new type of permission for account authorised representatives, limited to enabling representatives to surrender, and return overallocated, allowances: see amendments to paragraph 16 of Schedule 5A to the UK ETS Order.
Article 24 of the UK ETS Order provides that Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 (the “Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018”) has effect for the purposes of the UK ETS, with modifications. A further signposting modification is made to Article 49 of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018: see the amendment to Schedule 4 to the UK ETS Order.

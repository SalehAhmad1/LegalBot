11 October 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Council Tax (Alteration of Lists and Appeals) Regulations 1993 (“the 1993 Regulations”).
The 1993 Regulations set out the circumstances in which a valuation list can be altered. Regulation 14 of those Regulations specifies the day from which an alteration has effect.
These Regulations amend the day from which an alteration has effect when the list is altered due to a material increase in the value of a property, and where a dwelling should be treated as two or more dwellings pursuant to the Council Tax (Chargeable Dwellings) Order 1992 (S.I. 1992/549). In both circumstances these Regulations specify the day as the day on which the alteration is entered in the list.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

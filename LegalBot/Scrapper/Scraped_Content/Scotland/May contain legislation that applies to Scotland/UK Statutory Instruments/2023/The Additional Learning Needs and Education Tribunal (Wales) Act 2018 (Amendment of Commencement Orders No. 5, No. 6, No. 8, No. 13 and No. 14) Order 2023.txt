This Order amends the requirement in Commencement Orders No. 5, No. 6, No. 8, No. 13 and No. 14 in relation to the 2023-2024 school year, so that the IDP notice or the No IDP notice can be given during the 2023-2024 school year or the 2024-2025 school year. This extension does not apply to children who are in year 6 or in year 10 during the 2023-2024 school year.

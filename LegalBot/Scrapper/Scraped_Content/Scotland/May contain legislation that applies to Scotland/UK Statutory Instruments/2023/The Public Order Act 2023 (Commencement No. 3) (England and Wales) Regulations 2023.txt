Regulation 2 brings into force sections 10, 11, 12, 13 (to the extent not already in force) and 14 of the Act.
Section 10 amends section 1(8) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”) to extend police suspicion-led stop and search powers in relation to prohibited articles to include seven additional protest-related offences.
Section 11 makes provision for suspicion-less stop and search powers in relation to protest-related offences.

Section 13 contains further provisions relating to searches under section 11.

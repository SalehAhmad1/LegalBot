An application has been made to the Secretary of State under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008(1) (“the 2008 Act”) in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009(2) for an Order granting development consent.
The application was examined by a Panel of two members (appointed by the Secretary of State) in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010(3).
The Panel, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn and the application together with the accompanying documents, in accordance with section 83 of the 2008 Act, have submitted a report and recommendation to the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn, and the report of the Panel, has decided to make an Order granting development consent for the development described in the application with modifications which in the opinion of the Secretary of State do not make any substantial changes to the proposals comprised in the application.
The Secretary of State is satisfied that replacement land has been or will be given in exchange for the special category land (as defined in article 38(5) of this Order), and the replacement land (as defined in that article) has been or will be vested in the prospective seller and subject to the same rights, trusts and incidents as attach to the special category land, and that, accordingly, section 131(4) of the 2008 Act applies.
The Secretary of State is satisfied that the special category (rights) land (as defined in article 38(5) of this Order), when burdened with any new rights authorised to be compulsorily acquired under this Order, will be no less advantageous than it was before to the persons in whom it is vested, other persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other rights, and the public, and that, accordingly, section 132(3) of the 2008 Act applies.
The Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 114, 115(4), 117, 120 and 122 of, and paragraphs 1 to 3, 10 to 17, 19 to 23, 26, 33, 36 and 37 of Part 1 of Schedule 5(5) to, the 2008 Act, makes the following Order—

Section 59 was amended by section 42 of the Traffic Management Act 2004.Construction and maintenance of new, altered or diverted streets and other structures
13.—(1) Any highway (other than a trunk road) to be constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority in whose area the highway lies and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, the highway including any culverts or other structures laid under it must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(2) Where a highway (other than a trunk road) is altered or diverted under this Order, the altered or diverted part of the highway must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, that part of the highway including any culverts or other structures laid under it must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(3) Where a street which is not and is not intended to be a public highway is constructed, altered or diverted under this Order, the street (or part of the street as the case may be) must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and unless otherwise agreed in writing with the street authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from its completion and at the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the street authority.
(4) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a trunk road) over a trunk road, the highway surface must from its completion be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority and the structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority.
(5) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(6) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (5), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.Classification of roads, etc.
14.—(1) On a date to be determined by the undertaker, the roads described in Part 1 (trunk roads) of Schedule 3 (classification of roads, etc.) are to become trunk roads as if they had become so by virtue of an order under section 10(2)(1) (general provision as to trunk roads) of the 1980 Act specifying that date as the date on which they were to become trunk roads.
(2) On a date to be determined by the undertaker, the roads described in Part 2 (de-trunked roads) of Schedule 3 are to cease to be trunk roads as if they had ceased to be trunk roads by virtue of an order made under section 10(2) of the 1980 Act specifying that date as the date on which they were to cease to be trunk roads.
(3) On a date to be determined by the undertaker, the roads described in Part 3 (classified roads) of Schedule 3 are to become classified roads for the purpose of any enactment or instrument which refers to highways classified as classified roads as if such classification had been made under section 12(3) (general provision as to principal and classified roads) of the 1980 Act.
(4) On a date to be determined by the undertaker, the roads described in Part 4 (unclassified roads) of Schedule 3 are to become unclassified roads for the purpose of any enactment or instrument which refers to unclassified roads.

(6) On and after a date to be determined by the undertaker, the restrictions specified in column (3) of Part 6 (traffic regulation measures (clearways and prohibitions)) of Schedule 3 are to apply to the lengths of road identified in the corresponding row of column (2) of that Part.
(7) On a date to be determined by the undertaker, the orders specified in column (3) of Part 7 (revocations and variations of existing traffic regulation orders) of Schedule 3 are to be varied or revoked as specified in the corresponding row of column (4) of that Part in respect of the lengths of roads specified in the corresponding row of column (2) of that Part.
(8) Unless otherwise agreed with the relevant planning authority, the public rights of way set out in Part 8 (public rights of way) of Schedule 3 and identified on the streets rights of way and access plans are to be constructed by the undertaker in the specified locations and open for use on a date to be determined by the undertaker provided that as a result there are no materially new or different effects from those assessed in the environmental statement.
(9) The application of paragraphs (1) to (8) may be varied or revoked by any instrument made under any enactment which provides for the variation or revocation of such matters, including by an instrument made under the 1984 Act where the matter in question could have been included in an order made under that Act or with the written consent of the Secretary of State.

(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in such position as described in sub-paragraph (a).
(3) Subject to the following provisions of this article, the undertaker must pay to any statutory utility an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the utility in or in connection with—
(a)
the execution of the relocation works required in consequence of the stopping up of the street; and
(b)
the doing of any other work or thing rendered necessary by the execution of the relocation works.

(a)
apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and

where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.

(7) Paragraphs (3) to (6) do not apply where the authorised development constitutes major highway works, major bridge works or major transport works for the purposes of Part 3 of the 1991 Act, but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of cost of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section; and

(2) Paragraph (1) does not apply in the case of the removal of a public sewer but where such a sewer is removed under article 35, any person who is—
(a)
the owner or occupier of premises the drains of which communicated with that sewer; or
(b)
the owner of a private sewer which communicated with that sewer,
is entitled to recover from the undertaker compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of making the drain or sewer belonging to that person communicate with any other public sewer or with a private sewerage disposal plant.
(3) This article does not have effect in relation to apparatus to which article 36 (apparatus and rights of statutory undertakers in stopped up streets) or Part 3 of the 1991 Act applies.
(4) In this article—
“public communications provider” has the same meaning as in section 151(1) of the Communications Act 2003; and
“public utility undertaker” means a gas, water, electricity or sewerage undertaker.Special category land
38.—(1) The special category land is not to vest in the undertaker until the undertaker has acquired the replacement land and the Secretary of State (in consultation with the relevant planning authority) has certified that a satisfactory scheme for the provision of the replacement land as open space and a satisfactory timetable for the implementation of the scheme has been received from the undertaker.
(2) On the requirements of paragraph (1) being satisfied, the special category land is to vest in the undertaker and be discharged from all rights, trusts and incidents to which it was previously subject.
(3) On the requirements of paragraph (1) being satisfied, the rights to be acquired over the special category (rights) land are to vest in the undertaker and the special category (rights) land is to be discharged from all private rights to which it was previously subject in accordance with article 28(2) (private rights over land).

SCHEDULE 6
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS AND IMPOSITION OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation for the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 6 to the A38 Derby Junctions Development Consent Order 2023 (the “A38 Derby Junctions Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 6 to the A38 Derby Junctions Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enter on and take possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 29 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 23 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 26(1) (compulsory acquisition of rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 23), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 29(4) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND NOT IN NOTICE TO TREAT
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or a restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 30 (application of the 1981 Act) of the A38 Derby Junctions Development Consent Order 2023 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 31(3) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the A38 Derby Junctions Development Consent Order 2023 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right of the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making the determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawing of the notice.
15.  Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS
PART 1
FOR THE PROTECTION OF ELECTRICITY, WATER AND SEWERAGE UNDERTAKERS
1.  For the protection of the utility undertakers referred to in this Part of this Schedule the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the utility undertaker concerned.
2.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the utility undertaker in question to fulfil its statutory function in a manner no less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means—
(a)
in the case of an electricity undertaker, electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(1), belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker;
(b)
in the case of a water undertaker, mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker for the purposes of water supply; and
(c)
in the case of a sewerage undertaker—
(i)
any drain or works vested in the utility undertaker under the Water Industry Act 1991(2); and
(ii)
any sewer which is so vested or is the subject of a notice of intention to adopt given under section 102(4)(3) (adoption of sewers and disposal works) of that Act or an agreement to adopt made under section 104(4) (agreements to adopt sewer, drain or sewage disposal works, at future date) of that Act,
and includes a sludge main, disposal main (within the meaning of section 219 (general interpretation) of that Act) or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming part of any such sewer, drain or works, and includes any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in” in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land;
“plan” includes all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably necessary properly and sufficiently to describe the works to be executed; and
“utility undertaker” means—
(a)
any licence holder within the meaning of Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989;
(b)
a water undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991; and
(c)
a sewerage undertaker within the meaning of Part 1 of the Water Industry Act 1991,
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained.
On street apparatus
3.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus in stopped up streets
4.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 16 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access), any utility undertaker whose apparatus is in the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to the utility undertaker legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the utility undertaker in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of the utility undertaker to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 7 or the power of the undertaker to carry out works under paragraph 9.
(2) Regardless of the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under the powers conferred by article 15 (temporary stopping up and restriction of use of streets), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
5.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 21 (protective works to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
Acquisition of land
6.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
9.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) are to be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker, in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres measured in any direction of any electricity apparatus, the plan to be submitted to the utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) must be detailed, include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which they are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal;
(d)
the position of all electricity apparatus; and
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to such apparatus.
Expenses and costs
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker all expenses reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration) to be necessary then, if such placing involves cost exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 5 or 7(2) any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker and, if such consent is withheld, the undertaker has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Co-operation
12.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or a utility undertaker requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 7(2) or a utility undertaker makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 9, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the utility undertaker’s undertaking and each utility undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
13.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

the failure of any such work,
damage to a fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the Agency may serve notice on the undertaker requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage, or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.
(3) If within such time as may be reasonably practicable for that purpose after the receipt of written notice from the Agency of any damage or expected damage to a fishery, the undertaker fails to take such steps as are required under sub-paragraph (2), the Agency may take those steps and any expenditure reasonably incurred by the Agency in so doing shall be recoverable from the undertaker.
(4) In any case where immediate action by the Agency is reasonably required in order to secure that the risk of damage to the fishery is avoided or reduced, the Agency may take such steps as are reasonable for the purpose, and may recover from the undertaker any reasonable expenditure reasonably incurred in so doing provided that notice specifying those steps is served on the undertaker as soon as reasonably practicable after the Agency has taken, or commenced to take, the steps specified in the notice.

Network Rail must at all times afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker and its employees, contractors or agents for access to any works carried out by Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule during their construction and must supply the undertaker with such information as it may reasonably require with regard to such works or the method of constructing them.
37.—(1) If any permanent or temporary alterations or additions to railway property are reasonably necessary in consequence of the construction of a specified work or a protective work, or during a period of 24 months after the completion of that work in order to ensure the safety of railway property or the continued safe operation of the railway of Network Rail, such alterations or additions may be carried out by Network Rail and if Network Rail gives to the undertaker reasonable notice of its intention to carry out such alterations or additions (which must be specified in the notice), the undertaker must pay to Network Rail the reasonable cost of those alterations or additions including, in respect of any such alterations or additions as are to be permanent, a capitalised sum representing the increase of the costs which are expected to be reasonably incurred by Network Rail in maintaining, working and, when necessary, renewing any such alterations or additions.
(2) If during the construction of a specified work or a protective work by the undertaker, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct that part of the specified work or the protective work which in the opinion of the engineer is endangering the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker decides that part of the specified work or the protective work is to be constructed, Network Rail must assume construction of that part of the specified work or protective work and the undertaker must, regardless of any approval of the specified work or protective work in question under paragraph 33, pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may suffer by reason of the execution by Network Rail of that specified work or protective work.
(3) The engineer must, in respect of the capitalised sums referred to in this paragraph and paragraph 38(a), provide such details of the formula or method of calculation by which those sums have been calculated as the undertaker may reasonably require.
(4) If the cost of maintaining, working or renewing railway property is reduced in consequence of any such alterations or additions, a capitalised sum representing such saving must be set off against any sum payable by the undertaker to Network Rail under this paragraph.
38.  The undertaker must repay to Network Rail all reasonable fees, costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)
in constructing any part of a specified work on behalf of the undertaker as provided by paragraph 33(3) or in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 33(4) including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work or a protective work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signallers, watchkeepers and other persons whom it is reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer be required to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work or from the substitution or diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work.
39.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
“Network Rail’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised development) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 33 for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 33) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified under sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected at the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 33 has effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) If at any time prior to the completion of the authorised development and regardless of any measures adopted under sub-paragraph (3) the testing or commissioning of the authorised development causes EMI, the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI; and
(c)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus or such EMI.

(a)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
(b)
any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus approved pursuant to those sub-paragraphs must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 34.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 43(1) applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses suffered by Network Rail through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Network Rail’s apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which sub-paragraph (6) applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 38(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph are deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
(11) In relation to any dispute arising under this paragraph the reference in article 48 (arbitration) to the Institution of Civil Engineers is to be read as a reference to the Institution of Engineering and Technology.
40.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work or a protective work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work or the protective work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work or protective work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.
41.  The undertaker must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work or a protective work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Network Rail unless it has first consulted Network Rail and it must comply with Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.
Any additional expenses which Network Rail may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work or protective work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the undertaker, be repaid by the undertaker to Network Rail.
42.—(1) The undertaker must pay to Network Rail all reasonable costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part of this Schedule which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)
by reason of the construction or maintenance of a specified work or a protective work or the failure of it;
(b)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged upon a specified work or a protective work,
and the undertaker must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or protective work or any such failure, act or omission and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision will not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or its employees, contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Network Rail must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand is to be made without the prior written consent of the undertaker.
(3) The sums payable by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) shall if relevant include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs.
(4) Subject to the terms of any agreement between Network Rail and a train operator regarding the timing or method of payment of the relevant costs in respect of that train operator, Network Rail must promptly pay to each train operator the amount of any sums which Network Rail receives under sub-paragraph (3) which relates to the relevant costs of that train operator.
(5) The obligation under sub-paragraph (3) to pay Network Rail the relevant costs is, in the event of default, enforceable directly by any train operator concerned to the extent that such sums would be payable to that operator pursuant to sub-paragraph (4).
(6) In this paragraph—
“the relevant costs” means the costs, direct losses and expenses (including loss of revenue) reasonably incurred by each train operator as a consequence of any restriction of the use of Network Rail’s railway network as a result of the construction, maintenance or failure of a specified work or a protective work or any such act or omission as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1); and
“train operator” means any person who is authorised to act as the operator of a train by a licence under section 8 of the Railways Act 1993.
43.  Network Rail must, on receipt of a request from the undertaker, from time to time provide the undertaker free of charge with written estimates of the costs, charges, expenses and other liabilities for which the undertaker is or will become liable pursuant to this Part of this Schedule (including the amount of the relevant costs mentioned in paragraph 42) and with such information as may reasonably enable the undertaker to assess the reasonableness of any such estimate or claim made or to be made pursuant to this Part of this Schedule (including any claim relating to those relevant costs).
44.  In the assessment of any sums payable to Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule there must not be taken into account any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken by or any agreement entered into by Network Rail if that action or agreement was not reasonably necessary and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or increasing the sums so payable.
45.  The undertaker and Network Rail may, subject in the case of Network Rail to compliance with the terms of its network licence, enter into, and carry into effect, agreements for the transfer to the undertaker of—
(a)
any railway property shown on the works plans or the land plans and described in the book of reference;
(b)
any lands, works or other property held in connection with any such railway property; and

On Street Apparatus
51.—(1) This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and Cadent are regulated by the provision of Part 3 of the 1991 Act, except—
(a)
paragraphs 52 (apparatus of Cadent in stopped up streets), 57 (retained apparatus: protection of Cadent), 58 (expenses) and 59 (indemnity); and
(b)
where sub-paragraph (2) applies, paragraph 55 (removal of apparatus) and 56 (facilities and rights for alternative apparatus).
(2) This sub-paragraph applies where any apparatus is diverted from an alignment within the existing adopted public highway but is not wholly replaced within the existing public highway, notwithstanding that any diversion may be carried out under the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus of Cadent in stopped up streets
52.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 16 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access), if Cadent has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street Cadent is entitled to the same rights in respect of such apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to Cadent, or procure the granting to Cadent of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to Cadent in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up of any such street but nothing in this paragraph shall affect any right of the undertaker or of Cadent to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 55.
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under the powers of article 15 (temporary stopping up and restriction of use of streets), Cadent will be at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up highway and/or to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as it would have been entitled to do immediately before such temporary stopping up or diversion in respect of any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that highway
(3) The protective provisions in this Part of this Schedule apply and take precedence over article 36(2) to (7) (apparatus and rights of statutory undertakers in stopped up streets), which shall not apply to Cadent.
Protective works to buildings
53.—(1) The undertaker must exercise the powers conferred by article 21 (protective works to buildings), so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of Cadent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and, if by reason of the exercise of those powers any damage to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal or abandonment) or property of Cadent or any interruption in the supply of gas by Cadent, as the case may be, is caused, the undertaker must bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and, subject to sub-paragraph (2), must—
(a)
pay compensation to Cadent for any loss sustained by it; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent against all claims, demands, proceedings, costs, damages and expenses which may be made or taken against or recovered from or incurred by Cadent, by reason of any such damage or interruption.

Acquisition of land
54.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker may not appropriate or acquire any interest in land of Cadent, or appropriate, acquire, extinguish, interfere with or override any easement, other interest or right and/or apparatus of Cadent, otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of Cadent or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Cadent and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as Cadent reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent unless otherwise agreed by Cadent, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure or secure the consent to and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works.
(3) The undertaker and Cadent agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus/including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by Cadent or other enactments relied upon by Cadent as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Part of this Schedule shall prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by Cadent under paragraph 57 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) As a condition of an agreement between the parties under sub-paragraph (1) that involves de-commissioned apparatus being left in situ the undertaker must accept a surrender of any existing easement or other interest of Cadent in such decommissioned apparatus and release Cadent from all liabilities in respect of such decommissioned apparatus from the date of such surrender.
(6) Where the undertaker acquires land which is subject to any Cadent right or interest (including, without limitation, easements and agreements relating to rights or other interests) and the provisions of paragraph 55 do not apply, the undertaker must, unless Cadent agrees otherwise:
(a)
retain any notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land; or
(b)
(where no such notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register) include (with its application to register title to the undertaker’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry) a notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land.
Removal of apparatus
55.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, including pursuant to any agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 54, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of Cadent to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and, the facilities and rights referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of Cadent and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Cadent advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Cadent reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to Cadent to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 56(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for Cadent to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
56.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 63 (arbitration) and the arbitrator may make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of Cadent
57.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to Cadent a plan and, if reasonably required by Cadent, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc.;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any specified works until Cadent has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of Cadent under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (5) or (7); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and Cadent must meaningfully engage with the undertaker within 28 days of the date of submission of the plan under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Specified works must only be executed in accordance with—
(a)
the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent; and
(b)
all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and Cadent is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If Cadent, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 49 to 51 and 54 to 56 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 55(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised works—
(a)
the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme; and
(b)
Cadent retains the right to carry out further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in accordance with paragraph 58.
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(12) In this paragraph “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to, or to prevent the occurrence of, circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works reasonably believes to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.
Expenses

the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule; and
(g)
any watching brief pursuant to paragraph 57(6).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 63 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances (or it would be unlawful due to a statutory or regulatory change) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs must be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
59.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by the undertaker) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from Cadent, the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs properly incurred by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Cadent becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief does not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any part of the authorised development carried out by Cadent in the exercise of any functions conferred by this Order pursuant to a grant or transfer under article 10 (consent to transfer benefit of Order); and
(c)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party arising from any such damage or interruption, which is not reasonably foreseeable.
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering its representations.
(5) Cadent must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker Cadent must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised.
Enactments and agreements
60.  Except where this Part of this Schedule provides otherwise, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Cadent in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
61.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or Cadent requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 55(2) or Cadent makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 57, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised works and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Cadent’s undertaking and Cadent must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) Whenever Cadent’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted to Cadent or the taking of action by Cadent, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
62.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 54(1) or the powers conferred by this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable Cadent to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
63.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 55(2) and 55(4) any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and Cadent under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Cadent, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
Notices
64.  Notwithstanding article 47 (service of notices) any plans submitted to Cadent by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 57(1) must be sent via email to Cadent Gas Limited Plant Protection at plantprotection@cadentgas.com as well as via post to Plant Protection, Cadent Gas Limited, Brick Kiln Street, Hinckley, Leicestershire, LE10 0NA, or such other address as Cadent may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker in writing.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations authorise the placing on the market of specified genetically modified food and feed products in England. They also modify the terms of existing authorisations.
Part 2 and Schedules 1 to 8 contain the authorisations, in relation to England, of products containing, and consisting of, or produced from the specified genetically modified organisms, in accordance with Articles 7(3) and 19(3) of Regulation (EC) No. 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on genetically modified food and feed (“Regulation 1829/2003”) as follows—
(a)
Schedule 1 is a new authorisation for genetically modified soybean DAS-81419-2 × DAS-44406-6;
(b)
Schedule 2 is a new authorisation for genetically modified soybean DAS-81419-2;
(c)
Schedule 3 is a new authorisation for genetically modified soybean SYHT0H2;
(d)
Schedule 4 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 87427 × MON 87460 × MON 89034 × 1507 × MON 87411 × 59122 and its sub-combinations;
(e)
Schedule 5 is a new authorisation for genetically modified maize 1507 × MIR162 × MON 810 × NK603 and its sub-combinations;
(f)
Schedule 6 is a new authorisation for genetically modified cotton GHB614 × T304-40 × GHB119;
(g)
Schedule 7 renews the authorisation for genetically modified maize MON 88017 × MON 810;
(h)
Schedule 8 renews the authorisation for genetically modified oilseed rape GT73. This renewal is limited to products containing or consisting of genetically modified oilseed rape GT73 (other than food). It does not cover products “produced from” that genetically modified organism.
Authorisations granted by these Regulations are valid for a period of ten years in accordance with Articles 7(4) and 19(4) of Regulation 1829/2003 and will expire at the end of 25th April 2033. This is subject to Articles 11(4) and 23(4) of that Regulation, which provide for an extension of the authorisation period in certain circumstances where an application for renewal has been submitted.
Part 3 amends, in relation to England, 18 retained EU Decisions containing existing authorisations for genetically modified food and feed. The amendments all relate to changes to the names and addresses of the respective authorisation holders, and their representatives in Great Britain.
Part 4 revokes, in relation to England, the retained EU Decision containing the previous authorisation for the products now authorised by Schedule 7.
In each Schedule, paragraph 4 specifies the methods for detection, including sampling, which have been validated for use in relation to the authorised products. The documents referred to have been published at http://gmo-crl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/statusofdossiers.aspx. Hard copies of these documents are available for inspection at the Food Standards Agency, Floors 6 and 7, Clive House, 70 Petty France, London SW1H 9EX, at reasonable times, following a written request to that address or to GM.Inquiries@food.gov.uk.
Information on the authorisation of the products will be entered in the register of genetically modified food and feed referred to in Article 28(1) of Regulation 1829/2003.
The authorisations made by this instrument will be notified through the Biosafety Clearing-House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(1)(e) of Regulation (EC) No. 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms.
Further information, including in relation to the register, or the information notified pursuant to the Cartagena Protocol, can be obtained from the Food Standards Agency, Floors 6 and 7, Clive House, 70 Petty France, London SW1H 9EX or by writing to GM.Inquiries@food.gov.uk.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

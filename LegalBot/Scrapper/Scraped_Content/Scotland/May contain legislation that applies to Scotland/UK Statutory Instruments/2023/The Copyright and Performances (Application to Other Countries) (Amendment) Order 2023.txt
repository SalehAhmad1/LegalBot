Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Part 1 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (“the Act”) confers the protection of copyright on the creators of certain works (“Part 1 protections”). It applies to works originating from certain countries and is applied by the Copyright and Performances (Application to Other Countries) Order 2016 (“the 2016 Order”), made under powers conferred by the Act, to works originating from certain other countries. Part 2 of the Act confers the protection of rights on performers and persons having recording rights in relation to a performance (“Part 2 protections”). It applies to performances connected with certain countries and is also applied by the 2016 Order to performances connected with certain other countries.
This Order amends the 2016 Order as follows. Article 2(2) amends article 8 of the 2016 Order to provide for the application of Part 1 protections to wired broadcasts relating to Australia and both wired and wireless broadcasts relating to New Zealand. Article 2(3) amends the list in the 2016 Order of countries which are not parties to the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations but have become parties to the World Intellectual Property Organisation Performance and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) to which certain Part 2 protections apply in accordance with article 11 of the 2016 Order. This change reflects the recent accession of Uganda to the WPPT.

“claim for remission” means a claim in respect of goods, made in accordance with Section 2, that a liability to duty incurred in respect of those goods be remitted;
“claim for repayment or remission” is to be read in accordance with these definitions;
“claimant” means a person who makes a claim for repayment or remission;
“eligibility criteria” means criteria described in the repayment and remission reference document which must be met in relation to a claim for repayment or remission;
“principal” has the meaning given in regulation 16U;
“remitted” means the discharge of a liability to duty, or part of that liability;
“repayment and remission agent” has the meaning given in regulation 16U;
“repayment and remission reference document” means the document entitled “Duty incurred in Northern Ireland – repayment and remission on production of evidence: eligibility criteria and other conditions”, version 1.0 dated 6th June 2023(3) which—
(a)
describes the eligibility criteria which apply for the purposes of a claim for repayment or remission; and
(b)
describes cases expressed by reference to classes of goods in relation to which a claim for repayment or remission may be made.
Repayment and remission agents
16U.—(1) A person (a “principal”) may appoint any other person (a “repayment and remission agent”) to act on the principal’s behalf for the purposes of this Chapter.

(3) A repayment and remission agent must disclose their appointment to HMRC in each claim for repayment or remission which is made as agent on behalf of a principal.

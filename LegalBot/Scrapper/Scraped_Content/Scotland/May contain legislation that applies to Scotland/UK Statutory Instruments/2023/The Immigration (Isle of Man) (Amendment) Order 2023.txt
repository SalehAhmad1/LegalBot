Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Immigration (Isle of Man) Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/680) so as to reflect the transfer of functions under the Immigration Acts from the Minister for the Cabinet Office to the Minister for the Treasury (the Cabinet Office and the Treasury both being Departments of the Isle of Man Government) and makes transitional and saving provisions. It also provides that the Minister for the Treasury may authorise others to exercise functions of the Minister under the Immigration Acts. This is required to avoid doubt in relation to the application of the Carltona principle in the Isle of Man where the Government Departments Act 1987(1) (an Act of Tynwald) makes specific provision about the ability of Ministers to authorise others to exercise Departmental functions.

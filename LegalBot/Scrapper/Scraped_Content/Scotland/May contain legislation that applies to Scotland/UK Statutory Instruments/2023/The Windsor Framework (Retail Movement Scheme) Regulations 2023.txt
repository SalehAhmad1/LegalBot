(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations establish the Retail Movement Scheme. This Scheme implements the Windsor Framework(1) and is intended to regulate the movement of certain consignments of retail goods from Great Britain into Northern Ireland and what checks are to be made in respect of those goods.
Part 2 prescribes how a person may apply to the Secretary of State for approval to move goods to which the Scheme applies into Northern Ireland. It also makes provision enabling persons to add or remove listed establishments and also prescribes processes for reviews and appeals where a person’s application has been refused, where their approval to move goods has been suspended or cancelled or their approval to list an establishment has been refused.
Part 3 prescribes the nature and extent of checks which are to be made on those retail goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland under the Scheme and prescribes when those checks are to be made. It also prescribes when those checks may be made where authorities have a discretion to conduct those checks. It also prescribes the locations where those checks are to be made.
Part 4 makes provision about rights of entry both to enforce the Regulations and to make checks. It also makes provision about seizure, re-export and destruction of goods posing a relevant potential risk.

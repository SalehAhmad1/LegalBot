(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations authorise the placing on the market of specific feed additives in England.
Regulation 3 and Schedules 1 – 13 contain the following authorisations—
Schedule 1 renews the authorisation of a preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) produced from Trichoderma reesei (CBS 143953) (identification number 4a11) and authorises it for a new use to be used in feed by extending to all poultry species and to suckling piglets and minor porcine species;
Schedule 2 authorises a new preparation of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (IMI 507023) (identification number 1k21701);
Schedule 3 authorises a new preparation of Pediococcus pentosaceus (IMI 507024) (identification number 1k21016);
Schedule 4 authorises a new preparation of Pediococcus pentosaceus (IMI 507025) (identification number 1k21017);
Schedule 5 authorises a new preparation of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (IMI 507026) (identification number 1k21601);
Schedule 6 authorises a new preparation of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (IMI 507027) (identification number 1k21602);
Schedule 7 authorises a new preparation of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (IMI 507028) (identification number 1k21603);
Schedule 8 authorises a new preparation of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (DSM 26571) (identification number 1k1604);
Schedule 9 renews the authorisation for a preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) produced from Trichoderma reesei (CBS 114044) (identification number 4a8i);
Schedule 10 renews the authorisation for a preparation of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced from Trichoderma reesei (CBS 122001) (identification number 4a12);
Schedule 11 authorises a new feed additive L‐lysine base produced from Corynebacterium glutamicum (KCCM 80216 or KCTC 12307BP) (identification number 3c326);
Schedule 12 authorises a new feed additive L‐lysine monohydrochloride produced from Corynebacterium glutamicum (KCCM 80216 or KCTC 12307BP) (identification number 3c327);
Schedule 13 authorises a new preparation of 3-nitrooxypropanol (identification number 4c1).
Authorisations granted by these Regulations are valid for a period of ten years in accordance with Article 9(7) of Regulation (EC) 1831/2003. This is subject to Article 14(4) of that Regulation, which provides for an extension of the authorisation period in certain circumstances where an application for renewal has been submitted.
Regulation 4 amends Regulation (EU) No.601/2013 by removing authorisation of cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate, cobalt(II) carbonate, cobalt(II) carbonate hydroxide (2:3) monohydrate and cobalt(II) sulphate heptahydrate. These feed additives have been provisionally authorised by the Feed Additives (Form of Provisional Authorisations) (Cobalt(II) Compounds) (England) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/689).
Regulation 5 revokes minor amendment provisions relating to instruments that are revoked by regulation 7 and Schedule 14.
Regulation 6 is a transitional provision that enables the continued production and labelling of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) produced from Trichoderma reesei (CBS 114044), for limited periods, under the conditions of its previous authorisation. Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) is now authorised under Schedule 9.
Regulation 7 and Schedule 14 revoke, in relation to England, retained EU Regulations that contain previous authorisations for feed additives now authorised by Schedules 1, 9 and 10.
Hard copies of the documents in the Schedules are available for inspection at the Food Standards Agency, Food House, Kings Pool, 1-2 Peasholme Green, York YO1 7PR following a written request to that address or to FeedAdditives@food.gov.uk.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

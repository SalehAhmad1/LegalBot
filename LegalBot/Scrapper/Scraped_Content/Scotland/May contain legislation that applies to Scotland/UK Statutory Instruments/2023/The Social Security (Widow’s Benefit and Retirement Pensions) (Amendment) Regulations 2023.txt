Department for Work and PensionsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 10 of the Social Security (Widow’s Benefit and Retirement Pensions) Regulations 1979 (S.I. 1979/642), which sets out the conditions that a person must meet to be entitled to a Category D retirement pension. One of those conditions is a condition of residence in Great Britain on the person’s 80th birthday or the date of claim, if later.
Regulation 10 is amended so that the condition of residence on that date does not apply if the person is resident in an EEA State or Switzerland, and one of the provisions listed in new paragraph (2) applies to them. Those provisions prevent a person being refused entitlement to a benefit solely on the basis that they are not resident in Great Britain.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

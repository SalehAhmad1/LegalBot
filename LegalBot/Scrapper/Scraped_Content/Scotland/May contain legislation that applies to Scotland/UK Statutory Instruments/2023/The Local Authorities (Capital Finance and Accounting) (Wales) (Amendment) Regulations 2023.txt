18 April 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Local Authorities (Capital Finance and Accounting) (Wales) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”).
Regulation 24K of the 2003 Regulations provides that a local authority must not charge an amount to its revenue account to reflect any fluctuation in the fair value of a local authority’s investment in a pooled investment fund. Instead, such amounts must be recorded in a separate account established and used solely for that purpose. These Regulations extend the application of regulation 24K by an additional two financial years to 31 March 2025.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

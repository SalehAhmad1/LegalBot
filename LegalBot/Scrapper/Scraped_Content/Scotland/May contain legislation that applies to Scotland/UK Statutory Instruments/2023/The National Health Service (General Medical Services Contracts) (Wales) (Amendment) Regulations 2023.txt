18 December 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) (Wales) Regulations 2023(1) (“the principal Regulations”). Those regulations set out, for Wales, the framework for general medical services contracts under section 42 of the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006(2).
These Regulations make amendments to the principal Regulations to correct errors of a technical nature and insert new definitions.
In consequence of the corrections made to the principal Regulations, these Regulations also amend the National Health Service (Performers Lists) (Wales) Regulations 2004(3) and the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) (Wales) Regulations 2020(4).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

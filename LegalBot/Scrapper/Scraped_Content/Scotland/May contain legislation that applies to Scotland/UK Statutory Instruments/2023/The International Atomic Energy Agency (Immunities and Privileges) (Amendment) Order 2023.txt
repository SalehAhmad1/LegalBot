(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the International Atomic Energy Agency (Immunities and Privileges) Order 1974 (S.I. 1974/1256) (“the IAEA Order”).
The IAEA Order implements the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Atomic Energy Agency (“the IAEA”) (Cmnd. 1675), approved by the Board of Governors of the IAEA on 1st July 1959 (“the Agreement”).
Article 2 of this Order amends the IAEA Order by inserting a new article 3A. In light of the devolution settlement reached under the Scotland Act 1998, some provisions of the IAEA Order do not extend to, or apply in, Scotland and as such do not apply to Scotland insofar as they are within its devolved competence.
Article 2(2) of this Order amends article 14 of the IAEA Order to firstly ensure that representatives of members benefit from the privileges and immunities conferred by the Agreement when attending meetings of any international conference, symposium, seminar or panel convened by the IAEA.
Secondly, the definition of representatives of members in Article 1, section 1(iii) of the Agreement is inserted.
This Order will enable His Majesty’s Government to give effect to its obligations under the Agreement relating to privileges and immunities.

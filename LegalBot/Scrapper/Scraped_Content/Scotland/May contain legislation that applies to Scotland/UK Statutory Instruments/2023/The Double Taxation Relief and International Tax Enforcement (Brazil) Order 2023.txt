If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.
2.  Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment.
3.  In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, in accordance with the provisions of and subject to the limitations of the taxation laws of the Contracting State concerned.

(b)
profits from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) used for the transport of goods or merchandise;

3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency.
ARTICLE 9
Associated Enterprises
1.  Where:
(a)
an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or
(b)
the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State,
and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly.
2.  Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly – profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and, in any case, any such adjustment shall be made only in accordance with the mutual agreement procedure in Article 27 of the Convention.

2.  However, dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State may also be taxed in that State according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State:
(a)
the tax so charged shall not exceed:
(i)
10 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company which holds directly at least 10 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends throughout a 365 day period that includes the day of the payment of the dividend (for the purpose of computing that period, no account shall be taken of changes of ownership that would directly result from a corporate reorganisation, such as a merger or divisive reorganisation, of the company that holds the shares or that pays the dividend); or
(ii)
15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases;
(b)
notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph a), the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends where those dividends are paid out of income (including gains) derived directly or indirectly from immovable property within the meaning of Article 6 by an investment vehicle which distributes most of this income annually and whose income from such immovable property is exempted from tax;
(c)
notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraphs a) and b), the dividends shall be exempt from tax in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a pension scheme established in the other Contracting State.
This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid.
3.  The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as any other item which is treated as income from shares by the taxation laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident.
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.
5.  Where a resident of a Contracting State has a permanent establishment in the other Contracting State, that permanent establishment may be subject to a tax withheld at source in accordance with the law of that other Contracting State. However, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the profits of that permanent establishment determined after the payment of the corporate tax related to such profits.
6.  Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in that other State.
ARTICLE 11
Interest
1.  Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.
2.  However, interest arising in a Contracting State may also be taxed in that State according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State:
(a)
the tax so charged shall not exceed:
(i)
7 per cent on the gross amount of the interest paid to a bank or insurance company on a loan of at least five years for the financing of infrastructure projects and public utilities;

(B) bonds or securities that are regularly and substantially traded on a recognized stock exchange within the meaning of sub-paragraph a) of paragraph 6 of Article 29;
(C) a sale on credit paid by the purchaser of machinery and equipment to the seller of the machinery and equipment;
(iii)
15 per cent of the gross amount of the interest in all other cases.
(b)
notwithstanding the provisions of sub-paragraph a), the interest shall be exempt from tax in the Contracting State of which the company paying the interest is a resident if the beneficial owner of the interest is a pension scheme established in the other Contracting State, the Government of the other Contracting State, a political subdivision thereof or any agency (including a financial institution) wholly owned by that Government or a political subdivision thereof.
3.  The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as other income which is treated as income from money lent by the tax law of the Contracting State in which the income arises. The term shall not include any item which is treated as a dividend under the provisions of Article 10.
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.
5.  Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
6.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.
ARTICLE 12
Royalties
1.  Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.
2.  However, royalties arising in a Contracting State may also be taxed in that State according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties.
3.  The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work, including cinematograph films and recordings for television or radio broadcasting, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial, or scientific equipment, or for information (know-how) concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience.
4.  The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 15, as the case may be, shall apply.
5.  Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.
6.  Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties paid exceeds, for whatever reason, the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount.

ARTICLE 25
Elimination of Double Taxation
1.  In Brazil, double taxation shall be avoided as follows:
(a)
Where a resident of Brazil derives income which, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, may be taxed in the United Kingdom, Brazil shall allow, subject to the provisions of its law regarding the elimination of double taxation (which shall not affect the general principle hereof), as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident, an amount equal to the United Kingdom tax paid in the United Kingdom. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the income tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is attributable to the income which may be taxed in the United Kingdom.
(b)
Where in accordance with any provision of this Convention income derived by a resident of Brazil is exempt from tax in Brazil, Brazil may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income of such resident, take into account the exempted income.
2.  Subject to the provisions of the law of the United Kingdom regarding the allowance as a credit against United Kingdom tax of tax payable in a territory outside the United Kingdom or, as the case may be, regarding the exemption from United Kingdom tax of a dividend arising in a territory outside the United Kingdom or of the profits of a permanent establishment situated in a territory outside the United Kingdom (which shall not affect the general principle hereof):
(a)
Brazilian tax payable under the laws of Brazil and in accordance with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, on profits, income or chargeable gains from sources within Brazil (excluding in the case of a dividend tax payable in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against any United Kingdom tax computed by reference to the same profits, income or chargeable gains by reference to which the Brazilian tax is computed;
(b)
a dividend which is paid by a company which is a resident of Brazil to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;
(c)
the profits of a permanent establishment in Brazil of a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom shall be exempted from United Kingdom tax when the exemption is applicable and the conditions for exemption under the law of the United Kingdom are met;
(d)
in the case of a dividend not exempted from tax under sub-paragraph b) above which is paid by a company which is a resident of Brazil to a company which is a resident of the United Kingdom and which controls directly or indirectly at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividend, the credit mentioned in sub-paragraph a) above shall also take into account the Brazilian tax payable by the company in respect of its profits out of which such dividend is paid.
For the purposes of this paragraph, profits, income and gains owned by a resident of the United Kingdom which may be taxed in Brazil in accordance with this Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in Brazil.
3.  The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply where the United Kingdom tax payable is in accordance with the provisions of this Convention solely because the income referred to in that paragraph is also income, profits or chargeable gains derived by a resident of the United Kingdom.
4.  The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not apply where the Brazilian tax payable is in accordance with the provisions of this Convention solely because the income, profits or chargeable gains referred to in that paragraph is also income derived by a resident of Brazil.
5.  Where under any provision of this Convention income or gains are relieved from tax in a Contracting State and, under the law in force in the other Contracting State, a person, in respect of that income or those gains, is subject to tax by reference to the amount thereof which is remitted to or received in that other State and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then the relief to be allowed under this Convention in the first-mentioned State shall apply only to so much of the income or gains as is taxed in the other State.
6.  Where a resident of a Contracting State is not a qualified person, as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 29, nor entitled to benefits under this Convention under paragraph 3 or 4 of Article 29, and such resident is not granted benefits by the competent authority of that Contracting State under paragraph 5 of Article 29, no credit for tax paid in the other Contracting State shall be allowed to such resident in the first-mentioned State.
ARTICLE 26
Non-discrimination
1.  Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected.
2.  The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities.
3.  Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 6 of Article 11, paragraph 6 of Article 12, paragraph 7 of Article 13 or paragraph 4 of Article 23 apply, interest, royalties, fees for technical services and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State.
4.  Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State are or may be subjected.
5.  The provisions of this Article shall apply only to the taxes covered by this Convention.
6.  Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed as obliging either Contracting State to grant to individuals not resident in that State any of the personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for tax purposes which are granted to individuals so resident or to its nationals.
ARTICLE 27
Mutual Agreement Procedure
1.  Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for him in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, he may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present his case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which he is a resident. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Convention.
2.  The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Convention. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States.
3.  The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Convention. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Convention.

The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2.
2.  Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use.
3.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation:
(a)
to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State;
(b)
to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State;
(c)
to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public).
4.  If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information.
5.  In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person.
ARTICLE 29
Entitlement to Benefits
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, a resident of a Contracting State shall not be entitled to a benefit that would otherwise be accorded by this Convention (other than a benefit under paragraph 3 of Article 4, paragraph 2 of Article 9 or Article 27) unless such resident is a “qualified person”, as defined in paragraph 2, at the time that the benefit would be accorded.
(2) A resident of a Contracting State shall be a qualified person at a time when a benefit would otherwise be accorded by the Convention if, at that time, the resident is:

(3) (a) A resident of a Contracting State shall be entitled to benefits under this Convention with respect to an item of income derived from the other Contracting State, regardless of whether the resident is a qualified person, if the resident is engaged in the active conduct of a business in the first-mentioned State and the income derived from the other State emanates from, or is incidental to, that business.
(b)
If a resident of a Contracting State derives an item of income from a business activity conducted by that resident in the other Contracting State, or derives an item of income arising in the other State from a connected person, the conditions described in subparagraph a) shall be considered to be satisfied with respect to such item only if the business activity carried on by the resident in the first-mentioned State to which the item is related is substantial in relation to the same or complementary business activity carried on by the resident or such connected person in the other Contracting State. Whether a business activity is substantial for the purposes of this paragraph shall be determined based on all the facts and circumstances.
(c)
For purposes of applying this paragraph, activities conducted by connected persons with respect to a resident of a Contracting State shall be deemed to be conducted by such resident.

(i)

(4) A resident of a Contracting State that is not a qualified person shall nevertheless be entitled to a benefit that would otherwise be accorded by this Convention with respect to an item of income if, at the time when the benefit otherwise would be accorded and on at least half of the days of any twelve-month period that includes that time, persons that are equivalent beneficiaries own, directly or indirectly, at least 75 per cent of the shares of the resident.
(5) If a resident of a Contracting State is neither a qualified person pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, nor entitled to benefits under paragraph 3 or 4, the competent authority of the Contracting State in which benefits are denied under the previous provisions of this Article may, nevertheless, grant the benefits of this Convention, or benefits with respect to a specific item of income, taking into account the object and purpose of this Convention, but only if such resident demonstrates to the satisfaction of such competent authority that neither its establishment, acquisition or maintenance, nor the conduct of its operations, had as one of its principal purposes the obtaining of benefits under this Convention. The competent authority of the Contracting State to which a request has been made, under this paragraph, by a resident of the other State, shall consult with the competent authority of that other State before either granting or denying the request.

(a)
the term “recognised stock exchange” means:
(i)
the B3 S.A. and any other Brazilian stock exchange recognised under Brazilian law;

(c)
the term “principal class of shares” means the class or classes of shares of a company or entity which represents the majority of the aggregate vote and value of the company or entity;
(d)
two persons shall be “connected persons” if one owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares) or another person owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50 per cent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, at least 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares) in each person. In any case, a person shall be connected to another if, based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same person or persons;
(e)
the term “equivalent beneficiary” means any person who would be entitled to benefits with respect to an item of income accorded by a Contracting State under the domestic law of that Contracting State, this Convention or a relevant double taxation agreement of that State which are equivalent to, or more favourable than, benefits to be accorded to that item of income under this Convention. For the purposes of determining whether a person is an equivalent beneficiary with respect to dividends received by a company, the person shall be deemed to be a company and to hold the same capital of the company paying the dividends as such capital the company claiming the benefit with respect to the dividends holds.
(7) The competent authorities of the Contracting States may by mutual agreement settle the mode of application of this Article.
(8) Where an enterprise of a Contracting State derives income from the other Contracting State and the first-mentioned Contracting State treats that income as profits attributable to a permanent establishment situated in a third jurisdiction, the benefits of this Convention shall not apply to that income if that income is subject to a combined aggregate effective rate of tax in the first-mentioned Contracting State and the jurisdiction in which the permanent establishment is situated that is less than the general statutory rate of company tax applicable in the first-mentioned Contracting State. If benefits under this Convention are denied pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to an item of income derived by a resident of a Contracting State, the competent authority of the other Contracting State may, nevertheless, grant these benefits with respect to that item of income if, in response to a request by such resident, such competent authority determines that granting such benefits is justified in light of the reasons such resident did not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (such as the existence of losses). The competent authority of the Contracting State to which a request has been made under the preceding sentence shall consult with the competent authority of the other Contracting State before either granting or denying the request.
(9) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Convention, a benefit under this Convention shall not be granted in respect of an item of income or a capital gain if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Convention.
(10) Where a benefit under this Convention is denied to a person under paragraph 9, the competent authority of the Contracting State that would otherwise have granted this benefit shall nevertheless treat that person as being entitled to this benefit, or to different benefits with respect to a specific item of income or a capital gain, if such competent authority, upon request from that person and after consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, determines that such benefits would have been granted to that person in the absence of the transaction or arrangement referred to in paragraph 9. The competent authority of the Contracting State to which the request has been made will consult with the competent authority of the other State before rejecting a request made under this paragraph by a resident of that other State.

PROTOCOL
At the moment of the signature of the Convention between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Federative Republic of Brazil for the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance, the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, have agreed upon the following provisions which constitute an integral part of the Convention.
1.  With reference to the Convention
In accordance with the Commentary to Article 1 of the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries on “Improper use of tax treaties” (as it may be revised from time to time), it is understood that this Convention shall not be interpreted to mean that a Contracting State is prevented from applying its domestic legal provisions on the prevention of tax evasion or tax avoidance, including provisions of its tax law regarding “thin capitalization” or to avoid the deferral of payment of the income tax such as the “controlled foreign corporations/CFCs” legislation.
2.  With reference to Article 3
It is understood, with reference to subparagraphs a) and b) of paragraph 1 of Article 3, nothing in this Convention shall prejudice the position of either Contracting State with regard to any issues concerning territorial sovereignty, sovereignty over maritime areas or any other issues concerning the law of the sea, including the compatibility of that position with international law.
3.  With reference to Article 9
It is understood that the adjustment referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 9 will be made only if the other Contracting State agrees, both in principle and as regard the amount, to the adjustment made by the first-mentioned Contracting State.
4.  With reference to Articles 10, 11 and 12
If, after the date of signature of this Convention, Brazil agrees, in a convention with any other State, to rates that are lower (including any exemption) than the ones provided in Articles 10, 11 and 12, the Contracting States shall consult with each other to consider whether to update this Convention. The competent authority of Brazil shall notify the competent authority of the United Kingdom of any such new convention as soon as reasonably practicable after the rate has been agreed.
5.  With reference to Article 11
(a)
It is understood that “interest on the company’s equity” (“juros sobre o capital próprio” in Portuguese) paid in accordance with the Brazilian law is considered interest for the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article 11.
(b)
It is understood that the provisions of sub-paragraph b) of paragraph 2 of Article 11 shall apply to interest paid to an agency (including a financial institution) wholly owned by the Government of a Contracting State or by a political subdivision thereof only when such interest is received by the agency in connection with its functions of public nature.
6.  With reference to Article 12
It is understood that, in the case of Brazil, in classifying as royalties payments received as consideration for information (know-how) concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience, the scope of information of an industrial, commercial or scientific nature is not limited to that arising exclusively from previous experience.
7.  With reference to Article 13
If, after the date of signature of this Convention, Brazil agrees, in a Convention with any other State which is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), excluding any State in Latin America, to rates that are lower (including any exemption) than the ones provided in paragraph 2 of Article 13, then such rates shall, for the purposes of this Convention, automatically be applicable under the same terms, from the time and for as long as such rates are applicable in that other Convention.
8.  With reference to Article 17
It is understood that, in the case of Brazil, the provisions of Article 17 apply also to members of the administrative and fiscal councils.
9.  With reference to Article 26
(a)
It is understood that the provisions of paragraph 5 of Article 10 are not in conflict with the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 26.
(b)
It is understood that the provisions of the Brazilian tax law which do not allow that royalties as defined in paragraph 3 of Article 12, paid by a permanent establishment situated in Brazil to a resident of the United Kingdom that carries on business in Brazil through such a permanent establishment, be deductible at the moment of the determination of the taxable income of the above referred permanent establishment, are not in conflict with the provisions of Article 26 of the present Convention.
(c)
With reference to paragraph 6 of Article 26, it is understood that, notwithstanding the fact that United Kingdom nationals are entitled to United Kingdom personal allowances whether they are resident in the United Kingdom or in Brazil, United Kingdom personal allowances are not available to Brazilian nationals who are not resident in the United Kingdom. However, Brazilian nationals who are resident in the United Kingdom are entitled to United Kingdom personal allowances.
10.  With reference to Article 27
For purposes of paragraph 3 of Article XXII (Consultation) of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the Contracting States agree that, notwithstanding that paragraph, any dispute between them as to whether a measure falls within the scope of this Convention may be brought before the Council for Trade in Services, as provided by that paragraph, only with the consent of both Contracting States. Any doubt as to the interpretation of this paragraph shall be resolved under paragraph 3 of Article 27 or, failing agreement under that procedure, pursuant to any other procedure agreed to by both Contracting States.
11.  With reference to Article 28
(a)
It is understood that, in relation to the requests presented by Brazil, the taxes referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 28 mean federal taxes only.
(b)
The Contracting States affirm their commitment to spontaneously exchange information which they consider to be of interest to the other State.
12.  With reference to Article 29
(a)
In relation to the activities listed in sub-paragraph d) of paragraph 3 of Article 29, the following non-exhaustive list of factors is to be considered, together with the location of the shareholders, activities and assets, in order to determine whether the resident is engaged in the active conduct of a business for the purpose of sub-paragraph a). It is understood that not all factors may be present in every business, and a comprehensive analysis of the listed factors present in a business is to be carried out to determine if there is an active conduct of a business:
(i)
Whether at least half of the statutory board members of the company with powers to decide (key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the entity’s business as a whole) are resident in the State of residency of the company and whether they have equal decision-making powers to the non-resident board members. Members of the supervisory board are not required to be considered;
(ii)
Whether the board members resident in the State of residence of the company have sufficient knowledge and the capacity to perform their tasks, including making decisions on transactions and managing the completion of transactions;
(iii)
Whether the company has qualified staff to manage and register the transactions in its residence State. For this purpose, the staff should be able to conduct the day-to-day activities necessary for preparing and making those decisions in that State;
(iv)
Whether the decisions by the board meetings of the company are made by persons physically present in that State. The board meetings are not held in another jurisdiction or held electronically outside the residence State (video conferencing or over the phone). During the board meetings the key management and commercial decisions that are necessary for the conduct of the entity’s business are in substance and with independency being made;
(v)
Whether the most important bank accounts are held in the company’s residence State and the company has the decision-making power and the entitlement to the account;
(vi)
Whether the company has an office space in the residence State that is used and has been properly equipped for a period of at least 24 months;
(vii)
Whether the company has appropriate equity with regard to the risks inherent in its activities.
(b)
It is understood that the benefits granted by a competent authority of a Contracting State under paragraph 5 of Article 29 are the benefits available in that State and that paragraph 5 does not oblige the other Contracting State to grant any benefits.
(c)
It is understood that, for the purpose of subparagraph e) of paragraph 6 of Article 29, a relevant double taxation agreement is an agreement that would be applicable between the Contracting State in which the item of income arises and the State of residence of the equivalent beneficiary if the equivalent beneficiary had received the relevant item of income directly.
In witness whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, have signed this Protocol.

Melanie Hopkins Júlio César Vieira GomesEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order gives effect to two arrangements between the United Kingdom and the Federative Republic of Brazil which are made with a view to affording relief from double taxation.
In this Order, article 1 provides for citation. Article 2 makes declarations as to the effect and content of the arrangements set out in Schedules 1 and 2. Article 3 revokes the Double Taxation Relief (Shipping and Air Transport Profits) (Brazil) Order 1968 (S.I. 1968/572) and makes transitional arrangements relating to it.
Schedule 1 to this Order contains an Agreement (“the 2005 Arrangements”) between the United Kingdom and the Federative Republic of Brazil in relation to the elimination of double taxation with respect to taxes on income or profits derived from shipping and air transport.
The 2005 Arrangements aim to eliminate the double taxation of income derived from shipping and air transport. This is done by allocating the taxing rights that each country has under its domestic law over the same income solely to the country of the undertaking.
The 2005 Arrangements take effect retrospectively, from 1 January 1967, in accordance with Article 4 of those arrangements. The 2005 Arrangements are to be suspended once the arrangements set out in Schedule 2 take effect, in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 31 of the Convention.
Schedule 2 to this Order contains a Convention and Protocol (“the 2022 Arrangements”) between the United Kingdom and the Federative Republic of Brazil in relation to the elimination of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital, the prevention of tax evasion and avoidance, and assisting international tax enforcement.
The 2022 Arrangements, in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 31 of the Convention, suspend the agreements mentioned in that paragraph, in relation to taxes with effect on and after the date the 2022 Arrangements take effect, between the United Kingdom and the Federative Republic of Brazil signed at Brasilia on 27 July 2005 and at Brasilia on 2 September 2010.
The 2022 Arrangements aim to eliminate the double taxation of income and gains arising in one country and paid to residents of the other country. This is done by allocating the taxing rights that each country has under its domestic law over the same income and gains, and by providing relief from double taxation. There are also specific measures which combat discriminatory tax treatment and provide for assistance in international tax enforcement.
The 2022 Arrangements will enter into force on the date of the later of the notifications by each country of the completion of its legislative procedures and will take effect in each territory in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 31 of the Convention.
The date of entry into force of the 2022 Arrangements will, in due course, be published in the London, Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been produced for the Order as it gives effect to double taxation agreements. Double taxation agreements impose no obligations on taxpayers, rather they seek to eliminate double taxation and fiscal evasion.

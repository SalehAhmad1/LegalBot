University of London Act 2018
2018 CHAPTER iii
An Act to make new provision for the making of statutes for the University of London; and for related purposes.
[20th December 2018]
WHEREAS—
(1)
The University of London (“the University”) was first incorporated by Royal Charter granted on 28 November 1836 and is now incorporated by Royal Charter granted on 6 January 1863:
(2)
The provisions relating to the making of statutes for the University are set out in the University of London Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act”) and the statutes are now made by the Board of Trustees of the University:
(3)
The 1994 Act does not contemplate that the University educational, academic or research institutions may obtain university status in their own right:
(4)
The provisions of the 1994 Act would benefit from modernising in other respects:
(5)
It is therefore expedient that provision be made to modernise the process for making statutes for the University:
(6)
This Act does not amend the charter incorporating the University or any instrument of government of any constituent member of the University:
(7)
The purposes of this Act cannot be effected without the authority of Parliament:
(8)
The consent of the Charity Commission to the University defraying expenditure incurred in the preparation and promotion of the Bill for this Act, as required by section 74 of the Charities Act 2011, has been obtained:
May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted, by the Queen’s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:1

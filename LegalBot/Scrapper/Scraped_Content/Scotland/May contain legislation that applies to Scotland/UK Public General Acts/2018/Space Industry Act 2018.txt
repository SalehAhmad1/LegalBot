(b)
at the end of the existing text (which becomes subsection (1)) insert—
“(2)
This Act does not apply to activities carried on in the United Kingdom (and accordingly does not apply to activities requiring authorisation under section 3(1) of the Space Industry Act 2018).”
(4)
In this Act—
“space activity” means—
(a)
launching or procuring the launch or the return to earth of a space object or of an aircraft carrying a space object,
(b)
operating a space object, or
(c)
any activity in outer space;
“sub-orbital activity” means launching, procuring the launch of, operating or procuring the return to earth of—
(a)
a craft to which subsection (5) applies, or
(b)
an aircraft carrying such a craft,
but does not include space activity.
(5)
This subsection applies to—
(a)
a rocket or other craft that is capable of operating above the stratosphere;
(b)
a balloon that is capable of reaching the stratosphere carrying crew or passengers.

(5)
The power in subsection (4) is subject to any restrictions imposed by or under any enactment.

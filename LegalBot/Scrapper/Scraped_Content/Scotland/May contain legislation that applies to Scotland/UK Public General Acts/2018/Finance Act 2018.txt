the earnings are, in whole or part, charged to tax under the employment income Parts otherwise than by virtue of this Part,
and for this purpose it does not matter whether all or some only or none of the tax is paid (but see sections 554Z5 and 554Z11B).

For the purposes of subsection (5C), an arrangement is a “redirected-earnings arrangement” if it (wholly or partly) covers or relates to redirected earnings; and for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (5C) “redirected earnings” means—
(a)
the payment mentioned in subsection (5A)(a), or

any sum or other property which (directly or indirectly)—
(i)
represents, or

(5C)
The circumstances mentioned in subsection (5A)—
(a)
do not prevent a redirected-earnings arrangement being within subsection (1)(b), and

(i)
the relevant transaction, and the relevant step so far as related to the relevant transaction, or
(ii)
the relevant step, and the relevant transaction so far as related to the relevant step,
is the avoidance of? income tax, national insurance contributions, corporation tax or a charge to tax under section 455 of CTA 2010.

(b)
it is being provided to a person on A's behalf, or at A's direction or request, or
(c)

A's employment with B, or
(ii)

(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2) “loan” includes—
(a)
any form of credit, and

a payment that is purported to be made by way of a loan.
(4)
The following assets are within this subsection—
(a)
securities,
(b)
interests in securities, and

(5)
For the purposes of subsection (2)(f)—
(a)
references to making a sum of money or asset available are references to making it available in any way, however informal,
(b)
it does not matter if the relevant third person has no legal right to have the sum of money or asset used as mentioned, and
(c)
it does not matter if the sum of money or asset is not actually used as mentioned.
(6)
Subsections (7) and (8) apply, for the purposes of subsection (2)(g), for the purpose of determining the likely effective duration of a lease of any premises granted to a relevant third person (“the original lease”).
(7)
If there are circumstances which make it likely that the original lease will be extended for any period, the effective duration of the original lease is to be determined on the assumption that the original lease will be so extended.
(8)
Further, if—
(a)
the relevant third person, A or a person linked with A is, or is likely to become, entitled to a later lease, or the grant of a later lease, of the same premises, or

But the distribution or transaction is not an “excluded transaction” if the avoidance of tax is the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of (as the case may be)—
(a)
making the distribution, or
(b)
the transaction.
(3)
Part 23 of CTA 2010 has effect for determining the meaning of “distribution” in this section as if—
(a)
section 1000(1) of CTA 2010 included a paragraph specifying any distribution made in a winding up of the company, and

(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1) a person is not to be regarded as a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to act merely because the directors act on advice given by that person in a professional capacity.

the relevant step is within section 554C by virtue of subsection (1)(ab) of that section.
(3)
In section 554AA(1)(a) and (b) references to A include references to a person linked with A.

(a)
determining the amount of the equity and liabilities of the entity, as at the end of the chargeable period, under paragraph 15G(2), and
(b)
adjusting that amount in accordance with paragraph 15N.
Step 4 The amount of the non-UK allocated equity and liabilities attributable to the foreign permanent establishment is X% of C.

Step 7 For the purposes of Step 3 in paragraph 6(2) treat Y% of Z as long term equity and liabilities and the rest as short term liabilities.
15Z2

(3)
Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a capital payment (or a part of a capital payment) if—

as a beneficiary of the settlement (whether or not the settlor is otherwise a beneficiary of the settlement), and
(ii)
at the time it was received by the original recipient, and
(b)
was not received by the original recipient.
(3)
Where any tax is chargeable on the settlor as a result of subsection (2) and is paid, the settlor is entitled to recover the full amount of the tax from the original recipient.

(a)
the amount of tax paid, and

(b)
a slice (“U”) consisting of the untaxed part (if any) of each matched amount (if any), and
(c)
a slice (“R”) consisting of the rest (if any) of the original payment.
(2)
For the purposes of this section, if all or part of the original payment is, in a tax year (“the matching year”) not later than the gift year, matched under section 87A with the section 2(2) amount for the matching year or any earlier tax year, so much of the original payment as is so matched is a “matched amount”.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (1), if—
(a)
as a result of there being a matched amount, gains are treated by section 87 as accruing to the otherwise-liable person,
(b)
the otherwise-liable person is resident in the United Kingdom for the matching year, and
(c)
none of sections 809B, 809D and 809E of ITA 2007 applies to the otherwise-liable person for the matching year,
the whole of the matched amount is its “taxed part” (and it has no “untaxed part”).
(4)
For the purposes of subsection (1), if—
(a)
as a result of there being a matched amount, gains are treated by section 87 as accruing to the otherwise-liable person,

the whole or part of those gains is remitted to the United Kingdom in a tax year—
(i)
that is not later than the gift year, and
(ii)
in which the otherwise-liable person is resident in the United Kingdom,

(5)
For the purposes of subsection (1), if all or part of the original payment is in a tax year (“the pool-matching year”) not later than the gift year matched, under section 87A as applied by paragraph 8 of Schedule 4C, with the section 2(2) amount in the Schedule 4C pool for the pool-matching year or any earlier tax year—
(a)
so much of the original payment as is so matched is a “matched amount”, and
(b)
the whole of the matched amount is its “taxed part” (and it has no “untaxed part”).
87K
Attribution of gains or payments to recipient of onward gift
(1)
Where this section applies (see section 87I), G is—
(a)
the amount or value of so much of the onward payment as is within any of sub-paragraphs (i) to (iii) of section 87I(1)(d), or
(b)
if lower, the amount of the original payment.
(For the meaning of R and U, see section 87J.)
(2)
If R is greater than nil, sections 87 and 87A have effect for the gift year and later tax years—
(a)
as if a capital payment was received from the trustees by the subsequent recipient—
(i)
as a beneficiary of the settlement (whether or not the subsequent recipient is otherwise a beneficiary of the settlement), and
(ii)
at the time the subsequent recipient received the onward payment,
(b)
as if that capital payment consisted of—
(i)
R, if G is greater than R, or
(ii)
so much of R as is equal to G, if G is not greater than R, and
(c)
as if so much of the original payment as is equal to that capital payment was not received by the otherwise-liable person.
(3)
If G is greater than R, and if U is greater than nil—
(a)
chargeable gains are treated as accruing to the subsequent recipient in the gift year (but see section 87L(3) and (4)),
(b)
the amount of those gains is—
(i)
U, if (G − R) is greater than U, or
(ii)
so much of U as is equal to (G − R), if (G − R) is not greater than U, and
(c)
the chargeable gains treated by section 87 as accruing to the otherwise-liable person by reason of the original payment are treated as from the end of the gift year as reduced by that amount, with that reduction being made from so much of those gains as has not by then been remitted to the United Kingdom in a tax year in which the otherwise-liable person is resident in the United Kingdom.
(4)
If this section applies by reference to the original payment also in relation to a gift received from the original beneficiary in a tax year earlier than the gift year, this section applies in relation to the onward payment as if—
(a)
the amount given by section 87J for R were reduced by the amount of any capital payment given by subsection (2) in relation to that earlier year, and
(b)
the amount given by section 87J for U were reduced by the amount of any gains given by subsection (3) in relation to that earlier year.

(c)
the subsequent recipient is a close member of the settlor's family when the subsequent recipient receives the onward payment (see section 87I(1)(c)) by reference to which the chargeable gains are treated as accruing.
(4)
Section 87K(3)(a) has effect as if its reference to the subsequent recipient were a reference to the settlor, and references (however expressed) to chargeable gains treated as accruing by this section are to chargeable gains treated by section 87K(3)(a) as accruing to the settlor as a result of the operation of this subsection.
(5)
Where, in the case of a settlement, any tax is chargeable on the settlor as a result of this section and is paid, the settlor is entitled to recover the full amount of the tax from the person mentioned in subsection (1)(a) or (3)(a), as the case may be.

(a)
when the individual is not relevantly domiciled, and
(b)
in a tax year that is the current year or an earlier tax year.
If the individual is not the settlor, identify each benefit provided by the trustees to the individual at a time—

any part of it on which the individual is liable to income tax otherwise than under section 643A,
(b)
any income treated by section 643A, 643J or 643L as arising, to a person for a tax year earlier than the current year, by reference to any of the benefits identified in the individual's case at Step 1,

where the whole or part of a benefit identified in the individual's case at Step 1 is taken into account in charging income tax under Chapter 2 of Part 13 of ITA 2007, the amount or value of so much of the benefit as is taken into account in doing that, and
(d)
any amount required to be deducted by section 643D(2) (gains treated as accruing in a year before the current year).
Step 4 If the result of the calculation at Step 3 is an amount greater than nil, that amount is the individual's untaxed benefits total for the settlement for the current year.

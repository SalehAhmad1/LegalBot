(2)
There is implied in the lease a covenant by the lessor that the lessor will comply with all prescribed requirements that are applicable to that lease.
(3)
The Secretary of State must make regulations which require the lessor under a lease to which this section applies to take action, in relation to prescribed hazards which affect or may affect the leased dwelling, within the period or periods specified in the regulations.
(4)
Regulations under subsection (3) are enforceable against lessors only through actions for breach of the covenant that is implied by subsection (2).
(5)
In any proceedings for a breach of the covenant that is implied by subsection (2), it is a defence for the lessor to prove that the lessor used all reasonable endeavours to avoid that breach.
(6)
For the purposes of this section a lease is a “relevant social housing lease” at any time when—
(a)
the lessor under the lease is a registered provider of social housing, and
(b)
the dwelling leased under the lease—
(i)
is social housing, but
(ii)
is not low cost home ownership accommodation.

require the lessor to take particular action, or action that is intended to produce a particular outcome, in relation to a prescribed hazard;
(b)
require the lessor to take action in relation to a prescribed hazard that is not of itself intended to remedy the hazard, for example by requiring the lessor—
(i)
to investigate whether or how a prescribed hazard is affecting the leased dwelling, or
(ii)
to secure that the lessee and any other members of the lessee’s household are provided with alternative accommodation at no cost to them;
(c)

(5)
A power to make regulations under section 10A or this section includes power to make—
(a)
incidental, transitional or saving provision;
(b)
different provision for different purposes.
(6)
The power to make transitional or saving provision may (in particular) be used to make provision about situations where the covenant in section 10A(2)—
(a)
begins to be implied in a lease after its grant because it becomes a relevant social housing lease;
(b)
ceases to be implied in a lease because it ceases to be a relevant social housing lease (including provision to save the lessor’s liability for any breach of the covenant occurring before it ceases to be implied).
(7)
Regulations under section 10A or this section are to be made by statutory instrument.
(8)
A statutory instrument containing regulations under section 10A or this section may not be made unless a draft of it has been laid before and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.”

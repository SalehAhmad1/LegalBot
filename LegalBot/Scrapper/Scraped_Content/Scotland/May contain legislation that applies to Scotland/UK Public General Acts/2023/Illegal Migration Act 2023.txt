Introduction
(1)
The purpose of this Act is to prevent and deter unlawful migration, and in particular migration by unsafe and illegal routes, by requiring the removal from the United Kingdom of certain persons who enter or arrive in the United Kingdom in breach of immigration control.
(2)
To advance that purpose, this Act—
(a)
places a duty on the Secretary of State to make arrangements for the removal of certain persons who enter or arrive in the United Kingdom in breach of immigration control as soon as is reasonably practicable after their entry or arrival, subject only to the exceptions specified by or under this Act;
(b)
provides for protection claims and certain human rights claims made by persons who meet the conditions for removal under this Act to be inadmissible;
(c)
provides for the detention of persons who are subject to removal under this Act;
(d)
provides for protections and entitlements to assistance and support which are available to victims of modern slavery or human trafficking not to apply to persons who are subject to removal under this Act;
(e)
prevents persons who meet the conditions for removal under this Act from being given leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom;
(f)
prevents persons who meet the conditions for removal under this Act from settling in the United Kingdom or obtaining citizenship;
(g)
provides a procedure for persons who are subject to removal under this Act to challenge their removal by means of a suspensive claim (as defined in section 38);
(h)
has the effect that all other legal challenges to the removal of persons under this Act do not suspend the duty to make arrangements for their removal.
(3)
Accordingly, and so far as it is possible to do so, provision made by or by virtue of this Act must be read and given effect so as to achieve the purpose mentioned in subsection (1).
(4)
In addition, this Act makes provision—
(a)
about the period for which persons may be detained in immigration detention;
(b)
for protections that apply to victims of modern slavery or human trafficking not to apply to persons who are a threat to public order or who have claimed to be victims in bad faith unless compelling circumstances apply;
(c)
for persons who have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment for an offence or who are liable to deportation to be deemed to be a threat to public order for the purposes of the disapplication of those protections;
(d)
for asylum claims and human rights claims made by nationals of certain safe States to be inadmissible;
(e)
for the maximum number of persons who may enter the United Kingdom annually using safe and legal routes to be specified in regulations which are subject to approval by Parliament;
(f)
for certain kinds of behaviour relating to an identity document or electronic information by a person who makes an asylum claim or a human rights claim to be taken into account as damaging the claimant’s credibility.
(5)
Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (interpretation of legislation) does not apply in relation to provision made by or by virtue of this Act.

Disregard of certain claims, applications etc

(b)
must not be granted an entry clearance, and

The Secretary of State may give the person limited leave to enter the United Kingdom, or grant to the person an entry clearance or an ETA, if—
(a)
the person has left or been removed from the United Kingdom after having become a person within subsection (1), and
(b)
the Secretary of State considers that—
(i)
failure to give the leave or grant the entry clearance or ETA would contravene the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Human Rights Convention, or
(ii)
there are other exceptional circumstances which apply in relation to the person which mean that it is appropriate to give the leave or grant the entry clearance or ETA.
(4)
The Secretary of State may give the person limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom if—

(5)
If a person in relation to whom section 8AA of the Immigration Act 1971 applies leaves or is removed from the United Kingdom after having become such a person, subsection (4) of this section does not permit the Secretary of State to give the person limited leave to enter the United Kingdom if the person returns to the United Kingdom (but see section 8AA(3) of that Act).
(6)
If a person in relation to whom section 8AA of the Immigration Act 1971 applies is given limited leave to enter the United Kingdom under subsection (3) of that section, subsection (4) of this section does not permit the Secretary of State to give the person limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom (but see section 8AA(4) of that Act).
(7)
Any leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom given to a person by virtue of subsection (4) is to be disregarded in determining, for the purposes of this Act or any other enactment, whether the person meets the four conditions in section 2.

(1)
A “serious harm suspensive claim” made under this Act is not a “human rights claim” for the purposes of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 or the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.
(2)
Accordingly no right of appeal under section 82(1)(a) or (b) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (appeal against refusal of protection claim or human rights claim) arises in relation to any decision of the Secretary of State made under section 42 (serious harm suspensive claims), 46 (out of time claims) or 48 (new matters) of this Act in respect of a serious harm suspensive claim.
(3)
The making of a serious harm suspensive claim by a person (or the possibility of a person making such a claim) does not affect any ability of the person to make a human rights claim in relation to their removal from the United Kingdom to a third country under this Act.
(4)
Where—
(a)
a person subject to removal to a third country under this Act makes a human rights claim in relation to their removal to that third country, and
(b)
the Secretary of State decides to refuse the claim,
there is no right of appeal under section 82(1)(a) or (b) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in relation to that decision.
(5)
Subsection (4) does not affect any ability of the person to make an application for judicial review in relation to a decision of the Secretary of State to refuse the claim (but section 5(1)(d) (disregard of application for judicial review) applies in relation to any such application).

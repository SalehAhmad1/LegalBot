United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020
2020 CHAPTER 27
An Act to make provision in connection with the internal market for goods and services in the United Kingdom (including provision about the recognition of professional and other qualifications); to make provision in connection with provisions of the Northern Ireland Protocol relating to trade and state aid; to authorise the provision of financial assistance by Ministers of the Crown in connection with economic development, infrastructure, culture, sport and educational or training activities and exchanges; to make regulation of the provision of distortive or harmful subsidies a reserved or excepted matter; and for connected purposes.
[17th December 2020]
Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—1
Purpose of Part 1
(1)
This Part promotes the continued functioning of the internal market for goods in the United Kingdom by establishing the United Kingdom market access principles.
(2)
The United Kingdom market access principles are—
(a)
the mutual recognition principle for goods (see sections 2 to 4), and
(b)
the non-discrimination principle for goods (see sections 5 to 9).
(3)
Those principles have no direct legal effect except as provided by this Part.

The mutual recognition principle for goods
(1)
The mutual recognition principle for goods is the principle that goods which—
(a)
have been produced in, or imported into, one part of the United Kingdom (“the originating part”), and
(b)
can be sold there without contravening any relevant requirements that would apply to their sale,
should be able to be sold in any other part of the United Kingdom, free from any relevant requirements that would otherwise apply to the sale.
(2)
Where goods are to be sold in a particular way in the other part of the United Kingdom, the condition in subsection (1)(b) has effect as if the reference to “their sale” were a reference to their sale in that particular way.
So, for example, if goods are to be sold by auction, the condition is met if (and only if) they can be sold by auction in the originating part without contravening any applicable relevant requirements there.
(3)
Where the principle applies in relation to a sale of goods in a part of the United Kingdom because the conditions in subsection (1)(a) and (b) are met, any relevant requirements there do not apply in relation to the sale.

Relevant requirements for the purposes of section 2
(1)
This section defines “relevant requirement” for the purposes of the mutual recognition principle for goods as it applies in relation to a particular sale of goods in a part of the United Kingdom.
(2)
A statutory requirement in the part of the United Kingdom concerned which—
(a)
prohibits the sale of the goods or, in the case of an obligation or condition, results in their sale being prohibited if it is not complied with, and
(b)
is within the scope of the mutual recognition principle,
is a relevant requirement in relation to the sale unless excluded from being a relevant requirement by any provision of this Part.
(3)
A statutory requirement is within the scope of the mutual recognition principle if it relates to any one or more of the following—
(a)
characteristics of the goods themselves (such as their nature, composition, age, quality or performance);
(b)
any matter connected with the presentation of the goods (such as the name or description applied to them or their packaging, labelling, lot-marking or date-stamping);
(c)
any matter connected with the production of the goods or anything from which they are made or is involved in their production, including the place at which, or the circumstances in which, production or any step in production took place;
(d)
any matter relating to the identification or tracing of an animal (such as marking, tagging or micro-chipping or the keeping of particular records);
(e)
the inspection, assessment, registration, certification, approval or, authorisation of the goods or any other similar dealing with them;
(f)
documentation or information that must be produced or recorded, kept, accompany the goods or be submitted to an authority;
(g)
anything not falling within paragraphs (a) to (f) which must (or must not) be done to, or in relation to, the goods before they are allowed to be sold.
(4)
A manner of sale requirement is not within the scope of the mutual recognition principle unless subsection (6) applies.
(5)
For this purpose a “manner of sale requirement” is a statutory requirement that governs any aspect of the circumstances or manner in which the goods are sold (such as where, when, by whom, to whom, or the price or other terms on which they may be sold).
(6)
A statutory requirement that—
(a)
is worded as a manner of sale requirement, but
(b)
appears to be designed artificially to avoid the operation of the mutual recognition principle in relation to what would otherwise be a requirement within the scope of that principle,
is to be regarded as a relevant requirement, despite subsection (4).
This subsection would apply, for example, where a manner of sale requirement involves an unusually restrictive condition such that it would be impossible to comply with the condition and have a practical chance of selling the goods.
(7)
A statutory requirement which requires the person selling or acquiring the goods to keep or submit, after the sale takes place, any documentation or information required to be produced or recorded beforehand is to be treated as a relevant requirement relating to the sale.
(8)
In this Part “statutory requirement” means an obligation, a condition or a prohibition (however described) imposed by legislation (including legislation imposing mandatory terms into contracts for the sale of goods).

Exclusion of certain requirements existing before commencement
(1)
A statutory requirement in a part of the United Kingdom (“the relevant part”) which—
(a)
applies in relation to a particular sale of goods in that part of the United Kingdom, and
(b)
would otherwise fall within section 3 as a relevant requirement,
is not a relevant requirement (so far as relating to the sale) for the purposes of the mutual recognition principle where the conditions in subsection (2) are met.
(2)
The conditions are that, on the relevant day —
(a)
the same statutory requirement would have applied in relation to the sale if it had taken place on that day, and
(b)
there was no corresponding requirement in force in each of the other three parts of the United Kingdom.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2) “the relevant day” is the day before the day on which this section comes into force.
(4)
The re-enactment (without substantive change) of a statutory requirement does not affect its continuity for the purposes of subsection (2)(a).
(5)
For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) “corresponding requirement”, in relation to the statutory requirement in the relevant part of the United Kingdom, means a statutory requirement in another part of the United Kingdom that would have had the same effect in relation to the sale (if it had taken place there on the relevant day).
(6)
For the purposes of subsections (2) and (5) a statutory requirement is to be regarded as the same as another statutory requirement, or having the same effect, if any differences between them are not substantive.

The non-discrimination principle for goods
(1)
The non-discrimination principle for goods is the principle that the sale of goods in one part of the United Kingdom should not be affected by relevant requirements that directly or indirectly discriminate against goods that have a relevant connection with another part of the United Kingdom.
(2)
For the purposes of the application of that principle in any given case—
(a)
the part of the United Kingdom where sale should not be affected is referred to as the “destination part”;
(b)
the goods that have a relevant connection with another part of the United Kingdom are referred to as the “incoming goods”;
(c)
that other part is referred to as the “originating part”.
(3)
A relevant requirement (see section 6) is of no effect in the destination part if, and to the extent that, it directly or indirectly discriminates against the incoming goods (see sections 7 and 8).
(4)
Goods have a relevant connection with a part of the United Kingdom if they or any of their components—
(a)
are produced in that part,
(b)
are produced by a business based in that part, or
(c)
come from, or pass through, that part before reaching the destination part.
(5)
For the purposes of this Part—
(a)
“components” includes parts, ingredients and constituent materials;
(b)
a business is “based”—
(i)
where its registered office is,
(ii)
if it does not have a registered office, where its head office is, or
(iii)
if it has neither a registered office nor a head office, where its principal place of business is.

(1)
This section defines “relevant requirement” for the purposes of the non-discrimination principle for goods.
(2)

(a)
applies in that part of the United Kingdom to, or in relation to, goods sold in that part, and
(b)
is within the scope of the non-discrimination principle.
(3)
A statutory provision is within the scope of the non-discrimination principle if it relates to any one or more of the following—
(a)
the circumstances or manner in which goods are sold (such as where, when, by whom, to whom, or the price or other terms on which they may be sold);
(b)
the transportation, storage, handling or display of goods;
(c)
the inspection, assessment, registration, certification, approval or authorisation of the goods or any similar dealing with them;
(d)
the conduct or regulation of businesses that engage in the sale of certain goods or types of goods.
(4)
A statutory provision is not a relevant requirement—
(a)
to the extent that it is a relevant requirement for the purposes of the mutual recognition principle for goods (see section 3), or
(b)
if section 9 (exclusion of certain existing provisions) so provides.
(5)
The Secretary of State may by regulations amend subsection (3) so as to add, vary or remove a paragraph of that subsection.
(6)
Regulations under subsection (5) are subject to affirmative resolution procedure.
(7)
Before making regulations under subsection (5) the Secretary of State must seek the consent of the Scottish Ministers, the Welsh Ministers and the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland.
(8)
If consent to the making of the regulations is not given by any of those authorities within the period of one month beginning with the day on which it is sought from that authority, the Secretary of State may make the regulations without that consent.
(9)

The non-discrimination principle: direct discrimination
(1)
A relevant requirement directly discriminates against incoming goods if, for the reason that the goods have the relevant connection with the originating part, the requirement applies to, or in relation to, the incoming goods in a way—
(a)
in which it does not or would not apply to local goods, and
(b)
that puts the incoming goods at a disadvantage compared to local goods.
(2)
Goods are put at a disadvantage if it is made in any way more difficult, or less attractive, to sell or buy the goods or do anything in connection with their sale.
(3)
“Local goods”, for the purposes of this section, are actual or hypothetical goods that—
(a)
lack the relevant connection of the incoming goods with the originating part, but
(b)
otherwise are materially the same as, and share the material circumstances of, the incoming goods.
(4)
Goods (“the other goods”) lack the relevant connection of the incoming goods with the originating part—
(a)
where the incoming goods have a relevant connection within section 5(4)(a), if the other goods, or (as the case may be) their components, were produced in the destination part;
(b)
where the incoming goods have a relevant connection within section 5(4)(b), if the other goods, or (as the case may be) their components, were produced by a business based in the destination part;
(c)
where the incoming goods have a relevant connection within section 5(4)(c), if the other goods, or (as the case may be) their components, came from the destination part and did not pass through anywhere outside that part.

The non-discrimination principle: indirect discrimination
(1)
A relevant requirement indirectly discriminates against incoming goods if—
(a)
it does not directly discriminate against the goods,
(b)
it applies to, or in relation to, the incoming goods in a way that puts them at a disadvantage,
(c)
it has an adverse market effect, and
(d)
it cannot reasonably be considered a necessary means of achieving a legitimate aim.
(2)
Goods are put at a disadvantage if it is made in any way more difficult, or less attractive, to sell or buy the goods or do anything in connection with their sale than if the requirement did not apply.
(3)
A requirement has an adverse market effect if, because it—
(a)
puts at a disadvantage the incoming goods (and any comparable goods that also have a relevant connection with the originating part and are also put at that disadvantage), but
(b)
does not put at that disadvantage (at all or to the same extent) some or all comparable goods that have a relevant connection with the destination part and no other part of the United Kingdom,
it causes a significant adverse effect on competition in the market for such goods in the United Kingdom.
(4)
“Comparable goods” means like goods or interchangeable goods; and—
(a)
“like goods” are goods that are alike the incoming goods in all respects, or otherwise have characteristics closely resembling those of the incoming goods;
(b)
“interchangeable goods” are goods that, from the point of view of a purchaser of the goods, could reasonably be said to be interchangeable with the incoming goods.

The application of subsection (3) is to be determined with regard both to the content of the requirement and to the way in which it operates, or is administered, in practice (as a whole or in particular classes of case).
(6)
“Legitimate aim” means one, or a combination, of the following aims—
(a)
the protection of the life or health of humans, animals or plants;

(b)
the availability of alternative means of achieving the aim in question.

That principle does not apply in relation to goods produced in, or imported into, Northern Ireland that are not qualifying Northern Ireland goods, unless subsection (4) applies.
(4)
If goods falling within subsection (3) are moved in a way that would, but for the fact that Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, amount for the purposes of the mutual recognition principle for goods to the importation of the goods into England, Scotland or Wales, the goods are to be regarded for the purposes of that principle as having been so imported.

Interpretation of other expressions used in Part 1
(1)
This section applies for the purposes of this Part.
(2)
“Goods” means any tangible movable, or corporeal moveable, thing (including any packaging or label), but not water or gas that is not offered for sale in a limited volume or set quantity.
(3)
Goods are to be regarded as “produced in” a part of the United Kingdom (if not wholly produced there) if the most recent significant production step which is a regulated step has occurred there.
(4)
A production step occurring in a part of the United Kingdom is “regulated” for the purposes of subsection (3) if —
(a)
it is the subject of any statutory requirement in that part of the United Kingdom, or
(b)
it is a step that could materially affect a person's ability to sell the goods without contravening—
(i)
any relevant requirement for the purposes of the mutual recognition principle for goods, or
(ii)
any statutory requirement that is excluded from being a relevant requirement by section 4(1),
that would be applicable to a sale of the goods in that part of the United Kingdom (being a sale of a kind for which the goods are being produced).
(5)
A production step is “significant” for the purposes of subsection (3) if it is significant in terms of the character of the goods being produced and the purposes for which they are to be sold or used (but see subsections (6) and (7)).
(6)
A production step falling within any of the following descriptions is not significant (whether or not it is regulated)—
(a)
activities carried out specifically to ensure goods do not deteriorate before being sold (such as maintaining them at or below a particular temperature);
(b)
activities carried out solely for purposes relevant to their presentation for sale (such as cleaning or pressing fabrics or sorting different coloured items for packaging together);
(c)
activities involving a communication of any kind with a regulatory or trade body (such as registering the goods or notifying the goods or anything connected with them or their production);
(d)
activities carried out for the purpose of testing or assessing any characteristic of the goods (such as batch testing a pharmaceutical product).
(7)
A production step involving the packaging, labelling or marking of goods is not significant (whether or not it is regulated) unless the step is fundamental to the character of the goods and the purposes for which they are to be sold or used.
(8)
Goods are “imported into” a part of the United Kingdom only if they are imported into that part from outside the United Kingdom.
For this purpose the Isle of Man is outside the United Kingdom.

Goods are to be regarded as imported—
(a)
for goods brought by sea, when the ship carrying them enters the limits of the port at which they are discharged;
(b)
for goods brought by air, when they are unloaded;
(c)
for goods brought by land, when they enter the United Kingdom.
In this subsection “port” and “ship” have the same meaning as in the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (see section 1 of that Act).
(10)
Goods produced in, or imported into, a part of the United Kingdom (“the original part of the United Kingdom”) which are—
(a)
exported to a place outside the United Kingdom, and
(b)
re-imported back into any other part of the United Kingdom,
are, despite the re-importation, to continue to be regarded as goods produced in, or imported into, the original part of the United Kingdom.
(11)
A reference (however expressed) to the production of anything includes—
(a)
cultivation, harvesting and similar activities (in relation to plants or fungi) and
(b)

(4)
A regulatory requirement is a legislative requirement that would if not satisfied (whether at a particular point or on a continuing basis) prevent a service provider from carrying on a business of providing particular services.
(5)
The following are neither authorisation requirements nor regulatory requirements for the purposes of this Part—
(a)
relevant requirements as defined for the purposes of the mutual recognition principle for goods (see section 3);
(b)
provision of the sort described in section 24(1) or 28(1) (professional qualifications and regulation) to the extent it has the effect described there;
(c)
a requirement that—
(i)
is in force, or otherwise has effect, on the day before the day on which this section comes into force and has not been substantively changed after that day, or
(ii)
comes into force, or otherwise takes effect, on or after the day on which this section comes into force if it re-enacts or replicates (without substantive change) a legislative requirement in force or having effect immediately before that day;
(d)
a requirement that applies to a service provider, but which also applies to persons who do not provide services (for example, a requirement imposing duties on employers);
(e)
a requirement to notify, or register with, a regulator;
(f)
a requirement to provide evidence of being authorised to provide services in a part of the United Kingdom other than the part in which the requirement applies.
(6)
Subsection (5)(c) does not exclude (and, accordingly, references to authorisation requirements do include) an authorisation requirement that applies in a part of the United Kingdom if, after the relevant day, a corresponding authorisation requirement in another part of the United Kingdom is substantively changed.
(7)
For the purposes of subsection (6)—
(a)
an authorisation requirement corresponds to another authorisation requirement if it relates to the same, or substantially the same, services;
(b)
the “relevant day” is the day before the day on which this section comes into force.
(8)
For the purposes of this section, an authorisation requirement is substantively changed if a legislative requirement that would, if not satisfied, prevent a service provider from satisfying the authorisation requirement is substantively changed.
(9)
In this Part—
“service provider” means a person—
(a)
that provides, or intends to provide, services in the course of the person's business, and
(b)
that has a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom through which that business is wholly or partly carried on;
“permanent establishment”—
(a)
in relation to a company, is to be read in accordance with Chapter 2 of Part 24 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010, and
(b)
in relation to any other person, is to be read in accordance with that Chapter but as if references in that Chapter to a company were references to that person.

(2)
A regulatory requirement directly discriminates against a service provider if—

Meaning of “qualified” UK resident
(1)
A UK resident is “qualified” in relation to a profession for the purposes of section 24(2) if, in any part of the United Kingdom other than the relevant part (“the other part”), the resident is qualified (within the meaning of subsections (3) to (5)) to undertake the full range of corresponding activity.
(2)
In this section—
(a)
“corresponding activity” means activity that is the same as, or substantially corresponds to, relevant professional activity;
(b)
“the full range” of corresponding activity is a range of corresponding activity that substantially corresponds to the full range of relevant professional activity;
(c)
“relevant professional activity” means activity that, in the relevant part, ordinarily comprises the practice of the profession in question.
(3)
To the extent that—
(a)
corresponding activity is ordinarily undertaken by practitioners of a particular profession in the other part, and
(b)
provision applying in the other part limits the ability to practise that profession to individuals who have certain qualifications or experience,
a UK resident is qualified to undertake the corresponding activity if the resident has the qualifications or experience required to be able to practise the profession in the other part.
(4)
To the extent that—
(a)
the position is not as described in subsection (3)(a) and (b), and
(b)
provision applying in the other part limits the ability to undertake corresponding activity to individuals who have certain qualifications or experience,
a UK resident is qualified to undertake the corresponding activity if the resident has the qualifications or experience required to do so in the other part.
(5)
To the extent that the position is not as described in subsection (3)(a) and (b) or (4)(b), any UK resident is qualified to undertake corresponding activity in the other part.
(6)
For the purposes of subsection (3)—
(a)
it does not matter that corresponding activity may also be undertaken by individuals who are not practitioners of a profession;
(b)
to the extent that corresponding activity is ordinarily undertaken by practitioners of more than one profession regulated as mentioned in subsection (3)(b), a UK resident is qualified in relation to that activity only if the resident has qualifications or experience required to be able to practise whichever of those professions most closely corresponds to the profession in the relevant part.
(7)
For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4)—
(a)
qualifications may be relied on only if they were obtained in the United Kingdom, and
(b)
experience may be relied on only if it was obtained mainly in the United Kingdom.

Exception from section 24 where individual assessment offered
(1)
Section 24(2) does not apply in a case where the qualified UK resident—
(a)
is able to seek, or has sought, to be able to practise the profession in the relevant part by way of a process that satisfies the requirements of this section, and
(b)
has not lawfully practised the profession in the relevant part at any time before being able to seek that ability by way of that process.
(2)
The process must have the result that, if the regulatory body so decides on an application by the qualified UK resident, the resident becomes able to practise the profession—
(a)
despite the limitation referred to in section 24(1), and
(b)
without further assessment of the resident's qualifications, experience, knowledge or skills (except in connection with the sort of provision referred to in section 24(3)).
(3)
The process must require the application to be dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (4).
(4)
The principles are that, in connection with the ability to practise a profession in the relevant part—
(a)
qualifications or experience obtained in any other part of the United Kingdom should have the same effect as qualifications or experience obtained in the relevant part, to the extent that the former demonstrate the like knowledge and skills to substantially the same standard as the latter;
(b)
the applicant should be able to rely on any qualifications or experience obtained in any other part of the United Kingdom in order to demonstrate the necessary knowledge and skills, so far as those qualifications or experience are reasonably capable of demonstrating them;
(c)
to the extent that the applicant cannot, on application of the principles set out in paragraphs (a) and (b), demonstrate the necessary knowledge and skills to the satisfaction of the regulatory body, the applicant should (subject to subsection (5)) have an opportunity to do so by way of a test or assessment the demands of which are proportionate to the deficiency;
(d)
if the applicant can, on application of the principles set out in paragraphs (a) to (c), demonstrate the necessary knowledge and skills to the satisfaction of the regulatory body, the regulatory body should decide as mentioned in subsection (2).
(5)
The process may, without contravening the principle set out in subsection (4)(c), allow the regulatory body in a case to which this subsection applies to decline the application without the applicant first being offered a test or assessment as described in that principle.
(6)
Subsection (5) applies if the test or assessment would (having regard to the knowledge and skills demonstrated by the applicant in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (4)(a) and (b)) be similarly demanding to obtaining so much of the usual qualifications or experience as the applicant lacks.
(7)
The process must require the regulatory body to inform the applicant of its decision within a reasonable time from the receipt of the application.
(8)
Subsection (1) ceases to apply in the case of an applicant if, before the regulatory body informs the applicant of its decision—
(a)
the regulatory body accepts in writing, or
(b)
a court determines in legal proceedings,
that the regulatory body has failed to satisfy the requirement referred to in subsection (7).
(9)
A regulatory body that administers a process to which this section applies must publish information about—
(a)
the procedure for making an application within the process, and
(b)
the way in which the principles set out in subsection (4) will be given effect in the context of the profession concerned.
But a failure to comply with this duty does not mean that the process does not comply with the requirements of this section.
(10)
In this section—
“the usual qualifications or experience” means the qualifications or experience that are, under the provision that falls within section 24(1), required in order to be able to practise the profession concerned in the relevant part;
“the necessary knowledge and skills” means the knowledge and skills that are demonstrated by the usual qualifications or experience;
“regulatory body” means—
(a)
the person, if any, responsible for determining whether a person has the qualifications or experience referred to in section 24(1), or
(b)
if there is no such person, the responsible administration;
“responsible administration” means—
(a)
if the relevant part is Scotland and the provision that falls within section 24(1)—
(i)
would be within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament if contained in an Act of that Parliament, or
(ii)
is provision which could be made in subordinate legislation by the Scottish Ministers, the First Minister or the Lord Advocate acting alone,
the Scottish Ministers;
(b)
if the relevant part is Wales and the provision that falls within section 24(1)—
(i)
would be within the legislative competence of Senedd Cymru if contained in an Act of Senedd Cymru (assuming that any consent by a Minister of the Crown were given), or
(ii)
is provision which could be made in subordinate legislation by the Welsh Ministers acting alone,
the Welsh Ministers;
(c)
if the relevant part is Northern Ireland and the provision that falls within section 24(1)—
(i)
would be within the legislative competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and would not require the consent of the Secretary of State, if contained in an Act of that Assembly,
(ii)
is contained in, or was made under, Northern Ireland legislation, and would be within the legislative competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and would require the consent of the Secretary of State, if contained in an Act of that Assembly, or
(iii)
is provision which could be made in subordinate legislation by the First Minister and deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland acting jointly, a Northern Ireland Minister or a Northern Ireland department,
a Northern Ireland department;
(d)
in any other case, the Secretary of State.

The judicial or administrative authorities of the Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child have jurisdiction to take measures directed to the protection of the child's person or property.
(2)
Subject to Article 7, in case of a change of the child's habitual residence to another Contracting State, the authorities of the State of the new habitual residence have jurisdiction.
Article 6
(1)
For refugee children and children who, due to disturbances occurring in their country, are internationally displaced, the authorities of the Contracting State on the territory of which these children are present as a result of their displacement have the jurisdiction provided for in paragraph 1 of Article 5.
(2)
The provisions of the preceding paragraph also apply to children whose habitual residence cannot be established.
Article 7
(1)
In case of wrongful removal or retention of the child, the authorities of the Contracting State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention keep their jurisdiction until the child has acquired a habitual residence in another State, and
(a)
each person, institution or other body having rights of custody has acquiesced in the removal or retention; or
(b)
the child has resided in that other State for a period of at least one year after the person, institution or other body having rights of custody has or should have had knowledge of the whereabouts of the child, no request for return lodged within that period is still pending, and the child is settled in his or her new environment.
(2)
The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where—
(a)
it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and
(b)
at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.
The rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State.
(3)
So long as the authorities first mentioned in paragraph 1 keep their jurisdiction, the authorities of the Contracting State to which the child has been removed or in which he or she has been retained can take only such urgent measures under Article 11 as are necessary for the protection of the person or property of the child.
Article 8
(1)
By way of exception, the authority of a Contracting State having jurisdiction under Article 5 or 6, if it considers that the authority of another Contracting State would be better placed in the particular case to assess the best interests of the child, may either
— request that other authority, directly or with the assistance of the Central Authority of its State, to assume jurisdiction to take such measures of protection as it considers to be necessary, or
— suspend consideration of the case and invite the parties to introduce such a request before the authority of that other State.
(2)
The Contracting States whose authorities may be addressed as provided in the preceding paragraph are—
(a)
a State of which the child is a national,
(b)
a State in which property of the child is located,
(c)
a State whose authorities are seised of an application for divorce or legal separation of the child's parents, or for annulment of their marriage,
(d)
a State with which the child has a substantial connection.
(3)
The authorities concerned may proceed to an exchange of views.
(4)
The authority addressed as provided in paragraph 1 may assume jurisdiction, in place of the authority having jurisdiction under Article 5 or 6, if it considers that this is in the child's best interests.
Article 9
(1)
If the authorities of a Contracting State referred to in Article 8, paragraph 2, consider that they are better placed in the particular case to assess the child's best interests, they may either
— request the competent authority of the Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child, directly or with the assistance of the Central Authority of that State, that they be authorised to exercise jurisdiction to take the measures of protection which they consider to be necessary, or
— invite the parties to introduce such a request before the authority of the Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child.
(2)
The authorities concerned may proceed to an exchange of views.
(3)
The authority initiating the request may exercise jurisdiction in place of the authority of the Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child only if the latter authority has accepted the request.
Article 10
(1)
Without prejudice to Articles 5 to 9, the authorities of a Contracting State exercising jurisdiction to decide upon an application for divorce or legal separation of the parents of a child habitually resident in another Contracting State, or for annulment of their marriage, may, if the law of their State so provides, take measures directed to the protection of the person or property of such child if—
(a)
at the time of commencement of the proceedings, one of his or her parents habitually resides in that State and one of them has parental responsibility in relation to the child, and
(b)
the jurisdiction of these authorities to take such measures has been accepted by the parents, as well as by any other person who has parental responsibility in relation to the child, and is in the best interests of the child.
(2)
The jurisdiction provided for by paragraph 1 to take measures for the protection of the child ceases as soon as the decision allowing or refusing the application for divorce, legal separation or annulment of the marriage has become final, or the proceedings have come to an end for another reason.
Article 11
(1)
In all cases of urgency, the authorities of any Contracting State in whose territory the child or property belonging to the child is present have jurisdiction to take any necessary measures of protection.
(2)
The measures taken under the preceding paragraph with regard to a child habitually resident in a Contracting State shall lapse as soon as the authorities which have jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 have taken the measures required by the situation.
(3)
The measures taken under paragraph 1 with regard to a child who is habitually resident in a non-Contracting State shall lapse in each Contracting State as soon as measures required by the situation and taken by the authorities of another State are recognised in the Contracting State in question.
Article 12
(1)
Subject to Article 7, the authorities of a Contracting State in whose territory the child or property belonging to the child is present have jurisdiction to take measures of a provisional character for the protection of the person or property of the child which have a territorial effect limited to the State in question, in so far as such measures are not incompatible with measures already taken by authorities which have jurisdiction under Article 5 to 10.
(2)
The measures taken under the preceding paragraph with regard to a child habitually resident in a Contracting State shall lapse as soon as the authorities which have jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 have taken a decision in respect of the measures of protection which may be required by the situation.
(3)
The measures taken under paragraph 1 with regard to a child who is habitually resident in a non-Contracting State shall lapse in the Contracting State where the measures were taken as soon as measures required by the situation and taken by the authorities of another State are recognised in the Contracting State in question.
Article 13
(1)
The authorities of a Contracting State which have jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 to take measures for the protection of the person or property of the child must abstain from exercising this jurisdiction if, at the time of the commencement of the proceedings, corresponding measures have been requested from the authorities of another Contracting State having jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 at the time of the request and are still under consideration.
(2)
The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not apply if the authorities before whom the request for measures was initially introduced have declined jurisdiction.
Article 14
The measures taken in application of Articles 5 to 10 remain in force according to their terms, even if a change of circumstances has eliminated the basis upon which jurisdiction was founded, so long as the authorities which have jurisdiction under the Convention have not modified, replaced or terminated such measures.
CHAPTER III
APPLICABLE LAW
Article 15
(1)
In exercising their jurisdiction under the provisions of Chapter II, the authorities of the Contracting States shall apply their own law.
(2)
However, in so far as the protection of the person or the property of the child requires, they may exceptionally apply or take into consideration the law of another State with which the situation has a substantial connection.
(3)
If the child's habitual residence changes to another Contracting State, the law of that other State governs, from the time of the change, the conditions of application of the measures taken in the State of the former habitual residence.
Article 16
(1)
The attribution or extinction of parental responsibility by operation of law, without the intervention of a judicial or administrative authority, is governed by the law of the State of the habitual residence of the child.
(2)
The attribution or extinction of parental responsibility by an agreement or a unilateral act, without intervention of a judicial or administrative authority, is governed by the law of the State of the child's habitual residence at the time when the agreement or unilateral act takes effect.
(3)
Parental responsibility which exists under the law of the State of the child's habitual residence subsists after a change of that habitual residence to another State.
(4)
If the child's habitual residence changes, the attribution of parental responsibilty by operation of law to a person who does not already have such responsibility is governed by the law of the State of the new habitual residence.
Article 17
The exercise of parental responsibility is governed by the law of the State of the child's habitual residence. If the child's habitual residence changes, it is governed by the law of the State of the new habitual residence.
Article 18
The parental responsibility referred to in Article 16 may be terminated, or the conditions of its exercise modified, by measures taken under this Convention.
Article 19
(1)
The validity of a transaction entered into between a third party and another person who would be entitled to act as the child's legal representative under the law of the State where the transaction was concluded cannot be contested, and the third party cannot be held liable, on the sole ground that the other person was not entitled to act as the child's legal representative under the law designated by the provisions of this Chapter, unless the third party knew or should have known that the parental responsibility was governed by the latter law.
(2)
The preceding paragraph applies only if the transaction was entered into between persons present on the territory of the same State.
Article 20
The provisions of this Chapter apply even if the law designated by them is the law of a non-Contracting State.
Article 21
(1)
In this Chapter the term “law” means the law in force in a State other than its choice of law rules.
(2)
However, if the law applicable according to Article 16 is that of a non-Contracting State and if the choice of law rules of that State designate the law of another non-Contracting State which would apply its own law, the law of the latter State applies. If that other non-Contracting State would not apply its own law, the applicable law is that designated by Article 16.
Article 22
The application of the law designated by the provisions of this Chapter can be refused only if this application would be manifestly contrary to public policy, taking into account the best interests of the child.
CHAPTER IV
RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT
Article 23
(1)
The measures taken by the authorities of a Contracting State shall be recognised by operation of law in all other Contracting States.
(2)
Recognition may however be refused—
(a)
if the measure was taken by an authority whose jurisdiction was not based on one of the grounds provided for in Chapter II;

if the measure was taken, except in a case of urgency, in the context of a judicial or administrative proceeding, without the child having been provided the opportunity to be heard, in violation of fundamental principles of procedure of the requested State;
(c)
on the request of any person claiming that the measure infringes his or her parental responsibility, if such measure was taken, except in a case of urgency, without such person having been given an opportunity to be heard;

if such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy of the requested State, taking into account the best interests of the child;
(e)
if the measure is incompatible with a later measure taken in the non-Contracting State of the habitual residence of the child, where this later measure fulfils the requirements for recognition in the requested State;
(f)
if the procedure provided in Article 33 has not been complied with.
Article 24
(1)
Without prejudice to Article 23, paragraph 1, any interested person may request from the competent authorities of a Contracting State that they decide on the recognition or non-recognition of a measure taken in another Contracting State. The procedure is governed by the law of the requested State.
Article 25
The authority of the requested State is bound by the findings of fact on which the authority of the State where the measure was taken based its jurisdiction.
Article 26

request the competent authority of its State to consider the need to take measures for the protection of the person or property of the child.
Article 33
(1)
If an authority having jurisdiction under Articles 5 to 10 contemplates the placement of the child in a foster family or institutional care, or the provision of care by kafala or an analogous institution, and if such placement or such provision of care is to take place in another Contracting State, it shall first consult with the Central Authority or other competent authority of the latter State. To that effect it shall transmit a report on the child together with the reasons for the proposed placement or provision of care.

Article 53
(1)
The Convention shall apply to measures only if they are taken in a State after the Convention has entered into force for that State.

Text of the 2005 Hague Convention
Convention on Choice of Court Agreements
(Concluded 30 June 2005)
The States Parties to the present Convention,
Desiring to promote international trade and investment through enhanced judicial co-operation,
Believing that such co-operation can be enhanced by uniform rules on jurisdiction and on recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in civil or commercial matters,
Believing that such enhanced co-operation requires in particular an international legal regime that provides certainty and ensures the effectiveness of exclusive choice of court agreements between parties to commercial transactions and that governs the recognition and enforcement of judgments resulting from proceedings based on such agreements,
Have resolved to conclude this Convention and have agreed upon the following provisions—
CHAPTER I
SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS
ARTICLE 1
Scope
(1)
This Convention shall apply in international cases to exclusive choice of court agreements concluded in civil or commercial matters.
(2)
For the purposes of Chapter II, a case is international unless the parties are resident in the same Contracting State and the relationship of the parties and all other elements relevant to the dispute, regardless of the location of the chosen court, are connected only with that State.
(3)
For the purposes of Chapter III, a case is international where recognition or enforcement of a foreign judgment is sought.
Article 2
Exclusions from scope
(1)
This Convention shall not apply to exclusive choice of court agreements—
(a)
to which a natural person acting primarily for personal, family or household purposes (a consumer) is a party;
(b)
relating to contracts of employment, including collective agreements.
(2)
This Convention shall not apply to the following matters—
(a)
the status and legal capacity of natural persons;
(b)
maintenance obligations;
(c)
other family law matters, including matrimonial property regimes and other rights or obligations arising out of marriage or similar relationships;
(d)
wills and succession;
(e)
insolvency, composition and analogous matters;
(f)
the carriage of passengers and goods;
(g)
marine pollution, limitation of liability for maritime claims, general average, and emergency towage and salvage;
(h)
anti-trust (competition) matters;
(i)
liability for nuclear damage;
(j)
claims for personal injury brought by or on behalf of natural persons;
(k)
tort or delict claims for damage to tangible property that do not arise from a contractual relationship;
(l)
rights in rem in immovable property, and tenancies of immovable property;
(m)
the validity, nullity, or dissolution of legal persons, and the validity of decisions of their organs;
(n)
the validity of intellectual property rights other than copyright and related rights;
(o)
infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright and related rights, except where infringement proceedings are brought for breach of a contract between the parties relating to such rights, or could have been brought for breach of that contract;
(p)
the validity of entries in public registers.
(3)
Notwithstanding paragraph 2, proceedings are not excluded from the scope of this Convention where a matter excluded under that paragraph arises merely as a preliminary question and not as an object of the proceedings. In particular, the mere fact that a matter excluded under paragraph 2 arises by way of defence does not exclude proceedings from the Convention, if that matter is not an object of the proceedings.
(4)
This Convention shall not apply to arbitration and related proceedings.
(5)
Proceedings are not excluded from the scope of this Convention by the mere fact that a State, including a government, a governmental agency or any person acting for a State, is a party thereto.
(6)
Nothing in this Convention shall affect privileges and immunities of States or of international organisations, in respect of themselves and of their property.
Article 3
Exclusive choice of court agreements
For the purposes of this Convention—
(a)
“exclusive choice of court agreement” means an agreement concluded by two or more parties that meets the requirements of paragraph (c) and designates, for the purpose of deciding disputes which have arisen or may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, the courts of one Contracting State or one or more specific courts of one Contracting State to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of any other courts;
(b)
a choice of court agreement which designates the courts of one Contracting State or one or more specific courts of one Contracting State shall be deemed to be exclusive unless the parties have expressly provided otherwise;
(c)
an exclusive choice of court agreement must be concluded or documented—
(i)
in writing; or
(ii)
by any other means of communication which renders information accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference;
(d)
an exclusive choice of court agreement that forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. The validity of the exclusive choice of court agreement cannot be contested solely on the ground that the contract is not valid.
Article 4
Other definitions
(1)
In this Convention, “judgment” means any decision on the merits given by a court, whatever it may be called, including a decree or order, and a determination of costs or expenses by the court (including an officer of the court), provided that the determination relates to a decision on the merits which may be recognised or enforced under this Convention. An interim measure of protection is not a judgment.
(2)
For the purposes of this Convention, an entity or person other than a natural person shall be considered to be resident in the State—
(a)
where it has its statutory seat;
(b)
under whose law it was incorporated or formed;
(c)
where it has its central administration; or
(d)
where it has its principal place of business.
CHAPTER II
JURISDICTION
Article 5
Jurisdiction of the chosen court
(1)
The court or courts of a Contracting State designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement shall have jurisdiction to decide a dispute to which the agreement applies, unless the agreement is null and void under the law of that State.
(2)
A court that has jurisdiction under paragraph 1 shall not decline to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that the dispute should be decided in a court of another State.
(3)
The preceding paragraphs shall not affect rules—
(a)
on jurisdiction related to subject matter or to the value of the claim;
(b)
on the internal allocation of jurisdiction among the courts of a Contracting State.
However, where the chosen court has discretion as to whether to transfer a case, due consideration should be given to the choice of the parties.
Article 6
Obligations of a court not chosen
A court of a Contracting State other than that of the chosen court shall suspend or dismiss proceedings to which an exclusive choice of court agreement applies unless—
(a)
the agreement is null and void under the law of the State of the chosen court;
(b)
a party lacked the capacity to conclude the agreement under the law of the State of the court seised;
(c)
giving effect to the agreement would lead to a manifest injustice or would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the State of the court seised;
(d)
for exceptional reasons beyond the control of the parties, the agreement cannot reasonably be performed; or
(e)
the chosen court has decided not to hear the case.
Article 7
Interim measures of protection
Interim measures of protection are not governed by this Convention. This Convention neither requires nor precludes the grant, refusal or termination of interim measures of protection by a court of a Contracting State and does not affect whether or not a party may request or a court should grant, refuse or terminate such measures.
CHAPTER III
RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT
Article 8
Registration and enforcement
(1)
A judgment given by a court of a Contracting State designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement shall be recognised and enforced in other Contracting States in accordance with this Chapter. Recognition or enforcement may be refused only on the grounds specified in this Convention.
(2)
Without prejudice to such review as is necessary for the application of the provisions of this Chapter, there shall be no review of the merits of the judgment given by the court of origin. The court addressed shall be bound by the findings of fact on which the court of origin based its jurisdiction, unless the judgment was given by default.
(3)
A judgment shall be recognised only if it has effect in the State of origin, and shall be enforced only if it is enforceable in the State of origin.
(4)
Recognition or enforcement may be postponed or refused if the judgment is the subject of review in the State of origin or if the time limit for seeking ordinary review has not expired. A refusal does not prevent a subsequent application for recognition or enforcement of the judgment.
(5)
This Article shall also apply to a judgment given by a court of a Contracting State pursuant to a transfer of the case from the chosen court in that Contracting State as permitted by Article 5, paragraph 3. However, where the chosen court had discretion as to whether to transfer the case to another court, recognition or enforcement of the judgment may be refused against a party who objected to the transfer in a timely manner in the State of origin.
Article 9
Refusal of recognition or enforcement
Recognition or enforcement may be refused if—
(a)
the agreement was null and void under the law of the State of the chosen court, unless the chosen court has determined that the agreement is valid;
(b)
a party lacked the capacity to conclude the agreement under the law of the requested State;
(c)
the document which instituted the proceedings or an equivalent document, including the essential elements of the claim,
(i)
was not notified to the defendant in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant entered an appearance and presented his case without contesting notification in the court of origin, provided that the law of the State of origin permitted notification to be contested; or
(ii)
was notified to the defendant in the requested State in a manner that is incompatible with fundamental principles of the requested State concerning service of documents;
(d)
the judgment was obtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure;
(e)
recognition or enforcement would be manifestly incompatible with the public policy of the requested State, including situations where the specific proceedings leading to the judgment were incompatible with fundamental principles of procedural fairness of that State;
(f)
the judgment is inconsistent with a judgment given in the requested State in a dispute between the same parties; or
(g)
the judgment is inconsistent with an earlier judgment given in another State between the same parties on the same cause of action, provided that the earlier judgment fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the requested State.
Article 10
Preliminary questions
(1)
Where a matter excluded under Article 2, paragraph 2, or under Article 21, arose as a preliminary question, the ruling on that question shall not be recognised or enforced under this Convention.
(2)
Recognition or enforcement of a judgment may be refused if, and to the extent that, the judgment was based on a ruling on a matter excluded under Article 2, paragraph 2.
(3)
However, in the case of a ruling on the validity of an intellectual property right other than copyright or a related right, recognition or enforcement of a judgment may be refused or postponed under the preceding paragraph only where—
(a)
that ruling is inconsistent with a judgment or a decision of a competent authority on that matter given in the State under the law of which the intellectual property right arose; or
(b)
proceedings concerning the validity of the intellectual property right are pending in that State.
(4)
Recognition or enforcement of a judgment may be refused if, and to the extent that, the judgment was based on a ruling on a matter excluded pursuant to a declaration made by the requested State under Article 21.
Article 11
Damages
(1)
Recognition or enforcement of a judgment may be refused if, and to the extent that, the judgment awards damages, including exemplary or punitive damages, that do not compensate a party for actual loss or harm suffered.
(2)
The court addressed shall take into account whether and to what extent the damages awarded by the court of origin serve to cover costs and expenses relating to the proceedings.
Article 12
Judicial settlements (transactions judiciaires)
Judicial settlements (transactions judiciaires) which a court of a Contracting State designated in an exclusive choice of court agreement has approved, or which have been concluded before that court in the course of proceedings, and which are enforceable in the same manner as a judgment in the State of origin, shall be enforced under this Convention in the same manner as a judgment.
Article 13
Documents to be produced
(1)
The party seeking recognition or applying for enforcement shall produce—
(a)
a complete and certified copy of the judgment;
(b)
the exclusive choice of court agreement, a certified copy thereof, or other evidence of its existence;
(c)
if the judgment was given by default, the original or a certified copy of a document establishing that the document which instituted the proceedings or an equivalent document was notified to the defaulting party;
(d)
any documents necessary to establish that the judgment has effect or, where applicable, is enforceable in the State of origin;
(e)
in the case referred to in Article 12, a certificate of a court of the State of origin that the judicial settlement or a part of it is enforceable in the same manner as a judgment in the State of origin.
(2)
If the terms of the judgment do not permit the court addressed to verify whether the conditions of this Chapter have been complied with, that court may require any necessary documents.
(3)
An application for recognition or enforcement may be accompanied by a document, issued by a court (including an officer of the court) of the State of origin, in the form recommended and published by the Hague Conference on Private International Law.
(4)
If the documents referred to in this Article are not in an official language of the requested State, they shall be accompanied by a certified translation into an official language, unless the law of the requested State provides otherwise.
Article 14
Procedure
The procedure for recognition, declaration of enforceability or registration for enforcement, and the enforcement of the judgment, are governed by the law of the requested State unless this Convention provides otherwise. The court addressed shall act expeditiously.
Article 15
Severability
Recognition or enforcement of a severable part of a judgment shall be granted where recognition or enforcement of that part is applied for, or only part of the judgment is capable of being recognised or enforced under this Convention.

(1)
A Contracting State may declare that its courts will recognise and enforce judgments given by courts of other Contracting States designated in a choice of court agreement concluded by two or more parties that meets the requirements of Article 3, paragraph (c), and designates, for the purpose of deciding disputes which have arisen or may arise in connection with a particular legal relationship, a court or courts of one or more Contracting States (a non-exclusive choice of court agreement).
(2)
Where recognition or enforcement of a judgment given in a Contracting State that has made such a declaration is sought in another Contracting State that has made such a declaration, the judgment shall be recognised and enforced under this Convention, if—
(a)
the court of origin was designated in a non-exclusive choice of court agreement;

(3)
A court in a territorial unit of a Contracting State with two or more territorial units in which different systems of law apply shall not be bound to recognise or enforce a judgment from another Contracting State solely because the judgment has been recognised or enforced in another territorial unit of the same Contracting State under this Convention.

(3)
This Convention shall not affect the application by a Contracting State of a treaty that was concluded before this Convention entered into force for that Contracting State, if applying this Convention would be inconsistent with the obligations of that Contracting State to any non-Contracting State. This paragraph shall also apply to treaties that revise or replace a treaty concluded before this Convention entered into force for that Contracting State, except to the extent that the revision or replacement creates new inconsistencies with this Convention.
(4)

may be made the subject of an appeal to or review by a judicial authority; and

Article 20
Bases for recognition and enforcement
(1)
A decision made in one Contracting State (“the State of origin”) shall be recognised and enforced in other Contracting States if—
(a)
the respondent was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time proceedings were instituted;
(b)
the respondent has submitted to the jurisdiction either expressly or by defending on the merits of the case without objecting to the jurisdiction at the first available opportunity;
(c)
the creditor was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time proceedings were instituted;

(e)
except in disputes relating to maintenance obligations in respect of children, there has been agreement to the jurisdiction in writing by the parties; or
(f)
the decision was made by an authority exercising jurisdiction on a matter of personal status or parental responsibility, unless that jurisdiction was based solely on the nationality of one of the parties.
(2)
A Contracting State may make a reservation, in accordance with Article 62, in respect of paragraph 1 (c), (e) or (f).
(3)
A Contracting State making a reservation under paragraph 2 shall recognise and enforce a decision if its law would in similar factual circumstances confer or would have conferred jurisdiction on its authorities to make such a decision.
(4)
A Contracting State shall, if recognition of a decision is not possible as a result of a reservation under paragraph 2, and if the debtor is habitually resident in that State, take all appropriate measures to establish a decision for the benefit of the creditor. The preceding sentence shall not apply to direct requests for recognition and enforcement under Article 19(5) or to claims for support referred to in Article 2(1) (b).
(5)
A decision in favour of a child under the age of 18 years which cannot be recognised by virtue only of a reservation in respect of paragraph 1 (c), (e) or (f) shall be accepted as establishing the eligibility of that child for maintenance in the State addressed.
(6)
A decision shall be recognised only if it has effect in the State of origin, and shall be enforced only if it is enforceable in the State of origin.
Article 21
Severability and partial recognition and enforcement
(1)
If the State addressed is unable to recognise or enforce the whole of the decision, it shall recognise or enforce any severable part of the decision which can be so recognised or enforced.
(2)
Partial recognition or enforcement of a decision can always be applied for.
Article 22
Grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement

recognition and enforcement of the decision is manifestly incompatible with the public policy (“ordre public”) of the State addressed;
(b)
the decision was obtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure;
(c)
proceedings between the same parties and having the same purpose are pending before an authority of the State addressed and those proceedings were the first to be instituted;
(d)
the decision is incompatible with a decision rendered between the same parties and having the same purpose, either in the State addressed or in another State, provided that this latter decision fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition and enforcement in the State addressed;
(e)
in a case where the respondent has neither appeared nor was represented in proceedings in the State of origin—
(i)
when the law of the State of origin provides for notice of proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard; or
(ii)
when the law of the State of origin does not provide for notice of the proceedings, the respondent did not have proper notice of the decision and an opportunity to challenge or appeal it on fact and law; or
(f)
the decision was made in violation of Article 18.
Article 23
Procedure on an application for recognition and enforcement

Subject to the provisions of the Convention, the procedures for recognition and enforcement shall be governed by the law of the State addressed.

(7)
A challenge or appeal may be founded only on the following—
(a)
the grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement set out in Article 22;
(b)
the bases for recognition and enforcement under Article 20;
(c)
the authenticity or integrity of any document transmitted in accordance with Article 25(1) (a), (b) or (d) or (3) (b).
(8)

(9)
The applicant and the respondent shall be promptly notified of the decision following the challenge or the appeal.
(10)
A further appeal, if permitted by the law of the State addressed, shall not have the effect of staying the enforcement of the decision unless there are exceptional circumstances.

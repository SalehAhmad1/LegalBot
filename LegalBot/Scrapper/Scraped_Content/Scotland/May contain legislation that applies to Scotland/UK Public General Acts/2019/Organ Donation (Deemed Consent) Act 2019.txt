In subsection (6), after paragraph (b) insert—
“(ba)

“(6A)
This subsection applies to the following activities done in England unless the body is the body of an excepted adult—
(a)
the storage of the body of a deceased person for use for the purpose of transplantation;
(b)
the removal from the body of a deceased person, for use for the purpose of transplantation, of any permitted material of which the body consists or which it contains;
(c)
the storage for use for the purpose of transplantation of any permitted material which has come from a human body;
(d)
the use for the purpose of transplantation of any permitted material which has come from a human body.
(6B)
The person concerned is to be deemed, for the purposes of subsection (6)(ba), to have consented to the activity unless a person who stood in a qualifying relationship to the person concerned immediately before death provides information that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the person concerned would not have consented.”
(5)
After subsection (8) insert—
“(9)
In subsection (6A)—
“excepted adult” means—
(a)
an adult who has died and who had not been ordinarily resident in England for a period of at least 12 months immediately before dying, or

“permitted material” means relevant material other than relevant material of a type specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State.

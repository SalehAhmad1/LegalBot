The NHS payment scheme
(1)
NHS England must publish a document, to be known as “the NHS payment scheme”, containing rules for determining the price that is to be payable by a commissioner—
(a)
for the provision of health care services for the purposes of the NHS;
(b)
for the provision of services in pursuance of arrangements made by NHS England or an integrated care board in the exercise of any public health functions of the Secretary of State, within the meaning of the National Health Service Act 2006, by virtue of any provision of that Act.
(2)
The commissioner and the provider of services mentioned in subsection (1) must comply with rules under that subsection.
(3)
Rules under subsection (1) may, in particular—
(a)
specify prices;
(b)
specify amounts, formulae or other matters on the basis of which prices are to be determined;
(c)
provide for prices to be determined for, or by reference to, components of services or groups of services;
(d)
make different provision for different services or provision for some services but not others;
(e)
make different provision for the same service by reference to different circumstances or areas, different descriptions of provider, or other factors relevant to the provision of the service or the arrangements for its provision;
(f)
confer a discretion on the commissioner of a service or on NHS England.
(4)
Rules under subsection (1) may allow or require a price to be agreed between the commissioner and the provider of a service.
(5)
Rules made by virtue of subsection (4) may—
(a)
make provision about how the price is to be agreed;
(b)
allow the agreement to make any provision that could be made by rules by virtue of subsection (3);
(c)
provide for the publication by the commissioner, the provider or NHS England of information relevant to the agreement.
(6)
For the purpose of securing that the prices payable for the provision of services mentioned in subsection (1)(a) or (b) result in a fair level of pay for providers of those services, NHS England must, in exercising functions under subsection (1), have regard to—
(a)
differences in the costs incurred in providing those services to persons of different descriptions, and
(b)
differences between providers with respect to the range of those services that they provide.
(7)
The NHS payment scheme may contain rules relating to the making of payments to the provider of a service for the provision of that service.
(8)
The NHS payment scheme may contain guidance as to the application of rules under subsection (1).
(9)
A commissioner of a service mentioned in subsection (1) must have regard to any such guidance.
(10)
The NHS payment scheme has effect for the period specified in the NHS payment scheme or, where a new edition of the NHS payment scheme takes effect before the end of that period, until that new edition takes effect.
114B
The NHS payment scheme: enforcement
Where the commissioner of a service fails to comply with rules contained in the NHS payment scheme, NHS England may direct the commissioner to take steps specified in the direction, within a period specified in the direction—
(a)
to secure that the failure does not continue or recur, or
(b)
to secure that the position is (so far as practicable) restored to what it would have been if the failure was not occurring or had not occurred.
114C
The NHS payment scheme: impact assessment and consultation
(1)
Before publishing the NHS payment scheme, NHS England must—
(a)
carry out an assessment of the likely impact of the proposed scheme, or
(b)
publish a statement setting out its reasons for concluding that such assessment is not needed.
(2)
Before publishing the NHS payment scheme, NHS England must consult the following—
(a)
each integrated care board;
(b)
each relevant provider;
(c)
such other persons as NHS England considers appropriate.
(3)
NHS England must give those persons a notice—
(a)
describing the proposed NHS payment scheme,
(b)
setting out any impact assessment carried out under subsection (1)(a), and
(c)
specifying when the period within which representations may be made about the proposed NHS payment scheme (“the consultation period”) will come to an end.
(4)
The consultation period is the period of 28 days beginning with the day after that on which the notice is published.
(5)
NHS England must publish the notice given under subsection (2).
(6)
If, having consulted under this section—
(a)

NHS England must consult again under this section.
(7)
Subsection (6) does not apply where section 114D applies.
(8)
In this section “relevant provider” means—
(a)
a licence holder, or
(b)
another person, of a prescribed description, that provides—
(i)
health care services for the purposes of the NHS, or

services in pursuance of arrangements made by NHS England or an integrated care board by virtue of section 7A or 7B of the National Health Service Act 2006 (Secretary of State’s public health functions).
114D
Objections to proposed NHS payment scheme
(1)
This section applies where—
(a)
within the consultation period under section 114C, NHS England receives objections to the proposed NHS payment scheme from one or more integrated care boards or relevant providers, and
(b)
either or both of the following apply—
(i)
the objection percentage for integrated care boards exceeds the prescribed percentage;
(ii)

(3)
NHS England must consult such persons as appear to NHS England to be representative of the integrated care boards or relevant providers from whom objections were received.
(4)
If, having complied with subsection (3)—
(a)
NHS England decides to make amendments of the proposed NHS payment scheme that are, in its opinion, significant, and
(b)
it would, in NHS England’s opinion, be unfair to make the amendments without further consultation,
NHS England must consult again under section 114C.
(5)
If, having complied with subsection (3), NHS England decides not to amend the proposed NHS payment scheme, it may publish the scheme but, before doing so, must—
(a)
publish a notice stating that decision and setting out the reasons for it, and
(b)
send a copy of the notice to—
(i)
the persons consulted under subsection (3), and
(ii)
the integrated care boards or relevant providers from whom objections were received.
114E
Amendments of the NHS payment scheme
(1)
NHS England may amend the NHS payment scheme during the period for which it has effect, provided that, in the opinion of NHS England, the amendments are not so significant as to require publication of a new edition of the NHS payment scheme.
(2)
In deciding whether the amendments are so significant as to require the publication of a new edition of the NHS payment scheme, NHS England must have regard to—
(a)
the proportion of integrated care boards that would be affected by the proposed amendments;
(b)
the proportion of relevant providers that would be affected by the proposed amendments;
(c)
the impact that the proposed amendments would have on integrated care boards and relevant providers that would be affected by them;
(d)
whether any integrated care boards or relevant providers would be disproportionately affected by the proposed amendments;

such other persons as NHS England considers appropriate.

(a)
the proposed amendments, and

(6)
The consultation period is the period of 28 days beginning with the day after that on which the notice is published.
(7)
NHS England must send a copy of the notice to each of the persons to be consulted under subsection (4).
114F
Interpretation
In this Chapter—
“commissioner”, in relation to a service, means the person who arranges for the provision of the service;
“the NHS payment scheme” means the document published under section 114A(1);
“relevant provider” has the meaning given by section 114C(8).”

(b)
P’s consent to the storage of the gametes is required under paragraph 8(1),
(c)
there is effective consent from P to the storage of the gametes, and
(d)
the gametes are being kept for use for the purposes of providing treatment services to—
(i)
P, or
(ii)
P and another person together.
(2)
The person keeping the gametes in storage (“K”) must, in each consent period, request P to renew consent to storage of the gametes within the renewal period.
For the meaning of “consent period” and “renewal period”, see paragraph 11B.
(3)
A request under sub-paragraph (2) must be given in writing before the start of the renewal period.
(4)
The duty in sub-paragraph (2) ceases to apply if K is notified that P has died.
(5)
The duty in sub-paragraph (2) does not apply in relation to any consent period if—
(a)
K has at any time been informed in writing that P has been certified as lacking capacity to renew consent to storage of the gametes, and
(b)
K has not subsequently been informed in writing, before the start of the renewal period which relates to that consent period, that P has been certified as having capacity to renew consent to storage of the gametes.
(6)
P renews consent by informing K in writing that P consents to the storage of the gametes.
(7)
If P’s consent is not renewed under sub-paragraph (6) before the end of the consent period, K must, as soon as possible after the end of that period, give a notice to P stating that if P does not renew consent before the end of the renewal period, the gametes will be removed from storage and disposed of.
(8)
P’s consent to the storage of the gametes is to be taken as having been withdrawn at the end of a renewal period that relates to a consent period if—
(a)
K has complied with the requirements of sub-paragraphs (2) and (7) in relation to that consent period, and
(b)
P’s consent is not renewed under sub-paragraph (6) before the end of the renewal period.
But this is subject to sub-paragraphs (9) and (10).
(9)
If, in a case referred to in sub-paragraph (8)(a) and (b), P dies before the end of the renewal period—
(a)
P’s consent is not to be taken as withdrawn under sub-paragraph (8), but
(b)
if at the end of the period of 10 years beginning with the day on which P died there is still effective consent from P to the storage, P’s consent is to be taken as withdrawn at that time.
(10)
If, in a case referred to in sub-paragraph (8)(a) and (b), before the end of the renewal period P is certified as lacking capacity to renew consent—
(a)
P’s consent is not to be taken as withdrawn under sub-paragraph (8), but
(b)
if at the end of the period of 10 years beginning with the day on which P was so certified there is still effective consent from P to the storage, P’s consent is to be taken as withdrawn at that time.
(11)
But P’s consent is not to be taken as withdrawn under sub-paragraph (10)(b) if, before the time it would be taken to be withdrawn under that sub-paragraph—
(a)
P is certified as having capacity to renew consent to storage of the gametes, and
(b)
P renews consent to storage of the gametes by informing K in writing that P consents to their storage.
(12)
In a case where P renews consent under sub-paragraph (11)(b), this paragraph applies subsequently as if references to a consent period were to—
(a)
the period of 10 years beginning with the day on which P so renewed consent, and
(b)
each successive period of 10 years.
11B
(1)
For the purposes of paragraph 11A, each of the following is a “consent period”—
(a)
the period of 10 years beginning with the relevant day, and
(b)
each successive period of 10 years.
(2)
In sub-paragraph (1)(a) “relevant day” means—
(a)
the day on which the gametes are first placed in storage, or
(b)
in a case where sub-paragraph (3) or (5) applies, the day on which P gives consent to the storage of the gametes.
(3)
This sub-paragraph applies where the gametes are taken from or provided by P before P attains the age of 18 years and, at the time the gametes are first stored—
(a)
P has not attained the age of 16 years and is not competent to deal with the issue of consent to storage of the gametes, or
(b)
P has attained that age but, although not lacking capacity to consent to the storage of the gametes, is not competent to deal with the issue of consent to their storage.
(4)
In relation to Scotland, sub-paragraph (3) is to be read as if, for paragraphs (a) and (b), there were substituted “P does not have capacity (within the meaning of section 2(4) of the Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) Act 1991) to consent to storage of the gametes”.
(5)
This sub-paragraph applies where the gametes are taken from or provided by P after P attains the age of 16 years and, at the time the gametes are first stored, P lacks capacity to consent to their storage.
(6)
In paragraph 11A “the renewal period”, in relation to a consent period, means the period which—
(a)
begins 12 months before the end of the consent period, and
(b)
ends 6 months after the end of the consent period.
(7)
In paragraph 11A “certified” means certified in writing by a registered medical practitioner.
(8)
In paragraph 11A and this paragraph, in relation to Scotland, references to a person lacking or having capacity to consent or renew consent are to be read as references to the person being or not being incapable (within the meaning of section 1(6) of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000) of consenting or renewing consent.

11C
(1)
This paragraph applies where—
(a)
an embryo, the creation of which was brought about in vitro, is in storage,
(b)
the embryo is being kept for use for the purposes of providing treatment services to—
(i)
a person (“P”) whose gametes or human cells were used to bring about the creation of the embryo, or
(ii)
P and another person together,
(c)
P’s consent to the storage of the embryo is required under paragraph 8(2), and
(d)
there is effective consent from P to the storage of the embryo.
(2)
The person keeping the embryo in storage (“K”) must, in each consent period, request P to renew consent to storage of the embryo within the renewal period.
For the meaning of “consent period” and “renewal period”, see paragraph 11D.
(3)
A request under sub-paragraph (2) must be given in writing before the start of the renewal period.
(4)
The duty in sub-paragraph (2) ceases to apply if—
(a)
K is notified that P has died, or
(b)
K is notified under paragraph 4A(1)(c) of the withdrawal of a person’s consent to storage of the embryo.
(5)
The duty in sub-paragraph (2) does not apply in relation to any consent period if—
(a)
K has at any time been informed in writing that P has been certified as lacking capacity to renew consent to storage of the embryo, and
(b)
K has not subsequently been informed in writing, before the start of the renewal period which relates to that consent period, that P has been certified as having capacity to renew consent to storage of the embryo.
(6)
P renews consent by informing K in writing that P consents to the storage of the embryo.
(7)
If P’s consent is not renewed under sub-paragraph (6) before the end of the consent period, K must, as soon as possible after the end of that period, give a notice to P stating that if P does not renew consent before the end of the renewal period, the embryo will be removed from storage and disposed of.
(8)
P’s consent to the storage of the embryo is to be taken as having been withdrawn at the end of a renewal period that relates to a consent period if—
(a)
K has complied with the requirements of sub-paragraphs (2) and (7) in relation to that consent period, and
(b)
P’s consent is not renewed under sub-paragraph (6) before the end of the renewal period.
But this is subject to sub-paragraphs (9) and (10).
(9)
If, in a case referred to in sub-paragraph (8)(a) and (b), P dies before the end of the renewal period—

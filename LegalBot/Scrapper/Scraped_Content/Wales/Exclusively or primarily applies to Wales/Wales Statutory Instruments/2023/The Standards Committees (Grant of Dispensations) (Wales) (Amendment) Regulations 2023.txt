12 September 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 1(3) of the Standards Committees (Grant of Dispensations) (Wales) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/2279 (W.169)) (“the 2001 Regulations”) to add corporate joint committees established under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (asc 1) to the definition of “relevant authority”.
The 2001 Regulations set out the procedure for granting dispensations from prohibitions in the code of conduct for members or co-opted members of the standards committees of relevant authorities.
These Regulations are connected with regulations which established certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021. The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected orders and regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment was prepared at the time of making those establishment regulations and is relied upon for the purpose of these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations set a revised date for the end of the period during which the revised versions of the registers of local government electors in Wales, for the year 2024, must be published by registration officers under section 13(1)(a) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act”).
Regulation 2(1) applies to the publication by a registration officer (see section 8 of the 1983 Act) for a county or county borough area in Wales of the revised register of local government electors maintained by that officer under section 9(1)(b) of the 1983 Act.
Regulation 2(2) sets the date by which that register must be published as 1 February 2025.
To ensure consistency in the publication of the electoral registers in Wales, the Representation of the People (Franchise Amendment and Eligibility Review) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1150) prescribe the date of 1 February 2025 for the publication by registration officers of the revised versions of the registers of United Kingdom parliamentary electors maintained for areas in Wales, for the year 2024, under section 9(1)(a) of the 1983 Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations as they implement a technical amendment which has no impact, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors.

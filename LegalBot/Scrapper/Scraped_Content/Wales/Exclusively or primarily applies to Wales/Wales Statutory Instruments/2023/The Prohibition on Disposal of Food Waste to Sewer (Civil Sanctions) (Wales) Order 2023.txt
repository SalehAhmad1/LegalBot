(This note is not part of this Order)
This Order makes provision in relation to the prohibition on the disposal of food waste to sewer under section 34D of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as inserted by section 66(1) of the Environment (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 3)). Breach of this prohibition is an offence under section 34D(3) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (c. 43).
A civil sanctions regime is introduced to enable the regulator to impose fixed monetary penalties, variable monetary penalties and non-compliance penalties (article 5 and paragraphs 1, 11 and 19 of the Schedule). The regulator, for the purposes of this Order, is the local authority for the area in which the premises are situated.
This Order makes provision for the procedure relating to the civil sanctions, including appeals. Appeals under this Order are to the First-tier Tribunal.
The Schedule to this Order (paragraphs 25 to 27) provides that guidance relating to the use of civil sanctions must be published. Guidance must also be published relating to the use of non-compliance penalties and enforcement cost recovery notices (paragraph 26). Before any guidance is published, the regulator is required to consult (paragraph 27). This Order also provides for the publication of information on enforcement action taken by the regulator (paragraph 28 of the Schedule). The regulator is able to recover certain costs of enforcement (paragraph 22 of the Schedule) in the case of variable monetary penalties.
The regulator is able to recover any fixed monetary penalty, variable monetary penalty or non-compliance penalty imposed by the regulator under this Order together with any financial penalty for late payment (paragraph 29 of the Schedule).
Article 6 gives enforcement officers powers of investigation in relation to potential offences, including powers of entry and seizure.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order. A copy can be obtained from the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff CF10 3NQ and on the Welsh Government website at www.gov.wales.

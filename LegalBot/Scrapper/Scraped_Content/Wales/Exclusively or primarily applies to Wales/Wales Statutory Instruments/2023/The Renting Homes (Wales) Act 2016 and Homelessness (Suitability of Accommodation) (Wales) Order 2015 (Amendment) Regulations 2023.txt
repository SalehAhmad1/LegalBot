28 November 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Schedule 2 (exceptions to section 7) to the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 1) (“the Act”), make a consequential amendment to section 243(3) of the Act and amend the definition of “B&B accommodation” in the Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (Wales) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/1268 (W. 87)) (“the Order”).
Regulation 2(2) amends Schedule 2 to the Act. Regulation 2(2)(a)(i) inserts a new paragraph 7(3)(l) into Part 3 of that Schedule. This provides that a licence relating to private sector temporary homelessness accommodation (as defined), is never an occupation contract.
Regulation 2(2)(a)(ii) inserts a new paragraph 10A into Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Act which provides a definition of private sector temporary homelessness accommodation.
Regulation 2(2)(b) amends paragraph 12(1), in Part 4 of Schedule 2 to the Act, to make it clear that paragraph 12 does not apply to a licence of the kind described in the newly inserted paragraph 7(3)(l) of Schedule 2.
Regulation 2(3) amends section 243(3) of the Act to make it clear that the definition of “local housing authority” set out in that section does not apply in relation to the newly inserted paragraph 7(3)(l) of Schedule 2.
Prior to the coming into force of these Regulations, occupation contracts are prevented from arising in relation to private sector temporary homelessness accommodation, by virtue of regulation 16 of the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (Saving and Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1172 (W. 242)).
Regulation 3 amends the definition of “B&B accommodation” in article 2 of the Order, to more clearly reflect the characteristics of that accommodation.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

SCHEDULE
Regulations 4A and 4B
“SCHEDULE 1A
Enhanced nutrient management requirements
Application of Schedule 1A
1.  The following enhanced nutrient management requirements apply to the occupier of a qualifying grassland holding intending during the relevant period to apply to the holding, whether directly by an animal or by spreading, a total amount of nitrogen in grazing livestock manure which exceeds 170 kg multiplied by the area of the holding in hectares.
Interpretation
2.  In this Schedule—
“soil phosphorus index” (“mynegai ffosfforws pridd”) means a reference to the index number assigned to the soil in accordance with Table 1 of this Schedule, to indicate the level of phosphorus available from the soil;“soil sampling analysis” (“dadansoddiad samplu pridd”) means analysis of a soil sample carried out by a soil testing laboratory to analyse soils for phosphorus.
Livestock manure to be applied to the holding during relevant period
3.  The occupier must ensure that the only livestock manure to be applied to the holding during the relevant period, whether directly by an animal or by spreading, is manure produced by the livestock on the holding.
Soil sampling analysis
4.—(1) The occupier must, for the purposes of determining the soil phosphorus index for each area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type, undertake soil sampling analysis of at least every five hectares of the agricultural area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type.
(2) An occupier may rely on the results of previous soil sampling analysis of the agricultural area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), provided such sampling analysis was carried out within the period beginning with 1 January 2020 and ending with 31 December 2023.
(3) Where phosphorus soil sampling analysis of the agricultural area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type has not been carried out within the period referred to in sub-paragraph (2), such sampling analysis must be undertaken within the period beginning with 1 January 2024 and ending with 30 March 2024.
Determining the soil phosphorus index
5.  The occupier must determine the soil phosphorus index for each area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type by using the results from the soil sampling analysis under paragraph 4 and the values in the following table.
Table 1 – Phosphorus index

Planning the spreading of phosphate fertiliser
6.  In addition to the production of nitrogen spreading plans under regulation 6 (planning the spreading of nitrogen fertiliser) the occupier must, within the period beginning with 1 January 2024 and ending with 30 March 2024—
(a)
calculate the optimum amount of phosphate fertiliser (kg) that should be spread on the crop during the relevant period, taking into account the soil phosphorus index, and
(b)
produce a plan (“enhanced nutrient management plan”) for the spreading of phosphate fertiliser during the relevant period.
Requirements for enhanced nutrient management plans
7.—(1) The enhanced nutrient management plan for the holding must—
(a)
include a risk map, produced in accordance with paragraph 11(1), indicating the location of the fields to which the plan relates, and
(b)
clearly state in relation to any field referred to in the plan the type of fertiliser to be used.
(2) The enhanced nutrient management plan must record—
(a)
the soil phosphorus index for each area of the holding with the same cropping regime, nutrient management regime and soil type,
(b)
the optimum amount of phosphate fertiliser (kg) that should be spread on the crop, taking into account the soil phosphorus index,
(c)
the amount of nitrogen (kg) likely to be available for uptake by the crop from any organic manure intended to be spread for crop uptake in the growing season during the relevant period,
(d)
the amount of phosphate (kg) likely to be supplied to meet the requirement of the crop from any organic manure spread or intended to be spread during the relevant period, calculated in accordance with—
(i)
tables 1 and 2 (as applicable) of Schedule 1,
(ii)
sampling and analysis in accordance with Part 2 of Schedule 3, or
(iii)
technical analyses provided by the supplier,
(e)
the amount of manufactured nitrogen fertiliser (kg) required (that is, the optimum amount of nitrogen required by the crop less the amount of nitrogen that will be available for crop uptake from any organic manure spread during the relevant period), and
(f)
the amount of manufactured phosphate fertiliser (kg) required (that is, the optimum amount of phosphate required by the crop less the amount of phosphate supplied for crop uptake from any organic manure spread for the purpose of fertilising the crop during the relevant period).
Total phosphorus spread on a holding during relevant period
8.  Irrespective of the figure recorded in the enhanced nutrient management plan in accordance with paragraph 7(2)(b), the occupier must ensure that the total amount of—
(a)
phosphate from manufactured phosphate fertiliser, and
(b)
phosphate from organic manure, in the growing season in which it is spread,
does not, during the relevant period, exceed the limits set out in paragraph 9.

e-mail: NotificationENMA@cyfoethnaturiolcymru.gov.ukEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Water Resources (Control of Agricultural Pollution) (Wales) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/77 (W. 20)) (“the 2021 Regulations”).
Regulation 3 amends regulation 2 (transitional measures for holdings not previously in a nitrate vulnerable zone) of the 2021 Regulations. It changes the implementation date for regulation 4 (application of livestock manure – total nitrogen limit for the whole holding) for holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within a nitrate vulnerable zone (“NVZ”) as shown on the NVZ index map, where 80% or more of the agricultural area is sown with grass (“qualifying grassland holdings”) from 1 January 2024 to 1 January 2025. This means that the total nitrogen limit in livestock manure for the whole holding (170kg multiplied by the area of the holding in hectares) in regulation 4 of the 2021 Regulations does not apply to qualifying grassland holdings until 1 January 2025.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 3 (interpretation) of the 2021 Regulations by inserting definitions of the terms “enhanced nutrient management plan”, “precision spreading equipment”, “qualifying grassland holding” and “relevant period”. It also substitutes a definition of “NRW” for “NRBW”.
Regulation 5 inserts new regulations 4A and 4B into the 2021 Regulations. Regulation 4A (application of grazing and non-grazing livestock manure on qualifying grassland holdings during the relevant period) requires the occupier of a qualifying grassland holding to ensure that for the calendar year 2024 (“the relevant period”) the area of the holding (in hectares) is greater than or equal to the sum of the total amount of nitrogen in grazing livestock manure applied to the holding divided by 250, plus the total amount of nitrogen in non-grazing livestock manure applied to the holding divided by 170. The purpose of this calculation is to limit the total amount of nitrogen in livestock manure that an occupier of a qualifying grassland holding is permitted to apply to the holding, whether directly by an animal or by spreading, during the relevant period. It ensures that where an occupier of a qualifying grassland holding is only applying grazing livestock manure to the holding, they must not apply more than 250kg of nitrogen in grazing livestock manure per hectare during the relevant period. It also ensures that where an occupier of a qualifying grassland holding is only applying non-grazing livestock manure to the holding, they must not apply more than 170kg of nitrogen in non-grazing livestock manure per hectare during the relevant period. Where an occupier of a qualifying grassland holding is applying both grazing and non-grazing livestock manures to the holding during the relevant period, the calculation also makes provision for the application of both to be adjusted on a pro-rata basis.
Regulation 4A(2) provides that where an occupier of a qualifying grassland holding intends to apply to the holding during the relevant period, a total amount of nitrogen in grazing livestock manure which exceeds 170kg multiplied by the area of the holding in hectares, they must comply with additional enhanced nutrient management requirements established under Schedule 1A (enhanced nutrient management requirements) and notify Natural Resources Wales (“NRW”). Regulation 4B (notice requirements) sets out the notice requirements that the occupier of a qualifying grassland holding must comply with when notifying NRW.
Regulation 6 makes minor amendments to regulation 14 (spreading organic manure near surface water, boreholes, springs or wells) of the 2021 Regulations to assist with clarity.
Regulation 7 replaces references to “NRBW with references to “NRW” wherever they occur in the Regulations. This is in consequence of replacing the definition of “NRBW” with “NRW” under regulation 3.
Regulation 8 inserts a new Schedule 1A (enhanced nutrient management requirements) into the 2021 Regulations which sets out the additional enhanced nutrient management requirements to be met by an occupier of a qualifying grassland holding if the occupier intends, during the relevant period, to apply to the holding a total amount of nitrogen in grazing livestock manure which exceeds 170kg multiplied by the area of the holding in hectares.
Regulation 9 revokes the Water Resources (Control of Agricultural Pollution) (Wales) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2023.

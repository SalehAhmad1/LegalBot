(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Local Government Officers (Political Restrictions) Regulations 1990 (S.I. 1990/851) (“the 1990 Regulations”) impose restrictions on the public political activities of local government officers who are appointed to or employed in posts which are politically restricted posts for the purposes of Part 1 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (c. 42) (“the 1989 Act”). The restrictions take the form of terms and conditions that are deemed to be incorporated into those officers’ terms of appointment and conditions of employment (“the restrictions”).
These Regulations add corporate joint committees established by regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (asc 1) (“CJCs”) to the 1990 Regulations to impose the restrictions on the public political activities of officers of CJCs who are the holders of politically restricted posts in Wales for the purposes of Part 1 of the 1989 Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected regulations and orders. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment was prepared at the time of making those establishment regulations and is relied on for the purpose of these Regulations.

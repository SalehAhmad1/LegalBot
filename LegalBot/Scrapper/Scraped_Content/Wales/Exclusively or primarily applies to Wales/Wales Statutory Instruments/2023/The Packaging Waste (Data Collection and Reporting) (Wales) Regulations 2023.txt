(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations impose requirements on producers who are established in Wales to collect data on the packaging they supply to others, and, in some cases, to report some of that information to Natural Resources Wales.
Part 1 contains the interpretation and general provisions for the instrument.
Part 2 sets out the obligations on producers. Schedule 1 identifies the information which producers are required to collect and report on.
Part 3 makes provision for registered schemes and exempts producers who are members of a registered scheme from their data reporting obligations under these Regulations, provided that they satisfy the requirements in regulation 19(2). Registered schemes are required to make reports on behalf of each of their members who satisfy these requirements. Part 3 also makes provision in relation to changes to the membership of a scheme in the middle of a relevant year.
Part 4 sets out the powers and duties of Natural Resources Wales under these Regulations.
Part 5 provides for a number of offences and penalties for breach of the requirements imposed by these Regulations. These Regulations are enforced by Natural Resources Wales.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

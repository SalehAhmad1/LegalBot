The Welsh Ministers are designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972(1) in relation to measures relating to the requirement for an assessment of the impact on the environment of projects likely to have significant effects on the environment(2).
The Welsh Ministers make these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of that Act.

1972 c. 68. The European Communities Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”) was repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (“the 2018 Act”) with effect from exit day. “Exit day” is defined in section 20 of the 2018 Act as 31 January 2020 at 11pm.

4 December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”) which primarily implement Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 (OJ No L 26, 28.1.2012, p. 1) on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (“the EIA Directive”) in relation to two types of project in paragraph 1 of Annex II to that Directive: projects for the restructuring of rural land holdings and projects for the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agricultural purposes. The 2017 Regulations make provision for the amendments to the EIA Directive effected by Directive 2014/52/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 (OJ No L 124, 25.4.2014, p. 1).
Regulation 2 amends regulation 3 of the 2017 Regulations, which sets out the types of projects that are excluded from the scope of those Regulations. The amendment removes the exemption for restricted works on common land in regulation 3(2)(f) of the 2017 Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely cost and benefit of complying with these Regulations.

1 December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/871) in relation to Wales. Those Regulations impose on producers the obligation to recover and recycle packaging waste in order to attain the recovery and recycling targets set out in Article 6(1) of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (OJ No L 365, 31.12.94, p. 10).
These Regulations replace the EU recovery and recycling targets with recycling targets on producers. They also vary the material specific recycling targets on obligated producers for paper, plastic, glass, aluminium, steel and wood as well as the specific re-melt target for glass. The recycling allocation for small producers for 2018 to 2020 is changed for 2021 and 2022.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

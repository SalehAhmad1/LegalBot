10 November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
In particular, these Regulations make amendments to the Fisheries and Marine Management (Amendment) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/370) (W. 91)) which make amendments to subordinate legislation, which apply in relation to Wales and the Welsh zone, in the fields of fisheries and marine management.
These Regulations make provision under paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in order to correct an error within regulation 3 of the Fisheries and Marine Management (Amendment) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, concerning amendments made to the Marine Licensing (Exempted Activities) (Wales) Order 2011 (S.I. 2011/559 (W. 81)).
These Regulations also make provision substituting the corrections made by regulation 4 of the Fisheries and Marine Management (Amendment) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, concerning amendments made to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (Grants) (Wales) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/665 (W. 182)), in order to reflect the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

Approved by Senedd Cymru
Made

Laid before the National Assembly for Wales
29 April 2020
Coming into force
30 April 2020
The Welsh Ministers, in exercise of the powers conferred on them by Articles 69(1) and 70(4) of Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy(1) make the following Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers consider that, in order to resolve problems arising from flooding in Wales, it is necessary and justifiable to derogate from the provisions in that Regulation for claim year 2020 as respects crop diversification requirements, the extent and period of that derogation being in the Welsh Ministers’ opinion, strictly necessary.
(1)
Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No. 637/2008 and Council Regulation (EC) No. 73/2009 (OJ No L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 608). Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013, has been incorporated into domestic law by virtue of section 1 of the Direct Payments to Farmers (Legislative Continuity) Act 2020 (c. 2) but only for claim year 2020 (see section 1(2)(a) of that Act and section 1(7) of that Act for the definition of “claim year”). The Act also incorporated other EU legislation relating to the CAP direct payment scheme but they are not relevant to these Regulations. The Direct Payments to Farmers (Legislative Continuity) Act 2020 provides the legal basis to continue paying direct payments to farmers for claim year 2020 (Article 137 of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union (19 October 2019) provided that Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 does not apply to the UK for claim year 2020). Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 has been amended by regulations 2, 3(4) and 7 of the Rules for Direct Payments to Farmers (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/91). The amendments made by the Regulations addressed the failures in Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. In particular, the Regulations amended Article 69(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 so that the power to make derogations is exercisable by the Welsh Ministers (see Article 4(1)(r) and (s) of Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 for the definitions of “relevant authority” and “appropriate authority”). There are other amendments to Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 but they are not relevant to these Regulations.Title, commencement, application and interpretation

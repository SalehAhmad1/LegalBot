Regulation (EU) No. 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No. 352/78, (EC) No. 165/94, (EC) No. 2799/98, (EC) No. 814/2000, (EC) No. 1290/2005 and (EC) No. 485/2008 (OJ No L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 549). In so far as relating to the CAP direct payment schemes for claim year 2020, Regulation (EU) No. 1306/2013, has been incorporated into domestic law by virtue of section 1 of the Direct Payments to Farmers (Legislative Continuity) Act 2020 (c. 2) (see footnote for Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 below for discussion about how the direct payment scheme for claim year 2020 has been incorporated into domestic legislation). Article 78(b) of Regulation (EU) No. 1306/2013 has been amended by regulation 7(16)(b) of the Financing, Management and Monitoring of Direct Payments to Farmers (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/90). In particular, the function in Article 78(b) has been amended so that it is exercisable by the Welsh Ministers (see Article 2(1)(k) and (m) of Regulation (EU) No. 1306/2013 for the definitions of “relevant authority” and “appropriate authority”). There are other amendments to Regulation (EU) No. 1306/2013 but they are not relevant to these Regulations.

Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No. 637/2008 and Council Regulation (EC) No. 73/2009 (OJ No L 347, 20.12.2013, p. 608). Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 has been incorporated into domestic law by section 1 of the Direct Payments to Farmers (Legislative Continuity) Act 2020 (c. 2), but only for claim year 2020 (see section 1(2)(a) of that Act and section 1(7) of that Act for the definition of “claim year”).The Direct Payment to Farmers (Legislative Continuity) Act 2020 provides the legal basis to continue paying direct payments to farmers for claim year 2020 (Article 137 of the Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union (19 October 2019) provided that Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 does not apply to the UK for claim year 2020. Article 34(5) of Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 has been amended by regulation 5 of the Rules for Direct Payments to Farmers (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/91). The amendments made by the Regulations addressed the failures in Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. In particular, the Regulations amended Article 34(5) of Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 so that the power to lay down the rules governing the notification by farmers of transfers of entitlements is exerciseable by the Welsh Ministers (see Article 4(1)(r) and (s) of Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 for the definitions of “relevant authority” and “appropriate authority”). There are other amendments to Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 but they are not relevant to these Regulations.Title, commencement, application and interpretation

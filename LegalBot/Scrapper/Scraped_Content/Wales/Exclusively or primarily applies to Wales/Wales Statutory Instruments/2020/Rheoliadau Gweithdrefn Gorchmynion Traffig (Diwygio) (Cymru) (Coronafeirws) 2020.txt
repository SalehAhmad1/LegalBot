O.S. 1990/1656. Mae diwygiadau nad ydynt yn berthnasol.Ken Skates
Gweinidog yr Economi, Trafnidiaeth a Gogledd Cymru, un o Weinidogion Cymru
23 Gorffennaf 2020NODYN ESBONIADOL
(Nid yw’r nodyn hwn yn rhan o’r Rheoliadau)
Mae’r Rheoliadau hyn yn gwneud darpariaeth mewn cysylltiad â gorchmynion traffig penodol a wnaed a hysbysiadau a roddwyd yng Nghymru, o dan Ddeddf Rheoleiddio Traffig Ffyrdd 1984. Cânt eu cyflwyno fel mesur brys mewn ymateb i effeithiau’r coronafeirws.
Maent yn diwygio’r weithdrefn ar gyfer gwneud gorchmynion traffig a rhoi hysbysiadau drwy ddarparu dull amgen o roi cyhoeddusrwydd i orchmynion o dan amgylchiadau pan na fo’n rhesymol ymarferol i ddilyn y gofynion cyhoeddusrwydd presennol o ganlyniad i’r coronafeirws. Maent hefyd yn symleiddio’r weithdrefn ar gyfer gwneud gorchmynion traffig dros dro a wneir at ddibenion sy’n gysylltiedig â’r coronafeirws.
Mae’r Rheoliadau hyn yn diwygio—
(a)
Rheoliadau Gweithdrefn Traffig Ffyrdd (Cyfyngiadau Dros Dro) 1992 (“Rheoliadau 1992”);
(b)
Rheoliadau Gorchmynion Traffig Awdurdodau Lleol (Gweithdrefn) (Cymru a Lloegr) 1996 (“Rheoliadau 1996”); ac
(c)
Rheoliadau Gorchmynion Traffig yr Ysgrifennydd Gwladol (Gweithdrefn) (Cymru a Lloegr) 1990 (“Rheoliadau 1990”).
Mae rheoliad 2 yn diwygio Rheoliadau 1992, sy’n nodi gweithdrefnau mewn cysylltiad â’r broses o wneud gorchmynion traffig dros dro a rhoi hysbysiadau drwy fewnosod Rhan 7 newydd yn y Rheoliadau hynny (mewnosod rheoliadau 22 i 27 newydd). Mae’r rheoliad 23 newydd yn ymwneud â’r gofynion cyhoeddusrwydd ar gyfer gorchmynion a hysbysiadau rheoleiddio traffig. Mae’r diwygiadau yn rhoi’r dewis i awdurdod traffig i ddefnyddio trefniadau amgen ar gyfer rhoi cyhoeddusrwydd i hysbysiad sy’n ymwneud â gorchymyn traffig, pan na fo’n rhesymol ymarferol i gyhoeddi mewn papur newydd sy’n cylchredeg yn yr ardal, neu i arddangos hysbysiadau ar safle, am resymau sy’n gysylltiedig ag effeithiau’r coronafeirws, gan gynnwys cyfyngiadau symud.
Mae’r rheoliad 24 newydd yn ymwneud â gorchmynion traffig dros dro a wneir at ddibenion sy’n gysylltiedig â’r coronafeirws. Mae gweithdrefn symlach yn gymwys i’r broses o wneud gorchmynion sy’n dod o fewn y diben hwn.
Mae rheoliad 3 yn diwygio Rheoliadau 1996, sy’n nodi gweithdrefnau ar gyfer gwneud gorchmynion traffig parhaol ac arbrofol, drwy fewnosod Rhan 7 newydd yn y Rheoliadau hynny (gan fewnosod rheoliadau 30 i 33 newydd). Mae’r diwygiadau yn rhoi’r dewis i awdurdod sy’n gwneud gorchymyn i ddefnyddio trefniadau amgen ar gyfer rhoi cyhoeddusrwydd i hysbysiad sy’n ymwneud â gorchymyn traffig, pan na fo’n rhesymol ymarferol i gyhoeddi mewn papur newydd sy’n cylchredeg yn yr ardal am resymau sy’n gysylltiedig ag effeithiau’r coronafeirws, gan gynnwys cyfyngiadau symud. Maent hefyd yn caniatáu i awdurdod traffig ddefnyddio dull amgen o wneud dogfennau ar gael i’r cyhoedd, pan na fo’n rhesymol ymarferol i wneud dogfennau ar gael i’w harchwilio mewn cyfeiriad penodol, am resymau sy’n gysylltiedig ag effeithiau’r coronafeirws.
Mae rheoliad 4 yn diwygio Rheoliadau 1990, sy’n nodi gweithdrefnau ar gyfer gorchmynion traffig penodol a wneir gan Weinidogion Cymru mewn cysylltiad â chefnffyrdd a ffyrdd gwledig, a gorchmynion o dan bwerau wrth gefn Gweinidogion Cymru yn Atodlen 9 i Ddeddf 1984. Mae’r diwygiadau hyn yn cael yr un effaith â’r diwygiadau a wnaed i Reoliadau 1996.
Bydd y diwygiadau a wneir gan y Rheoliadau hyn yn peidio â chael effaith ar ddiwedd 31 Gorffennaf 2021. Mae’r Rheoliadau hyn yn darparu ar gyfer darpariaethau trosiannol er mwyn cynnal parhad ar ôl i’r diwygiadau ddod i ben.
Ystyriwyd Cod Ymarfer Gweinidogion Cymru ar gynnal Asesiadau Effaith Rheoleiddiol mewn perthynas â’r Rheoliadau hyn. Ni luniwyd asesiad effaith rheoleiddiol ar gyfer yr offeryn hwn gan fod angen rhoi’r Rheoliadau mewn grym yn gyflym er mwyn delio ag argyfwng sy’n gysylltiedig ag effeithiau’r coronafeirws.

These Regulations replace the Official Controls (Animals, Food and Feed) (Wales) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/196 (W.15)) and substantially amend the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Wales) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/2379 (W. 252)).
These Regulations implement and enforce Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (OJ No. L 95, 7.4.2017, p. 1) on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (“the EU Regulation”).
Implementation and enforcement of other provisions of the EU Regulation relating to food and feed are the subject of the Official Feed and Food Controls (Wales) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/3376) (W. 298).
Implementation and enforcement of provisions relating to plant health and protective measures against plant pests will be the subject of a separate instrument.

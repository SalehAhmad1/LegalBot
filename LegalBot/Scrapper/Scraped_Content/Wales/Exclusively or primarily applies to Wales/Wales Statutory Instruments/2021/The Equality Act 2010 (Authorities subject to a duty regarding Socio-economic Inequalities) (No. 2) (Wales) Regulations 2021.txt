(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are connected with Regulations which establish certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021.
Section 1 of the Equality Act 2010 (“the 2010 Act”) provides the list of authorities that are subject to a public sector duty regarding socio-economic inequalities (“the duty”). The Welsh Ministers may, under section 2(4)(a) of the 2010 Act, add a relevant authority to the list of authorities that are subject to the duty. “Relevant authority” means a devolved Welsh authority (within the meaning given by section 157A of the Government of Wales Act 2006) whose functions correspond or are similar to those of an authority for the time being specified in subsection (3) or referred to in subsection (4) of section 1 of the 2010 Act.
These Regulations exercise the power in section 2(4)(a) of the 2010 Act to amend section 1 of that Act in order to add corporate joint committees to the list of relevant authorities subject to the duty.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the Regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

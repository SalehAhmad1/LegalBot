12 March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are connected to Part 2 of the Official Controls and Phytosanitary Conditions (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/136), elements of which apply to Wales. Those Regulations made provision to supplement Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls and other official activities (“the Official Controls Regulation”). Specifically, they supplemented and modified the transitional derogations and modifications set out in Article 168 of, and Annex 6 to, the Official Controls Regulation, by providing for official controls that are carried out on certain goods listed in the Schedule to those Regulations to be carried out at the place of destination.
These Regulations make connected amendments to provisions relating to offences in the Official Controls (Plant Health and Genetically Modified Organisms) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/206) (W. 48) to include inspections at the place of destination within the existing enforcement framework.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

8 December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of powers conferred by the European Union (Future Relationship) Act 2020 (c. 29). They implement Article 5 of Annex 15 to the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“the TCA”). Annex 15 to the TCA makes provision for trade in wine and Article 5 provides for transitional measures relating to the labelling and placing on the market of wine produced before the date of entry into force of the TCA. Regulation 2 makes consequential amendments to the Food Information (Wales) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2303) (W. 227) to ensure such wine can continue to be sold.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

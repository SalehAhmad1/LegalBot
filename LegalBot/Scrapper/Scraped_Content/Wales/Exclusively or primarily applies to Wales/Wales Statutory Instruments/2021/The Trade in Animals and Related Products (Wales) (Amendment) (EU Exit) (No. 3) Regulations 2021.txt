27 September 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations amend deficiencies in the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Wales) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/2379) (W. 252) (‘the 2011 Regulations’) as a consequence of EU Exit. Regulation 2 amends Schedule 5 of the 2011 Regulations to change the date from which the transitional prior notification requirements for products of animal origin apply from 1 October 2021 to 1 January 2022 and to remove the requirement for products of animal origin and animal by-products to be accompanied by the appropriate health certificate for third country imports before the end of the transitional staging period.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

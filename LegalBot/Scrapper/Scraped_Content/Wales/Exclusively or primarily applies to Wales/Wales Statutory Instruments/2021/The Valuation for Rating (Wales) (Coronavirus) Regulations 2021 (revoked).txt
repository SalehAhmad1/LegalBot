(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations specify the assumptions that are to be made when applying the provisions of sub-paragraphs (1) to (7) of paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988.
Paragraph (1) of regulation 2 specifies the class of hereditament to which these assumptions are to be applied. These are hereditaments whose rateable value is affected by virtue of a material change of circumstances caused by one or more of three things. Firstly, either or both of the respective Welsh Government response and the UK Government response to coronavirus. Secondly, any requirements of, or guidance or advice from, a public authority in the United Kingdom, the Welsh Government, the Scottish Government, the Northern Ireland Executive, the UK Government or a Government of a country or territory outside of the United Kingdom. Thirdly, any measures taken by a person to ensure compliance with health and safety legislation.
Paragraph (2) of regulation 2 prescribes the assumptions which are to be made when determining the rateable value of those hereditaments. The assumptions are that the matters which have caused a material change of circumstances had not occurred. A further assumption is that the rateable values must assume that the measures necessary to comply with health and safety legislation are the measures that were necessary to comply on 1 April 2015 with the legislation that then applied.
The Welsh Ministersâ€™ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained at the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the recommendations of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”), which reported in October 2019 on its review of the electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Bridgend. The Commission’s Report proposed a reduction in the number of electoral wards from 39 to 28, and a reduction in the number of councillors from 54 to 51.
This Order implements the Commission’s recommendations, with modifications.
Article 3 of this Order abolishes the existing electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Bridgend and introduces the Schedule, which sets out the new electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Bridgend.
This Order also implements recommendations for changes to the electoral arrangements for some communities within the County Borough of Bridgend.
Article 4 creates the new community wards of Brackla West, Brackla West Central, Brackla East Central and Brackla East within the community of Brackla. Article 5 sets out the number of members to be elected for these new wards.
Article 6 makes changes to the boundaries between the community wards of Nottage, Rest Bay, Newton, West Central and East Central within the community of Porthcawl. Article 7 makes changes to the number of members to be elected for the Nottage, Newton, West Central and East Central wards.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

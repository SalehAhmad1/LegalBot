(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (the “International Travel Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales to isolate for a period determined in accordance with those Regulations. The requirements imposed by the International Travel Regulations are subject to exceptions, and certain categories of person are exempt from having to comply. Regulation 2A of those Regulations contains exemptions to isolation and specific testing requirements in relation to certain categories of travellers who have been vaccinated against coronavirus or are under 18.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends regulation 2A of the International Travel Regulations to provide that the exemptions in regulation 2A do not extend to persons travelling from Metropolitan France.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations corrects a drafting error in the International Travel Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

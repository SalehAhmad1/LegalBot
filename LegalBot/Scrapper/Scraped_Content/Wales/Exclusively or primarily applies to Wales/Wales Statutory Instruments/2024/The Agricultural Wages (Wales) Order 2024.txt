20.  Any 2 periods of sickness absence which are separated by a period of not more than 14 days must be treated as a single period of sickness absence.Limitations on entitlement to agricultural sick pay
21.—(1) Agricultural sick pay will not be payable for the first 3 days sickness absence in circumstances where the duration of the sickness absence is less than 14 days.
(2) During each period of entitlement, the maximum number of weeks that an agricultural worker is entitled to agricultural sick pay is—

13 weeks in the second year of employment;
(b)

(c)
19 weeks in the fourth year of employment;

(e)
26 weeks in the sixth and all subsequent years of employment.
(3) Where an agricultural worker works basic hours or, where applicable any guaranteed overtime, on a fixed number of days each week, the maximum number of days of agricultural sick pay that the agricultural worker is entitled to is calculated by multiplying the maximum number of weeks relevant to the agricultural worker by the number of qualifying days worked each week.
(4) Where an agricultural worker works basic hours or, where applicable any guaranteed overtime, on a varying number of days each week, the maximum number of days of agricultural sick pay that the agricultural worker is entitled to is calculated by multiplying the maximum number of weeks relevant to that worker by the number of relevant days.
(5) The number of relevant days is calculated by dividing the number of qualifying days worked during a period of 12 months leading up to the period of sickness absence by 52.
(6) An agricultural worker’s maximum entitlement to agricultural sick pay applies regardless of the number of occasions of sickness absence during any period of entitlement.
(7) Subject to paragraph (8), in this article, “a period of entitlement” is a period beginning with the commencement of a sickness absence and ending 12 months later.
(8) If the agricultural worker has a period of sickness absence which commences at any time during the period of entitlement described in paragraph (7), but which continues beyond the end of that period of entitlement, the period of entitlement must be extended so as to end on whichever of the following first occurs—

(2) The amount of agricultural sick pay payable to an agricultural worker is determined by calculating the number of daily contractual hours that would have been worked during a period of sickness absence.
(3) The number of daily contractual hours are determined—
(a)
in circumstances where an agricultural worker works a fixed number of hours each week by dividing the total number of hours worked during any week by the number of days worked in that week;
(b)
in circumstances where an agricultural worker works a varying number of hours each week, by applying the formula—
where for the purposes of this article:
QH is the total number of qualifying hours in the period, and
DWEW is the number of days worked each week by the agricultural worker when taken as an average during a period of 8 weeks immediately preceding the commencement of the sickness absence.
(4) In this article “qualifying hours” are hours where—
(a)
the agricultural worker worked basic hours or guaranteed overtime,
(b)
the agricultural worker took annual leave or bereavement leave,
(c)
the agricultural worker had sickness absence qualifying for agricultural sick pay under this Order, or
(d)
the agricultural worker had sickness absence not qualifying for agricultural sick pay under this Order, and
“qualifying days” are any days within the period on which there were qualifying hours relating to the agricultural worker.
(5) For the purposes of calculations under this article, where an agricultural worker has been employed by their employer for less than 8 weeks, account must be taken of qualifying hours and qualifying days in the actual number of weeks of the agricultural worker’s employment with their employer.Agricultural sick pay to take account of statutory sick pay
23.  An amount equal to any payment of statutory sick pay made in accordance with Part XI of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992(1) in respect of a period of an agricultural worker’s sickness absence may be deducted from that worker’s agricultural sick pay.

(a)
the agricultural worker’s sickness absence ends,
(b)
the agricultural worker starts work for another employer, or
(c)
the maximum entitlement to agricultural sick pay in accordance with article 21 is exhausted.
(2) An agricultural worker whose contract has been terminated is not entitled to any agricultural sick pay after the end of their employment in accordance with paragraph (1) if the agricultural worker was given notice that their employer intended to terminate their contract or their apprenticeship before the period of sickness absence commenced.Overpayments of agricultural sick pay
26.—(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), if an agricultural worker who is entitled to agricultural sick pay under this Part is paid more agricultural sick pay than their entitlement, their employer can recover the overpayment of such agricultural sick pay by deduction from that agricultural worker’s wages.
(2) If an overpayment of agricultural sick pay under this Order is deducted as mentioned in paragraph (1), the employer must not deduct more than 20% of the agricultural worker’s gross wage unless notice has been given to terminate the employment or the employment has already been terminated in which case more than 20% of the agricultural worker’s gross wage may be deducted by the employer from payment of the agricultural worker’s final wages.Damages recovered for loss of earnings
27.—(1) This article applies to an agricultural worker whose entitlement to agricultural sick pay arises because of the actions or omissions of a person other than their employer and damages are recovered by the agricultural worker in respect of loss of earnings suffered during the period in respect of which the agricultural worker received agricultural sick pay from their employer.
(2) Where paragraph (1) applies—
(a)
the agricultural worker must immediately notify their employer of all the relevant circumstances and of any claim and of any damages recovered under any compromise, settlement or judgment,

33.—(1) Where an agricultural worker works their basic hours on a varying number of days each week, the number of days worked each week for the purposes of the Table in Schedule 2, is to be taken as an average of the number of qualifying days worked each week during the period of 52 weeks immediately preceding the commencement of the agricultural worker’s annual leave and that average number of qualifying days must, where appropriate, be rounded to the nearest whole day.
(2) At the end of the annual leave year the employer must calculate the agricultural worker’s actual entitlement for the purposes of the Table in Schedule 2, based upon the number of qualifying days worked each week, taken as an average of the number of qualifying days worked each week during the annual leave year (i.e. over a period of 52 weeks) and the average number of qualifying days must be, where appropriate, rounded to the nearest whole day.
(3) If at the end of the annual leave year, the agricultural worker has accrued but untaken holiday entitlement, the agricultural worker is entitled to carry forward any accrued but untaken holiday to the following annual leave year in accordance with article 35(3) of this Order or the agricultural worker and the employer may agree to a payment in lieu of any accrued but untaken holiday in accordance with article 38 of this Order.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order revokes and replaces, subject to some changes and a transitional provision, the Agricultural Wages (Wales) Order 2023.
Part 2 of the Order provides that agricultural workers are to be employed subject to the terms and conditions set out in Parts 2 to 5 of the Order (article 3) and specifies the different grades and categories of agricultural worker (article 5 to 9).
Part 3 makes provision about the minimum rates of remuneration that must be paid to agricultural workers (article 11). Provision is made for accommodation offset allowance which may be deducted from an agricultural worker’s remuneration (article 15). Provision is also made for dog allowance, on-call allowance, night work allowance and birth and adoption grants which do not form part of an agricultural worker’s remuneration (article 16).
Part 4 provides that an agricultural worker is entitled to agricultural sick pay in the circumstances specified (articles 18 to 21). Provision is made about calculating the amount of agricultural sick pay that an agricultural worker is entitled to (article 22). A payment of statutory sick pay is to count towards an agricultural worker’s entitlement to agricultural sick pay (article 23).
Part 5 makes provision about an agricultural worker’s entitlement to time off. Provision is made about an agricultural worker’s entitlement to rest breaks (article 28), daily rest (article 29) and weekly rest period (article 30). Provision is also made specifying the agricultural worker’s annual leave year and about the agricultural worker’s entitlement to annual leave, holiday pay and about payment in lieu of annual leave (articles 31 to 38). Provision about an agricultural worker’s entitlement to be paid bereavement leave is made in articles 41 to 43.
Part 6 contains a revocation and a transitional provision.

Residues of dithiocarbamates (dithiocarbamates expressed as CS2, including maneb, mancozeb, metiram, propineb, thiram and ziram) and metrafenone.
(6)
The analytical report referred to in Article 10(3) of this Regulation must be issued by a laboratory accredited for the analysis of PCP in food and feed in accordance with BS EN ISO/IEC 17025:2017 “General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories” (published by the British Standards Institution on 30 June 2018 (ISBN 978 0 539 01414 3), and available from the British Standards Institution at https://knowledge.bsigroup.com). The analytical report must indicate: (a) the results of sampling and analysis for the presence of PCP, performed by the competent authorities of the country of origin or of the country where the consignment is consigned from if that country is different from the country of origin; (b) the measurement uncertainty of the analytical result; (c) the limit of detection (LOD) of the analytical method; (d) the limit of quantification (LOQ) of the analytical method. The extraction before analysis must be performed with an acidified solvent. The analysis must be carried out according to the modified version of the QuEChERS method or according to an equally reliable method. The modified version of the QuEChERS method is set out in the document “Analytical Quality Control and Method Validation Procedures for Pesticide Residues Analysis in Food and Feed” (SANTE 2017/11813), implemented on 1 January 2020 and available at https://www.eurl-pesticides.eu/userfiles/file/EurlALL/AqcGuidance_SANTE_2019_12682.pdf.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend, in relation to Wales, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1793 on the temporary increase of official controls and emergency measures governing the entry into the Union of certain goods from certain third countries (EUR 2019/1793).
Regulation 2 makes provision to update the lists of high-risk food and feed of non-animal origin in Annexes 1 and 2 to EUR 2019/1793. Regulation 2(4) and (5), and Schedules 1 and 2, substitute those Annexes. The substitution of Annex 1 is made using powers in Articles 47(2)(b) and 54(4)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (EUR 2017/625). The substitution of Annex 2 is made using powers in Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (EUR 2002/178) and Article 54(4)(b) of EUR 2017/625.
Regulation 2(2), (3) and (6), and Schedule 3, amend EUR 2019/1793 to make provision in relation to sampling and analysis for the hazard Listeria. The prescribed sampling procedure and analytical reference method for the control of presence of Listeria in food is set out in the new Annex 3a to EUR 2019/1793 (inserted by regulation 2(6) and Schedule 3).
Regulation 3 makes consequential amendments to the Official Controls (Import of High-Risk Food and Feed of Non-Animal Origin) (Amendment of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1793) (Wales) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1330 (W. 269), to remove earlier amendments to EUR 2019/1793 that are superseded by the amendments made by these Regulations.
Annex 1 to EUR 2019/1793 contains the list of food and feed of non-animal origin that is subject to a temporary increase in official controls at border control posts or at control points in Great Britain. The changes being made to Annex 1 are as follows.
A new entry for groundnuts paste from Bolivia (for aflatoxins). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 50%.
The entries for groundnuts (peanuts) and associated products, from Brazil, (for aflatoxins) have been removed.
A correction to the table footnote reference in the entry for groundnuts (peanuts) and associated products, from Brazil (for pesticides residues).
A new entry for groundnuts paste from Brazil (for pesticide residues). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 20%.
A new entry for groundnuts paste from China (for aflatoxins). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 10%.
The frequency of checks on sweet peppers (Capsicum annum) from China (for Salmonella) is decreased to 10% (from 20%).
A new entry for granadilla (Passiflora ligularis) and passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) from Colombia (for pesticide residues). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 10%.
A correction to the entry for yardlong beans from the Dominican Republic (for pesticides residues).
A new entry for bananas from Ecuador (for pesticide residues). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 5%.
A new entry for oranges from Egypt (for pesticide residues). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 10%.
The frequency of checks on palm oil from Ghana (for Sudan dyes) is decreased to 20% (from 50%).
A new entry for cinnamon and cinnamon-tree flowers from India (for pesticide residues). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 10%.
A new entry for cloves (whole fruit, cloves and stems) from India (for pesticide residues). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 10%.
A new entry for drumsticks (Moringa oleifera) from India (for pesticide residues). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 20%.
A new entry for ginger, saffron, turmeric (Curcuma), thyme, bay leaves, curry and other spices, from India (for pesticide residues). The frequency of checks is prescribed at 10%.

These Regulations amend the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) (Prescription of Drugs Etc.) (Wales) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/1022 (W. 119)) (“the principal Regulations”), which make provision as to the drugs, medicines or other substances that may be ordered for patients in the provision of medical services under a general medical services contract (“GMS contract”) within the meaning of section 42 of the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 (c. 42).
Regulation 2 makes amendments to the table in Schedule 2 to the principal Regulations (drugs or medicines to be ordered only in certain circumstances) which restricts the circumstances in which drugs and medicines specified in column 1 of the table may be ordered for the category of patients described in column 2 of the table for the purpose specified in column 3 of the table.
Regulation 2(2)(a) to (c) restricts the circumstances in which drugs and medicines that consist of or contain gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues may be ordered.

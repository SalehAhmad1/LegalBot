7 March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Care and Support (Charging) (Wales) Regulations 2015 (“the Charging Regulations”).
The Charging Regulations set out the requirements which local authorities must follow when making a determination of the amount of the charges which apply in relation to care and support which they are providing or arranging in the course of carrying out their functions under Part 4 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. The Charging Regulations also contain parallel provisions setting out requirements which apply when a local authority makes direct payments to meet a person’s need for care and support.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends regulation 13 of the Charging Regulations (minimum income amount where a person is provided with accommodation in a care home) to increase the net weekly income amount from £39.50 to £43.90. Regulation 28 is also amended to make corresponding change for a recipient of direct payments.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

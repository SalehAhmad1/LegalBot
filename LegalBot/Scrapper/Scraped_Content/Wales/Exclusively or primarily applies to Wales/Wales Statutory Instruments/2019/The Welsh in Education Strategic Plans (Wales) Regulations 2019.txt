(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 84 of the School Standards and Organisation (Wales) Act 2013 (“the 2013 Act”) requires a local authority to prepare a Welsh in education strategic plan (“plan”). Section 85 of the 2013 Act requires a local authority to submit its plan to the Welsh Ministers for approval prior to that plan being published.
These Regulations are made under sections 84, 87 and 97 of the 2013 Act. They make provision for a local authority to prepare a ten year plan, the first to have effect from 1 September 2021, subject to the Welsh Ministers' approval. They also make provision for the following matters:
(a)
the form and content of the plan (regulation 3);
(b)
the duration of the plan (regulation 4);
(c)
the date by which the plan must be submitted to the Welsh Ministers for approval (regulation 5);
(d)
the approval of a plan (regulation 6);
(e)
timescales for submitting a review report (regulation 7);
(f)
arrangements for revising a plan (regulation 8);
(g)
the persons and bodies that a local authority must consult on the draft plan (regulation 9);
(h)
the date by which the plan must be published (regulation 10);
(i)
the manner of publication of a plan (regulation 11);
(j)
the revocation, with savings, of the Welsh in Education Strategic Plans and Assessing Demand for Welsh Medium Education (Wales) Regulations 2013 (regulation 12).
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Pupil Wellbeing Branch, the Support for Learners Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

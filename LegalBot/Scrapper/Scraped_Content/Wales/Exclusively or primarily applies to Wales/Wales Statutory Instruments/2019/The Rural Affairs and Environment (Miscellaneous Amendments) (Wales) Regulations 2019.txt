28 October 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to legislation relating to environmental protection and food.
Regulation 2 amends the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (Wales) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/995 (W. 81)) (“the 2009 Regulations”). The amendments relate to the implementation of Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1010 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the alignment of reporting obligations in the field of legislation related to the environment (OJ No. L 170, 25.6.2019, p. 115). Regulation (EU) 2019/1010 amends Article 18 of, and replaces Annex 6 to, Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage (OJ No. L 143, 30.4.2004, p. 56). Regulation 2 inserts a new provision into the 2009 Regulations which requires enforcing authorities to report certain information relating to cases of environmental damage to the Welsh Ministers.
Regulation 3 amends the Eggs and Chicks (Wales) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1671 (W. 158)) (“the 2010 Regulations”), which make provision for the enforcement and execution of marketing standards applicable to eggs for hatching, farmyard poultry chicks, and eggs in shell for human consumption. Regulation 3(2) to (5) adjusts references to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in the enforcement provisions within the 2010 Regulations.
Regulation 4 amends the Poultrymeat (Wales) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1719 (W. 195)) (“the 2011 Regulations”), which make provision for the enforcement and execution of marketing standards applicable to poultrymeat. Regulation 4(2) adjusts references to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in the enforcement provisions within the 2011 Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2 of these Regulations is made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. Regulation 2 amends the Marketing of Fruit Plant and Propagating Material (Wales) Regulations 2017 to enable the Welsh Ministers to authorise the marketing of fruit plant and propagating material from countries outside the European Union in certain circumstances.
Part 3 of these Regulations is made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. Regulation 3 amends the Marketing of Seeds and Plant Propagating Material (Amendment) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 to ensure that the amendment made by regulation 2 continues to operate effectively after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

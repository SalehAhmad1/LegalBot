The Welsh Ministers, as traffic authority for the A470 
Trunk Road, are satisfied that traffic on a specified 
length of the trunk road should be prohibited because 
of the likelihood of danger to the public on or near the 
road. 
The Welsh Ministers, therefore, in exercise of the 
powers conferred upon them by section 14(1) and (4) 
of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984(1), make this 
Order.

(Llanrwst, Conwy County Borough) (Temporary One 
Way Traffic) Order 2019 and it comes into force on 3

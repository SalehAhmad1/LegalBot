10 December 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Whelk Fishing (Wales) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/1042 (W. 184)) (“the Principal Order”).
Article 5 of the Principal Order currently prohibits the carriage of whelk with a size of less than the specified minimum size by British fishing boats within the Welsh zone. The “specified minimum size” for whelk is defined in article 2 of the Principal Order.
Article 2(2) of this Order replaces “purpose” with “purposes” in the English language text of article 4 of the Principal Order.
Article 2(3) substitutes a new article 5 in the Principal Order. The effect of this substitution is that a British fishing boat may carry whelks with a size of less than the specified minimum size within the Welsh zone if it has not fished in the Welsh zone during that particular fishing trip.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 2) (“the 2016 Act”) relating to the regulation of social workers and social care managers in Wales and make savings and transitional provision in connection with those amendments.
Regulation 14 amends the reference to “European lawyer” in paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 to the 2016 Act in line with the transitional arrangements made for lawyers from EEA states and Switzerland by the Services of Lawyers and Lawyer's Practice (Revocation etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

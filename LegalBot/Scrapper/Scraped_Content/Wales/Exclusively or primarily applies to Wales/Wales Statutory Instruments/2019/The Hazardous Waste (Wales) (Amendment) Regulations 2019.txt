Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1(2)
The Welsh Ministers make these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of, and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(1) (“the ECA 1972”).
The Welsh Ministers are designated(2) for the purposes of section 2(2) of the ECA 1972 in relation to measures relating to the prevention, reduction and elimination of pollution caused by waste(3) and the prevention, reduction and management of waste(4).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the ECA 1972, and it appears to the Welsh Ministers that it is expedient for references to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants (recast)(5) to be construed as references to that Regulation as amended from time to time.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Hazardous Waste (Wales) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/1806 (W. 138)) (“the 2005 Regulations”) in order to supplement Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants (recast) (OJ No. L 169, 25.6.2019, p. 45).
Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 replaces and repeals Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants (OJ No. L 158, 30.4.2004, p. 7).

The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

7 February 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend a number of statutory instruments in relation to food composition. These Regulations apply in relation to Wales.
Regulations 2, 4, 6 and 8 remove certain exemptions for products from EU member States or EEA countries (subject to transitional provisions). The exemptions are no longer appropriate following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 also amends the Bread and Flour Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/141), in relation to Wales, to provide new exemptions for bread or flour that is to be exported to third countries, or is to be used only for production of food that is to be exported to third counties.
Regulations 3, 5, 7 and 9 introduce a transitional period, beginning with the day these Regulations come into force and ending at the end of 30 September 2022, during which the removed exemptions continue to apply.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

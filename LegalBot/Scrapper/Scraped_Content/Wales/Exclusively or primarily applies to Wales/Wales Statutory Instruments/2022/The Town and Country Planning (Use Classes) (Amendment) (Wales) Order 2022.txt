26 September 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (S.I. 1987/764) (“the Use Classes Order”).
The Use Classes Order specifies classes of use of buildings or other land for the purposes of section 55(2)(f) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Section 55(2)(f) provides that a change of use is not development where the former use and the new use are both within the same class. Changes of use which are not to be taken to involve development do not require planning permission.
Article 3(6) of the Use Classes Order lists uses which are excluded from the classes of use set out in the Schedule to that Order. Article 2(2) amends Article 3(6) of the Use Classes Order to include betting offices in that list. Article 2(3) removes betting offices from use class A2.
Article 2(4)(c) limits use class C3 to use of a dwellinghouse as a sole or main residence and occupied for more than 183 days in a calendar year.
Article 2(4)(e) introduces a new use class C5 which covers use of a dwellinghouse other than as a sole or main residence and occupied for 183 days or fewer in a calendar year.
Article 2(4)(f) introduces a new use class C6 which covers use of a dwellinghouse for commercial short-term letting not longer than 31 days for each period of occupation.

These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989 (S.I. 1989/306) (“the principal Regulations”), which provide for the making and recovery of charges for relevant services provided under the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 (c. 42) to overseas visitors.
Regulation 2 amends the principal Regulations to provide exemptions from charging in relation to overseas visitors who are lawfully present in the United Kingdom but are ordinarily resident in Ukraine, as well as exemptions for their family members, authorised companions (the definition for which is amended by regulation 2(2) to include persons accompanying overseas visitors from Ukraine who are receiving a course of treatment) and authorised children.
Regulation 2 also provides that charges incurred since 24 February 2022 until the coming into force of these Regulations in respect of such overseas visitors—
if not yet made, must not be made,
if made, must not be recovered, or
if paid, must be repaid.
Regulation 3 provides for the Welsh Ministers to carry out a review before 1 October 2022.

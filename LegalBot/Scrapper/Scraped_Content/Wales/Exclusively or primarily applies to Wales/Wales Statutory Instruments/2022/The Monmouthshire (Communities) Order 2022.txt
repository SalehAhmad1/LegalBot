11 March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”) reported in January 2019 on a review of community arrangements in the County of Monmouthshire conducted by Monmouthshire County Council. The Commission’s Report recommended changes to the existing boundaries of communities within the area of Monmouthshire County Council and consequential changes to electoral arrangements.
The Commission’s proposals have been largely implemented by the Welsh Ministers in the Monmouthshire (Communities) Order 2021 (“the 2021 Order”).
Article 3 of this Order takes precedence over article 42 of the 2021 Order (insofar as that article relates to the transfer of area from the Green Lane ward of the community of Caldicot to The Village ward of the community of Caldicot), in order to give full effect to the Commission’s proposals.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.
Prints of the map to which this Order relates are deposited in the office of the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ (Local Government Democracy Division), and with Monmouthshire County Council. Prints deposited with Monmouthshire County Council are open to inspection by anyone affected by the provisions of this Order.

21 November 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments consequential on those amendments made by Part 4 of Schedule 7 to the Agriculture Act 2020 (c. 21).
The amendments relate to marketing standards and are made to both retained direct EU legislation and EU derived domestic legislation. The amendments either omit cross references to articles of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 (EUR 2013/1308) (“the CMO Regulation”) which have been disapplied by Part 4 of Schedule 7 to the Agriculture Act 2020, in some cases together with associated wording, or operate to substitute references to articles of the CMO Regulation with an appropriate reference to retained EU legislation or to the Agriculture Act 2020.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

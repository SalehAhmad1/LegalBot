8 December 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Water Resources (Control of Agricultural Pollution) (Wales) Regulations 2021 (“the 2021 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 2 of the 2021 Regulations to change the implementation date for regulations 4 and 36 of the 2021 Regulations from 1 January 2023 to 30 April 2023 for holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within a nitrate vulnerable zone (“NVZ”).
Regulation 2(3) inserts a definition of “NVZ index map”.
Regulation 2(4) amends regulation 4 of the 2021 Regulations so the 170kg per hectare maximum limit of nitrogen in livestock manure applies to each 12 month period beginning with 30 April for holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within an NVZ.
Regulation 2(5) amends regulation 36 of the 2021 Regulations so the relevant record keeping period reflects the 12 month period beginning 30 April under regulation 4 for holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within an NVZ. It also makes clear the first relevant record keeping period for occupier of holdings or parts of holdings not previously situated within an NVZ is 30 April 2023 to 29 April 2024.
Regulation 2(6) and (7) correct errors in Schedules 1 and 3 respectively to the 2021 Regulations.

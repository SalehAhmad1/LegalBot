Minister for Climate Change, one of the Welsh MinistersEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under section 255 of the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 1) (“the 2016 Act”).
The 2016 Act provides for most tenancies and licences of dwellings occupied by individuals as homes in Wales to be occupation contracts. Two types of occupation contract can exist under the 2016 Act: secure contracts (which are periodic contracts) or standard contracts (which are either fixed term or periodic contracts) (see sections 8 to 17 of the 2016 Act). Not all tenancies and licences of dwellings will be occupation contracts (see Schedule 2 to the 2016 Act). The 2016 Act also makes provision as to the terms of occupation contracts.
These Regulations make consequential amendments to primary legislation to reflect the new provisions in the 2016 Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this instrument.

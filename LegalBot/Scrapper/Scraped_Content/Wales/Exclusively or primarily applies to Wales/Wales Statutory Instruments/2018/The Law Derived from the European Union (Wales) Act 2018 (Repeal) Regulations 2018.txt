The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. A regulatory impact assessment was undertaken in relation to the Act. That regulatory impact assessment included an assessment of the option to continue to work with the UK Government to amend the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, the better to reflect the devolution settlement. As these Regulations reflect that option, information on the impact of these Regulations can be found in that regulatory impact assessment.

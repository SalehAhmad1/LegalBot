maintenance grant payable to the student under regulation 46, and
(b)

(a)
Column 1 specifies the academic year in relation to which the amounts of living support in Column 3 apply;
(b)
Column 2 specifies the location in which the student is living (see paragraph 3 of Schedule 1);

(b)
the amounts of grant identified at Step 1 plus the minimum amount of maintenance loan payable to the student as specified by reference to Table 8A,

3 July 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (“the 2018 Regulations”) provide for financial support for students taking designated higher education courses which begin on or after 1 August 2018. The 2018 Regulations also provide support for courses which begin before 1 August 2018 and are subsequently converted from full-time to part-time or part-time to full-time on or after 1 August 2018.
These Regulations amend the 2018 Regulations.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 46(3)(c) of the 2018 Regulations so that where a student’s household income exceeds £18,370 but is less than £59,200, the maximum amount of maintenance grant payable is reduced by £1 for every £5.750 of household income exceeding £18,370 where the student is living away from home, studying somewhere other than London.
Regulation 4 substitutes new regulation 56 for regulation 56 of the 2018 Regulations. The new regulation makes provision for the calculation of the amount of maintenance loan payable to full-time students who qualify for a special support payment under regulation 50 of the 2018 Regulations.
Regulation 5 inserts a new paragraph into regulation 58 of the 2018 Regulations as a consequence of regulation 6. Regulation 6 provides for a new regulation to be inserted into the 2018 Regulations as regulation 58A. Regulation 58A makes provision for the calculation of maintenance loan payable to part-time students who qualify for a special support payment under regulation 50 of the 2018 Regulations.
Regulations 7, 8, 9 and 10 amend, respectively, regulations 81, 93, 94 and 95 of the 2018 Regulations which deal with the calculation of maintenance loan entitlement where a student qualifies for support but at a point during the academic year is absent from the course or their period of eligibility ends or is terminated.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

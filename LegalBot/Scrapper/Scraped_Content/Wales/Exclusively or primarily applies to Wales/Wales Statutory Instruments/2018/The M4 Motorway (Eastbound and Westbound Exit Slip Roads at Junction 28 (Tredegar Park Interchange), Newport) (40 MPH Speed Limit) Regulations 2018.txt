(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Welsh Ministers make these Regulations which impose a maximum speed limit of 40 miles per hour (instead of the general 70 miles per hour speed limit imposed on motorways by the Motorways Traffic (Speed Limit) Regulations 1974 (S.I. 1974/502)) on the lengths of the M4 motorway slip roads specified in the Schedule to these Regulations.
These Regulations also amend the M4 Motorway (West of Junction 23A (Magor) to East of Junction 29 (Castleton)) (Variable Speed Limits) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1018 (W. 72)). The effect of the amendment is to remove a small length of the westbound off slip road at junction 28 (Tredegar Park) of the M4 from the section of road which is subject to a variable speed limit. A maximum speed of 40 miles per hour applies to that length of slip road under these Regulations.

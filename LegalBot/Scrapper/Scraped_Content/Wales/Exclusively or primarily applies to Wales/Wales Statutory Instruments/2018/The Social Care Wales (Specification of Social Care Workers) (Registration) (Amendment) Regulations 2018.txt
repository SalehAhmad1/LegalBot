These Regulations specify an additional description of social care workers in respect of which Social Care Wales must keep a register, namely those who are employed or engaged by a regulated domiciliary support service to provide care and support to persons referred to in paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 to the Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations.

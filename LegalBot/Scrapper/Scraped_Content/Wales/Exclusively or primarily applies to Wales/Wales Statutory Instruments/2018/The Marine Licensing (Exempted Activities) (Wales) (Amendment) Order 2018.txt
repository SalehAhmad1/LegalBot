Article 3 revokes the Marine Licensing (Exempted Activities) (Wales) (Amendment) Order 2016.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of regulatory impact assessments for subordinate legislation was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

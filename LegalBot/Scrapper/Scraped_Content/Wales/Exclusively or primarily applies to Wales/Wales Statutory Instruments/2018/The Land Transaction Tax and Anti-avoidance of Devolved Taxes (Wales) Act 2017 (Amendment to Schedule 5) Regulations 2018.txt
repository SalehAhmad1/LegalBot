31 January 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Schedule 5 to the Land Transaction Tax and Anti-avoidance of Devolved Taxes (Wales) Act 2017 (“the Act”) to extend the scope of the exceptions from the rates applicable to a higher rates residential property transaction provided by paragraphs 7 and 16.
Paragraph 7 provides that a transaction is not a higher rates residential property transaction where the major interest acquired by the buyer is an additional interest in their only or main residence. Such a transaction may arise where there is a transfer of equity from a co-owner in the dwelling. Paragraph 16 of Schedule 5 to the Act makes equivalent provision where the buyer acquires a number of dwellings as part of a single transaction.
Regulation 2 amends paragraphs 7 and 16 to extend the scope of the exceptions. The amendments ensure that a buyer is able to rely on the exceptions provided by paragraphs 7 and 16 in cases where that buyer is acquiring a major interest in a dwelling and—
(a)
immediately before the effective date of the transaction, the buyer’s spouse or civil partner owns a major interest in the same dwelling; and
(b)
that dwelling will be the buyer’s only or main residence immediately before and after the effective date of the transaction.

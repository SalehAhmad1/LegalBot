(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These regulations make consequential amendments arising from the Regulation of Registered Social Landlords (Wales) Act 2018 (“the Act”).
Regulations 2 and 3 amend primary legislation to update cross-references to “exempt disposals” as a result of changes made by the Act and as a result of the repeal of the requirements to obtain Welsh Ministers’ consent to certain activities carried out by registered social landlords by the Act.
Regulation 4 amends the Land Registration Rules 2003 SI (S.I. 2003/1417) as a result of the repeal of requirements to obtain Welsh Ministers’ consent to certain activities carried out by registered social landlords by the Act.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

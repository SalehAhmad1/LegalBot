The Welsh Ministers, in exercise of the powers conferred on the Secretary of State by sections 1, 3, 34 and 35 of, and paragraphs 1, 2, 7, 8 and 10 of Schedule 1 to, the Building Act 1984(1), now exercisable by them(2), having consulted the Building Regulations Advisory Committee for Wales and such other bodies as appear to them to be representative of the interests concerned in accordance with section 14(7) of the Building Act 1984(3), make the following Regulations:
(1)
1984 c. 55. Section 1 was amended by section 1 of the Sustainable and Secure Buildings Act 2004 (c. 22) (“the 2004 Act”). Paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 was amended by section 3 of the 2004 Act and by section 11 of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 (c. 19); and paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 was amended by section 3 of the 2004 Act and section 40 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (c. 29).

The functions conferred on the Secretary of State by sections 1, 3 and 34 and paragraphs 1, 2, 7, 8 and 10 of Schedule 1 to the Building Act 1984 (“the 1984 Act”) were, insofar as exercisable in relation to Wales, transferred to the Welsh Ministers by the Welsh Ministers (Transfer of Functions) (No. 2) Order 2009 (S.I. 2009/3019) (“the 2009 Order”) subject to articles 3 and 4 of that Order.

30 April 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Building Regulations 2010 (“the 2010 Regulations”).
Regulation 3(1) amends regulation 36 (water efficiency of new dwellings) to introduce a new requirement that where a dwelling is erected the potential consumption of wholesome water by persons occupying the dwelling must not exceed 110 litres per person per day. The current requirement of 125 litres remains where there is a material change of use such that a building is used as a dwelling or contains a flat, in either case where previously it did not.
Regulation 3(3) adds paragraph G2A (water efficiency of new buildings other than dwellings and healthcare buildings) to Part G (sanitation, hot water safety and water efficiency) of Schedule 1 (requirements relating to building work). The new requirement does not apply to dwellings or healthcare buildings.
Regulation 4 has the effect of designating regulations 23 (requirements for the renovation or replacement of thermal elements), 25B (nearly zero-energy requirements for new buildings) and 26 (CO2 emission rates for new buildings) for the purposes of section 35 of the Building Act 1984 (penalty for contravening building regulations) in so far as those regulations apply to Crown buildings or to building work carried out or proposed to be carried out by Crown authorities.
Regulation 5 adds Part Q (security) to Schedule 1. This new requirement only applies to the erection of dwellings.
Regulation 6 contains transitional provision.
Some minor and consequential drafting changes have also been made.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained at www.wales.gov.

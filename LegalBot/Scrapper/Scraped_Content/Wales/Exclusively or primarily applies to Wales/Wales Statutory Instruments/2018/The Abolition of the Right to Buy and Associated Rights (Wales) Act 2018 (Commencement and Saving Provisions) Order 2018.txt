29 January 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into force provisions of the Abolition of the Right to Buy and Associated Rights (Wales) Act 2018 (“the Act”).
Article 2 appoints 26 January 2019 for the coming into force of sections 6 and 7 of the Act which abolish the right to buy and the right to acquire, and remove the power to make grants in respect of discounts on disposals otherwise than in pursuance of the right to acquire.
Article 3 makes saving provision to ensure that any claims to exercise the right to buy or the right to acquire which are served on the landlord before the 26 January 2019 will continue to be progressed under legislation that otherwise no longer applies in relation to dwellings in Wales. This saving provision also ensures that the legislation in force on 25 January 2019 will continue to apply to sales made under the right to buy and the right to acquire. This means that existing duties, for example, to repay discount upon resale within 5 years, will continue to apply.
Article 4 makes saving provision to preserve the effect of section 21 of the Housing Act 1996 in relation to any disposals made before 26 January 2019.

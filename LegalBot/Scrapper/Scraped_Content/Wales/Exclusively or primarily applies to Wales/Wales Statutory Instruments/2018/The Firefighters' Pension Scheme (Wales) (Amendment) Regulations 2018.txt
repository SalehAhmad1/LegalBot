9 May 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (Wales) Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”) which established a scheme for the payment of pensions and other benefits to firefighters in Wales from 1 April 2015.
Regulations 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8(2) make minor amendments to clarify the provisions of the 2015 Regulations.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 80A of the 2015 Regulations to clarify how the lump sum should be calculated where a member is entitled to the immediate payment of an equivalent amount to the lower tier ill health pension in the Firefighters’ Pension (Wales) Scheme 1992 (set out in Schedule 2 to the Firemen’s Pension Scheme Order 1992) and exercises the option to commute part of the pension for a lump sum.
Regulation 8(3) amends paragraphs 37 and 38 of Schedule 2 to the 2015 Regulations to provide for the transitional arrangements in the event that the authority decides to obtain the written opinion of an independent qualified medical practitioner (a medical practitioner as defined in the 2015 Regulations) before making a determination about a member’s entitlement to an ill-health award and the determination has not been made before the member’s transition date. The amendments provide that members who are subsequently granted an ill health award remain in their existing pension scheme.
Regulation 9 corrects a minor error in the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (Wales) (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Regulations 2015.
The amendments made by the Regulations have effect from 1 April 2015, except for those made by regulation 8(3) which have effect from 1 June 2018.
The Welsh Ministers’ Regulatory Impact Assessment Code for Subordinate Legislation has been considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

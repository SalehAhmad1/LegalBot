(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Care Wales Planning, Placement and Case Review (Wales) Regulations 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”).
Part 3 of the 2015 Regulations contains general provisions about the placement of a looked after child, with regulation 12 making specific provision in relation to out of area placements.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations adds to the information which must be notified by the responsible authority to the out of area local authority or the local authority in England in whose area the child has been placed under regulation 12(8) of the 2015 Regulations, and which must be supplied not later than 24 hours after the placement is made.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

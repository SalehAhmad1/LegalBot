(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply to Wales, specify fees payable to the Welsh Ministers in relation to plant health services and the certification of seed potatoes, fruit plants and fruit plant propagating material. They revoke and replace the Plant Health Fees (Wales) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1792 (W. 185)).
The fees specified in regulations 3, 6 and 7 are payable in relation to imports of plants, plant products and other objects from third countries pursuant to the requirements of Article 13 of Council Directive 2000/29/EC on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (OJ No L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1).
The fees specified in regulations 4 and 5 are payable in relation to other inspections and activities carried out pursuant to Council Directive 2000/29/EC.
The fees specified in regulation 8 are payable in relation to certain inspections and other activities carried out pursuant to Council Directive 2002/56/EC on the marketing of seed potatoes (OJ No L 193, 20.7.2002, p. 60).
The fees specified in regulation 9 are payable in relation to certain inspections and other activities carried out pursuant to Council Directive 2008/90/EC on the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production (OJ No L 267, 8.10.2008, p. 8).
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Order)
By virtue of sections 41(2) and 52(2) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”), read in conjunction with the Rating Lists (Postponement of Compilation) (Wales) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/1370 (W. 139)) made under section 54A of the 1988 Act, non-domestic rating lists for Wales are to be compiled on 1 April 2017 and every fifth year afterwards.
Paragraph 2(3)(b) of Schedule 6 to the 1988 Act provides that for the purposes of compiling such lists, the rateable value of a non-domestic hereditament is to be determined by reference to the day on which the lists must be compiled or on such day preceding that day as may be specified by order.
Article 2 of this Order specifies 1 April 2019 as that day for the purposes of the next local and central non-domestic rating lists to be compiled once this Order has come into force.
Article 3 revokes the Rating Lists (Valuation Date) (Wales) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/2917 (W. 297)), which specified the day by reference to which properties were to be valued for the purposes of the lists compiled on 1 April 2017.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order. A copy can be obtained from the Local Taxation Policy Branch, the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

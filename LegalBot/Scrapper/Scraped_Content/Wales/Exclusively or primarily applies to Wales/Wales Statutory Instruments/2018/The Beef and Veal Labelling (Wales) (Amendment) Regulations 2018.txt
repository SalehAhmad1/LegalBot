15 November 2018EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Beef and Veal Labelling (Wales) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/991 (W. 145)) to reflect provisions in Regulation (EU) No 653/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 as regards electronic identification of bovine animals and labelling of beef (OJ No L 189, 27.6.2014, p. 33).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations as the amendments are technical in nature.

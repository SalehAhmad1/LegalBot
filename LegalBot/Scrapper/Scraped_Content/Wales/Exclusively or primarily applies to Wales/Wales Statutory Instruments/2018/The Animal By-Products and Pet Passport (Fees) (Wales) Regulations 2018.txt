(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in relation to Wales, set out fees payable to the Welsh Ministers in the field of animal health.
Regulation 4 provides that fees are payable by operators of establishments and plants that are required to be approved and inspected under Regulation (EC) No. 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption (OJ No. L 300, 14.11.2009, p. 1). These fees are set out in the Schedule.
The fees are set at 50% of the full cost recovery of costs incurred by the Welsh Ministers in the period up to and including 30 June 2019 (with the exception of travel time to premises which represents full cost recovery from the outset), and then set at 100% of the full cost recovery thereafter.
The fees in regulation 5 are payable in respect of the delivery of pet animal passports to authorised veterinarians for the purpose of the issuing of a pet passport to enable a dog, cat or ferret to travel abroad with its owner.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

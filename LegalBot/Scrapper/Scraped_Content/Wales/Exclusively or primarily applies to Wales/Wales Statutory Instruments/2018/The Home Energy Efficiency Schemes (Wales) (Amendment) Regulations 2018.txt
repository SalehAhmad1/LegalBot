(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Home Energy Efficiency Schemes (Wales) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/656 (W. 94)) (“the principal Regulations”).

Regulation 4 updates the eligibility criteria under the principal Regulations. It removes provision for partial grant applications, updates the minimum asset rating a dwelling must have to be eligible for a works application and provides that a dwelling which has previously had works carried out in relation to a works application will not be eligible to make further applications.
Regulation 5 provides for the provision of low energy light bulbs under the principal Regulations.
Regulation 6 updates the methodology by which the Welsh Ministers may determine maximum levels of grants under the principal Regulations.
Regulation 7 provides for transitional provision in respect of ongoing applications approved prior to the coming into force of these Regulations.

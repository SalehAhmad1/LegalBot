(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Non-Domestic Rating (Demand Notices) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”) (S.I. 2017/113 (W. 39)) provide for the contents of non-domestic rates demand notices which are served by or on behalf of billing authorities in Wales. Schedule 2 to the 2017 Regulations sets out the information which must be included in the explanatory notes that must accompany a demand notice, which includes information as to the small business rates relief scheme that is applicable in Wales.
The Non-Domestic Rating (Small Business Relief) (Wales) Order 2017 (“the 2017 Small Business Relief Order”) (S.I. 2017/1229 (W. 293)) introduces a new small business rates relief scheme in Wales from 1 April 2018. These Regulations amend Schedule 2 to the 2017 Regulations so that the information provided in the explanatory notes that accompany demand notices issued in relation to financial years beginning on or after 1 April 2018, refers to the 2017 Small Business Relief Order.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

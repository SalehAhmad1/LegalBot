EDUCATION, WALES 
The Diocese of St Davids

Church in Wales School) (Wales) 
Order 2018 
Made 
  
 
18 July 2018 
Coming into force 
 31 July 2018 
 
The Endowment has been shown to the satisfaction of 
the Welsh Ministers to be or to have been held in 
connection with the provision of religious education in 
accordance with the tenets of the Church in Wales as  a 
school, the premises of which have ceased to be used 
for the purposes of a school. 
Application for an Order making new provision for the 
use of the Endowment has been made to the Welsh 
Ministers by the St Davids Diocesan Trust, which 
body appears to the Welsh Ministers to be the 
appropriate authority of the Church in Wales for that 
purpose. 
Notice of the proposed Order and of the right of 
persons interested to make representations has been 
given in accordance with the provisions of section 555 
of the Education Act 1996. 
No representations have been made on the proposed 
Order. 
The Foundation assets consist of £59,295.60 being the 
net proceeds of sale of the premises of the former 
school comprised in the Founding deed, and also any 
income derived from those assets before the coming 
into force of this Order. 
By virtue of section 1 of the Reverter of Sites Act 1987 
(“the 1987 Act”) a trust has or may have arisen in 
 
 
3
relation to the site of the above school comprised in 
the Founding deed. The Welsh Ministers are satisfied 
that all reasonably practicable steps to trace any person 
who is, or who may become, entitled as a beneficiary 
under that trust have been taken and that there is no 
claim by any such person which comes within the 
provisions of section 5(2)(a) of the 1987 Act. 
The Welsh Ministers in exercise of the powers 
conferred on the Secretary of State by sections 554 and 
556 of the Education Act 1996(1) and section 5 of the 
Reverter of Sites Act 1987(2), and now vested in them 
make the following Order.

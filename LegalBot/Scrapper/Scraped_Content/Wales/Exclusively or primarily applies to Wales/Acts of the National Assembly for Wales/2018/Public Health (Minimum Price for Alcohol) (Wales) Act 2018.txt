Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Act 2018
2018 anaw 5
An Act of the National Assembly for Wales to make provision about the minimum price for which alcohol is to be supplied in Wales by certain persons; and for connected purposes.
[9 August 2018]
Having been passed by the National Assembly for Wales and having received the assent of Her Majesty, it is enacted as follows:1
Minimum price for alcohol
(1)
The applicable minimum price for alcohol is to be calculated, for the purposes of section 2 of this Act, by applying the formula M × S × V, where—
(a)
M is whatever price is specified in regulations as being the minimum unit price for the purposes of this Act, expressed in pounds sterling,
(b)
S is the percentage strength of the alcohol, expressed as a cardinal number,
(c)
V is the volume of the alcohol, expressed in litres.
(2)
Where but for this subsection the applicable minimum price for alcohol would not be a whole number of pennies, it is to be rounded to the nearest whole penny (taking half a penny as being nearest to the next whole penny above).
(3)
For example—
(a)
in the case of a bottle of wine, S (percentage strength of the wine) is 12.5%, and V (volume of the wine) is 75 centilitres;
(b)
taking M (specified minimum unit price) to be £0.50, the applicable minimum price for the wine would be calculated as £0.50 × 12.5 × 0.75 = £4.69.

Where alcohol is supplied in a multi-buy alcohol transaction, the applicable minimum price is to be calculated by reference to all of the alcohol included in the transaction.
(2)
Alcohol is supplied in a multi-buy alcohol transaction if—
(a)
it is supplied free of charge by reference to the supply of other alcohol, or
(b)
other alcohol is supplied free of charge by reference to it,
and, in either case, both the free alcohol and the alcohol by reference to which the free alcohol is supplied are to be treated as being included in the same transaction.

Alcohol is also supplied in a multi-buy alcohol transaction if—
(a)
it is supplied at a price fixed by reference to the supply of other alcohol, or

(b)
taking M (specified minimum unit price) to be £0.50, the applicable minimum price for the transaction is £8.80, that sum being the aggregate of the following calculations—

Special offers: supply of alcohol with goods and services
(1)
Where alcohol is supplied together with goods other than alcohol, or with services, for a single price, subsection (2) applies.
(2)
The alcohol is to be treated as being supplied at that single price for the purpose of determining whether the selling price of the alcohol is below the applicable minimum price.
(3)
For example—
(a)
in a special offer, the cans of lager and cider mentioned in the example given in section 5(6) are supplied with a pizza for a single price;
(b)
taking M (specified minimum unit price) to be £0.50, the selling price of the alcohol is to be treated for the purposes of this Act as being the total price of the cans and the pizza, and that price must not be lower than £8.80, being the applicable minimum price for the lager and cider.
(4)
Where alcohol is supplied for a price fixed by reference to the supply of goods other than alcohol, or of services (a “special price”), subsection (5) applies for the purpose of determining whether the selling price of the alcohol is below the applicable minimum price.
(5)
The alcohol is to be treated as being supplied at a price equal to the aggregate of the special price and the price (if any) for which the other goods and services are supplied.
(6)

in a special offer, the cans of lager and cider mentioned in the example given in section 5(6) are supplied for a special price if a pizza is purchased for £5.00;
(b)
taking M (specified minimum unit price) to be £0.50, the selling price of the alcohol is to be treated for the purposes of this Act as being the aggregate of the price of the pizza and the special price, and that special price must not be lower than £3.80, being the applicable minimum price for the cans of lager and cider (which is £8.80) less the price for the pizza (which is £5.00).

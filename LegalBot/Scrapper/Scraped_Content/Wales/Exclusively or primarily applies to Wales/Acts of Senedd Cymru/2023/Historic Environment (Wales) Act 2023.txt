(3)
The works in respect of which compensation is payable under this section are—
(a)
works which are reasonably necessary for carrying out any development for which planning permission—
(i)
had been granted (otherwise than by a general development order) before the monument in question became a scheduled monument, and
(ii)
was still effective when the application for scheduled monument consent was made,
(b)
works constituting development for which planning permission is granted by a general development order,
(c)
works which do not constitute development, and

works which are reasonably necessary for the continuation of a use of the monument for a purpose for which it was in use immediately before the date of the application for scheduled monument consent (but ignoring any use in breach of any legal restrictions applying to the use of the monument).
(4)
The compensation payable under this section in respect of works within subsection (3)(a) is limited to compensation for expenditure incurred or other loss or damage suffered by virtue of the fact that, in consequence of the Welsh Ministers’ decision, development for which the planning permission in question was granted could not be carried out without breaching section 11 (requirement for works to be authorised).

A person is not entitled to compensation under this section in respect of any works within subsection (3)(b) or (c) if the works in question or any of them would or might result in the total or partial demolition or destruction of the monument.
(6)
Where scheduled monument consent is granted subject to conditions, a person is not entitled to compensation under this section in respect of any works within subsection (3)(d) unless compliance with those conditions would in effect make it impossible to use the monument for the purpose for which it was in use before the date of the application.
(7)
In assessing any compensation payable under this section for loss or damage consisting of depreciation of the value of an interest in land—
(a)
it is to be assumed that any subsequent application for scheduled monument consent for works of a similar description would be determined in the same way, but
(b)
in the case of a refusal of scheduled monument consent, if the Welsh Ministers, on refusing that consent, undertook to grant consent for other works affecting the monument in the event of an application being made, regard must be had to that undertaking.
(8)
A claim for compensation under this section must be made in writing within 6 months beginning with the day of—
(a)
the notice of refusal of scheduled monument consent, or
(b)
the grant of scheduled monument consent.

in a case where compensation under that section was paid in consequence of the grant of scheduled monument consent subject to conditions, the Welsh Ministers subsequently—
(i)
modify the consent so that the conditions, or any of them, no longer apply to all or any of the works in respect of which the compensation was paid, or
(ii)
grant a new consent for all or any of those works free from those conditions, or any of them.
(2)
This section does not apply in any case unless the Welsh Ministers have served notice of the payment of compensation on the council of every county or county borough in which the monument is situated.
(3)
In granting or modifying a scheduled monument consent in a case to which this section applies, the Welsh Ministers may do so on terms that no works in respect of which the compensation was paid are to be carried out under the consent until the recoverable amount has been repaid to the Welsh Ministers or secured to their satisfaction.
(4)
In subsection (3) “recoverable amount” has the meaning given by section 23.
(5)

the monument affected by the decision, and
(c)
the amount of the compensation.

The direction must state the reasons for which it is given and must be served on—
(a)
the person, if any, appointed to determine the appeal,
(b)
the appellant,
(c)
the planning authority, and
(d)

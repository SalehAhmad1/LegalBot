The number arrived at—

Allocation of seats

(2)
The second and subsequent seats for the constituency are to be allocated to the party or individual candidate with the highest seat allocation figure after any recalculation required by subsection (3) has been carried out.
(3)
This subsection requires a recalculation of the seat allocation figure for a registered political party—
(a)
for the first application of subsection (2), if the application of subsection (1) resulted in the allocation to the party of a seat for the constituency, or
(b)
for any subsequent application of subsection (2), if the previous application of that subsection resulted in the allocation to the party of a seat for the constituency,
and each recalculation is to be carried out under section 8(2)(b) after adding one to the previous seat allocation divisor for that party.
(4)
An individual candidate already allocated a seat as a Member of the Senedd for the constituency is to be disregarded when applying subsection (2).
(5)
Seats for the constituency that are allocated to a party are to be filled by the candidates on the party’s list in the order in which they appear on the list.

Once a party’s list has been exhausted (by the application of subsection (1) or (2)), the party is to be disregarded when applying subsection (2).
(7)
If, on the application of subsection (1) or on an application of subsection (2), the highest seat allocation figure is the seat allocation figure for two or more parties or individual candidates (referred to in subsection (8) as the “tied seat allocation figure”), subsection (1) or (2) (as the case may be) applies to each of them.
(8)
But if subsection (7) would mean that more than the full number of seats for the constituency were allocated, subsection (1) or (2) is not to be applied until—
(a)
a recalculation of the seat allocation figure for any party with the tied seat allocation figure has been carried out under section 8(2)(b) after adding one to the number arrived at under section 8(2)(a), and
(b)
one has been added to the number arrived at under section 8(4) for any individual candidate with the tied seat allocation figure.
(9)
If, after that, the highest seat allocation figure is still the seat allocation figure for two or more parties or individual candidates (so it is still the case that more than the full number of seats for the constituency would be allocated), the constituency returning officer must decide between them by lots.”

“PART 3A
SENEDD CONSTITUENCY BOUNDARY REVIEWS
49A
Senedd constituency boundary reviews
(1)
The Commission must conduct a Senedd constituency boundary review once in every review period.
(2)
A Senedd constituency boundary review is a review of the Senedd constituencies for the purpose of determining whether those boundaries should change in order to give effect to the rules set out in section 49C.
(3)
If in the course of a review the Commission determines that the boundaries of a Senedd constituency should change, the Commission must also determine—
(a)
what the names of the affected constituencies should be;
(b)
whether each affected constituency should be a county constituency or a borough constituency.
(4)
But if in the course of a review the Commission determines that, while the boundaries of a Senedd constituency should not change, the name of the constituency or its designation as a county constituency or a borough constituency should change, it may determine—
(a)
what the name of the constituency should be;
(b)
whether it should be a county constituency or a borough constituency.
(5)
For the purpose of subsection (1), “review period” means—
(a)

(1)
The electorate for each Senedd constituency must be—
(a)
no less than 90% of the electoral quota, and

no more than 110% of the electoral quota.
(2)
When considering during a Senedd constituency boundary review whether there should be changes to the Senedd constituencies, and what those changes should be—
(a)
the Commission may have regard to—
(i)
local government boundaries that exist or are prospective on the review date;
(ii)
special geographical considerations, including in particular the size, shape and accessibility of a proposed or existing Senedd constituency;
(iii)
any local ties (including local ties connected to the use of the Welsh language) that would be broken by such changes; but
(b)
in any event the Commission must—
(i)
seek to minimise the amount of change to the Senedd constituencies that exist on the review date, and
(ii)
have regard to the inconveniences caused by making changes to the Senedd constituencies.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (1)—
(a)
the electorate is the total number of local government electors, and
(b)
the electoral quota is the electorate of Wales divided by 16 (which is the number of Senedd constituencies), and
for the purposes of paragraph (a), a local government elector is a person registered in the relevant version of the register of local government electors at an address within a Senedd constituency.
(4)
The relevant version of the register of local government electors is the version that is, on the review date, the most recent version published under section 13(1)(a) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. ‍2).
(5)
In the case of a local government boundary that is prospective on the review date, it is that boundary (rather than any existing boundary that it replaces) that must be taken into account under subsection (2)(a)(i).
(6)
A local government boundary is “prospective” on the review date if, on that date—
(a)
it is specified in a provision of—
(i)
primary legislation, or
(ii)
an instrument made under primary legislation, and
(b)
the provision specifying the boundary is not yet in force for all purposes.

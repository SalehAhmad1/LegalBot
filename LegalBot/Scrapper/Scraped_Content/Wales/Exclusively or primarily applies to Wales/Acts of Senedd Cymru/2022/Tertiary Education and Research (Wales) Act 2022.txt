(a)
the governing body of the provider applies to the Commission for the provider to be removed from that category of the register, and
(b)
the application complies with any requirements imposed under subsection (6).
(2)
But if the application under subsection (1)(a) specifies that it is combined with an application under section 25(4)(a) for registration in another category, the duty in subsection (1) does not apply unless the condition in subsection (3) applies or both of the conditions in subsection (4) apply.

that the Commission would be required to register the provider in the other category if the provider is removed from the category in respect of which the application under subsection (1)(a) is made.

(a)
an application for a review under section 45(d) could be brought in respect of the decision to remove, or

a review or a decision by the Commission following a such review is pending.
(10)
But that does not prevent a removal taking effect if the governing body of the provider notifies the Commission that it does not intend to apply for a review.
(11)
Where subsection (9) ceases to prevent a removal taking effect on the date specified under subsection (7), the Commission must determine a future date on which the removal takes effect.

But that is subject to what has been determined by the Commission following any review under section 45(d) in respect of the decision to remove.
(13)
The Welsh Ministers may, by regulations, make transitional or saving provision in connection with the removal of a provider from a category of the register under this section.

Powers to intervene
(1)
If the Welsh Ministers are satisfied that one or more of the grounds for intervention exist in relation to a tertiary education provider in Wales that is an institution within the further education sector, the Welsh Ministers may give a direction to the provider’s governing body.
(2)
Before giving a direction under this section, the Welsh Ministers must consult the Commission.
(3)
A direction under this section may—
(a)
contain provision that has effect to remove all or any of the members of the provider’s governing body;
(b)
contain provision that has effect to appoint new members of that body if there are vacancies (however arising);
(c)
specify steps that are (or are not) to be taken by the governing body for the purpose of dealing with the grounds of intervention.
(4)
A direction under subsection (3)(c) may (among other things) require the governing body⁠—
(a)
to exercise powers under section 5(2)(b) to (f) and (h) of the Education (Wales) Measure 2011 (nawm 7) to collaborate with such persons and on such terms as may be specified in the direction;
(b)
to make a resolution under section 27A(1) of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 (c. 13) (“the 1992 Act”) for the body to be dissolved on a date specified in the direction.
(5)
A governing body to which a direction such as is mentioned in subsection (4)(b) is given is to be taken for the purposes of section 27A(1) of the 1992 Act to have complied with section 27 of that Act before making the resolution required by the direction.
(6)
Directions may be given under this section despite any enactment making the exercise of a power or discharge of a duty contingent on a governing body’s opinion.
(7)
The Welsh Ministers may not direct a governing body under this section to dismiss a member of staff.
(8)
But subsection (7) does not prevent the Welsh Ministers, where they consider that it may be appropriate to dismiss a member of staff whom the governing body has power under the provider’s articles of government to dismiss, from giving the governing body such directions under this section as are necessary to secure that the procedures applicable to the consideration of the case for dismissal of that member of staff are given effect to in relation to that member of staff.
(9)
An appointment of a member of a governing body under this section has effect as if made in accordance with the instrument of government and articles of government of the provider concerned.

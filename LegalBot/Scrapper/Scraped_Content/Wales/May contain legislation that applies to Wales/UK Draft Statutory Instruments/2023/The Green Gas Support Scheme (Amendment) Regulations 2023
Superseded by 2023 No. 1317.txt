Parliamentary Under Secretary of State
Department for Energy Security and Net ZeroEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in Great Britain, amend the Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 (“the 2021 Regulations”), which established the Green Gas Support Scheme (“the GGSS”) and the Green Gas Levy (“the GGL”). The GGSS is a renewable heat incentive scheme to facilitate and encourage the production of biomethane by anaerobic digestion, for injection into the gas grid. The GGSS is funded by the GGL, which imposes a levy on licensed gas suppliers. These Regulations make amendments to the GGL only.
Regulation 4 corrects a drafting error in the formula used to calculate the levy rate: interest accrued on GGL funds held in Ofgem’s bank account should be deducted from (rather than added to) the annual collection target. It also makes amendments to the process by which the Secretary of State can amend the Maximum Levy Amount.
Regulations 5 and 6 make amendments in relation to credit cover. In particular, they amend the formula used to calculate the credit cover requirement for new suppliers joining the scheme. They also provide that the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (the “Authority”) can re-issue a credit cover notice where a supplier’s credit cover has been drawn due prior to the start of a quarter due to a mutualisation event.
Regulation 7 provides for the Secretary of State to set a de minimis threshold in relation to each scheme year. The de minimis threshold applies to certain GGL payment obligations and a supplier’s credit cover requirement. Obligations to pay amounts below the de minimis threshold are automatically disapplied or reduced to £0.
Regulation 8 makes amendments to the procedure to be followed when a scheme supplier ceases to be a scheme supplier, other than by virtue of becoming an exempt supplier.
Regulation 9 provides that the Authority may draw down on a scheme supplier’s credit cover in relation to interest that has accrued on certain unpaid payments. It also makes other minor amendments to the credit cover draw down procedure.
Regulation 10 makes amendment to the conditions that must be satisfied for the mutualisation process to take place.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

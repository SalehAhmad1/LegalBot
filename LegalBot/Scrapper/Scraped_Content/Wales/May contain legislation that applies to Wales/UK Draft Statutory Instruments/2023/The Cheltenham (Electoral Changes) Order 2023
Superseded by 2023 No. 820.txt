(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes changes to electoral arrangements for the borough of Cheltenham following recommendations made by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. The area of the borough remains unchanged.
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral wards of the borough of Cheltenham and replaces them with 20 new ones. It establishes the names and areas of the new electoral wards and the number of councillors for each.
Article 4 makes provision for a whole borough council election in 2024. Subsequently, the council will revert to the existing system of election by halves. That article also provides for the order of retirement of councillors in 2026 and 2028 and the election of their replacements.
Article 5 makes changes to parish wards that are consequential on the changes made by article 3, those changes coming into force in relation to elections occurring in 2026 and in respect of subsequent parish elections.
The area covered by each ward created by this Order is identified on a map which is available for inspection at reasonable times at the offices of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, 1st Floor, Windsor House, 50 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0TL.

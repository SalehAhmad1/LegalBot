(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision under section 3(1) of the Professional Qualifications Act 2022 (c. 20) (“the 2022 Act”) to implement provisions relating to the recognition of professional qualifications contained in the free trade agreement between Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland done at London on 8th July 2021 (“the EEA EFTA free trade agreement”).
Part 2 establishes rules for the recognition of professional qualifications obtained in a specified state. The specified states are listed in Schedule 1 to these Regulations.
Part 3 establishes rules for the provision of information by regulators and dealing with enquiries from professionals who have obtained professional qualifications in a specified state.
Schedule 3 contains amendments to sectoral legislation for the purpose of, and in connection with, implementing provisions relating to the recognition of professional qualifications in the EEA EFTA free trade agreement.
These Regulations also make amendments, in Schedule 4, to sectoral legislation consequent upon the commencement of section 5(1) of the 2022 Act and revoking other EU recognition law. Section 5(1) revokes the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/2059) which provided a general system of recognition for qualifications from the European Economic Area and Switzerland. Commencement regulations will bring section 5(1) of the 2022 Act into force on the same day as this instrument comes into force.
An impact assessment has not been produced as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is available alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk. A copy has also been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

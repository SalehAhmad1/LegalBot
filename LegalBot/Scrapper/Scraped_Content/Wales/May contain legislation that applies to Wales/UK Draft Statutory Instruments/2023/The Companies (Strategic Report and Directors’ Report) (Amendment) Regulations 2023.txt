These Regulations require certain companies to provide additional statements to be included in the strategic report and the directors’ report. The provisions apply to a company with a high level of employees and turnover.
The Regulations commence on 1st January 2025. In general, the Regulations have effect in respect of a financial year of a company which commences on or after 1st January 2026. In the case of a company whose equity share capital is admitted to trading on a UK regulated market, for the whole of the financial year of the company which commences on or after 1st January 2025, the Regulations have effect in respect of that financial year and each subsequent financial year.
Part 2 inserts section 413A which requires relevant companies to include an additional note to the accounts concerning distributable profits and other relevant matters or a minimum amount recorded under section 413A(7). Part 2 also inserts sections 414CC,CD and CE which define a company with a high level of employees and turnover and place a duty on the company’s directors to include a resilience statement in the company’s strategic report. In addition, regulation 5 amends the offence provision which is set out in section 414D(2).
Part 3 inserts sections 416A–C, which place a duty on the company’s directors to include three additional statements in the directors’ report. The statements comprise an audit and assurance policy statement, a material fraud statement and a policy statement concerning distributions and purchase of own shares.
Section 416A inserts the audit and assurance policy statement which must be included in the directors’ report in every third financial year with an update in the intervening financial years.

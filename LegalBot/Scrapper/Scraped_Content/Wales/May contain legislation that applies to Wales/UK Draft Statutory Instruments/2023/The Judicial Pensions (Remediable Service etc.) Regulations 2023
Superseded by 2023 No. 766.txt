(3) The first condition is that the service in question took place in the period beginning with 1st 
April 2015 and ending with 31st March 2022. 
(4) The second condition is that the service— 
(a) is pensionable service under a judicial legacy scheme, or 
(b) would have been pensionable service under a judicial scheme but for the fact that the 
person, in accordance with the scheme, opted that it should not be (or failed to opt that it 
should be) pensionable service under the scheme. 
(5) The second condition is met if all of the service in question falls within paragraph (4)(a) and 
(b) (even if it does not fall within only one of those paragraphs). 
(6) The third condition is that there is no disqualifying gap in service(c) falling within the 
period— 
(a) beginning with the day after the most recent day in relation to which section 103(3)(c)

the scheme that service should not be pensionable service under a judicial scheme if the service 
would have been pensionable service under that scheme (or would have been if the person had 
opted that it should be) but for the fact that the person had a partnership pension account. 
(8) This Part does not apply in relation to any payment or transfer of assets and liabilities that 
would otherwise be payable or required to be made under this Part where a corresponding 
payment or a corresponding transfer of assets and liabilities has been made.

a “corresponding payment” is a payment that has been made in relation to R’s relevant service 
that corresponds to a payment that is payable or required to be made under this Part;

(a) R’s relevant service is “PPA opted-out relevant service” if and to the extent that R made 
contributions to a partnership pension account in respect of it;

(a) references to the relevant judicial legacy salaried scheme were references to the Part 4 
judicial legacy salaried scheme; 
(b) the reference in section 41(3)(c) to the appropriate person were a reference to the relevant 
person.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
The Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25) (“PSPA 2013”) makes provision, and confers 
powers to make further provision (in the form of “scheme regulations” as defined in section 1 of 
PSPA 2013), about the establishment of public service pension schemes. The Judicial Pensions 
Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/182) (“the 2015 Regulations”) are the scheme regulations establishing 
the successor judicial pension scheme (“the 2015 scheme”) to the judicial legacy schemes (as 
defined in section 70(3) of the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7) 
(“PSPJOA 2022”)). The 2015 Regulations provided for transitional protection for certain cohorts 
of judicial legacy scheme members. This transitional protection was subsequently found to 
unlawfully discriminate between judicial pension scheme members on the basis of age. 
The PSPJOA 2022, at Chapter 2, makes provision, and confers powers for scheme regulations 
under PSPA 2013 to make further provision, in relation to specified service (“remediable service” 
as defined in section 39 of PSPJOA 2022) of members who benefitted from transitional protection, 
 
43
and of members who did not benefit from transitional protection only by reason of their age. 
Section 62 of PSPJOA 2022 requires certain powers to make scheme regulations to be exercised in 
accordance with Treasury directions. 
These Regulations are scheme regulations under PSPA 2013 and in accordance with PSPJOA 
2022 in relation to a member’s remediable service in the judicial legacy schemes and in the 2015 
scheme. They are, to the extent required by section 62 of PSPJOA 2022, made in accordance with 
Treasury directions under that section (in the form of the Public Service Pensions (Exercise of 
Powers, Compensation and Information) Directions 2022). These Regulations have retrospective 
effect, which is authorised by section 3(3)(b) of PSPA 2013. 
Part 1 of these Regulations contains provision about, among other things, governance, including 
the delegation of functions, a requirement to establish a procedure for consideration of appeals, 
and the relationship between the scheme manager and the Judicial Pension Board when exercising 
a discretion. 
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision about special cases where a member has remediable 
service and an immediate detriment remedy (within the meaning of section 68 of PSPJOA 2022) 
has not been obtained in relation to that service— 
(a) Chapter 2 makes provision about cases where a member makes an election for legacy 
scheme benefits and they have previously exercised, in relation to their remediable 
service, options to purchase additional rights in the 2015 scheme, or to transfer rights out 
of the 2015 scheme; 
(b) Chapter 3 makes provision about cases where a member has previously exercised a partial 
retirement option under either the 2015 scheme or the judicial legacy fee-paid scheme (as 
defined in section 70(5) of PSPJOA 2022), and the member makes an election for 
benefits in the other scheme; 
(c) Chapter 4 makes provision about the payment by a judicial scheme of annual allowance 
charges. 
Part 3 makes provision about cases where an immediate detriment remedy has been obtained in 
relation to a member’s remediable service— 
(a) Chapter 2 makes provision about the provision of information in relation to a member’s 
rights and liabilities under PSPJOA 2022 and these Regulations; 
(b) Chapter 3 makes provision about a requirement to transfer and surrender rights in relation 
to any remediable service that is PPA opted-out service (as defined in section 73(2) of 
PSPJOA 2022); 
(c) Chapter 4 makes provision about the benefits payable to a child survivor of a member 
who died before the immediate detriment remedy was obtained; 
(d) Chapter 5 makes provision about a partial retirement option exercised in respect of a fee-
paid judicial office; 
(e) Chapters 6 and 7 make provision about the treatment, including the correction, of benefits 
and contributions previously paid or payable; 
(f) Chapter 8 makes provision about the payment of compensation for voluntary 
contributions paid to purchase additional pension rights; 
(g) Chapter 9 makes provision about the repayment of a transitional protection allowance (as 
defined in section 54(4) of PSPJOA 2022); 
(h) Chapter 10 makes provision about the payment of compensation; 
(i) Chapter 11 makes provision about unauthorised payments (within the meaning of section 
63(5) of PSPJOA 2022). 
Part 4 makes provision in relation to certain fee-paid judges which is similar to the provision made 
by Part 3 in relation to cases where an immediate detriment remedy has been obtained.

Part 5 makes provision about cases in which the value of pension rights secured by virtue of a 
member’s remediable service are to be shared under a pension sharing order in accordance with 
section 29 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 (c. 30). It provides, in particular, for the 
calculation or, where appropriate, the re-calculation of the value of a pension debit and a pension 
credit in relation to the rights. 
Part 6 makes provision about any amounts owed to or by a person as a result of PSPJOA 2022, 
these Regulations or an immediate detriment remedy— 
(a) Chapter 1 makes provision about the calculation of interest; 
(b) Chapter 2 makes provision about the reduction and waiver of an amount owed, in 
particular a requirement for the scheme manager to reduce some amounts by tax relief 
amounts and the discretion of the scheme manager to reduce or waive relevant amounts 
owed by a person to a scheme in certain circumstances; 
(c) Chapter 3 makes provision about netting off amounts owed to and by a person; 
(d) Chapter 4 makes provision about when and how relevant amounts must be paid. 
Part 7, together with the Schedule, makes provision amending other legislation— 
(a) Part 1 of the Schedule amends various instruments by virtue of, and in consequence of, 
PSPJOA 2022 and in consequence of these Regulations; 
(b) Part 2— 
(i) at paragraphs 5 and 6, amends the Judicial Pensions (Contributions) Regulations 
1998 (S.I. 1998/1219) and the Judicial Pensions (Fee-Paid Judges) Regulations 2017 
(S.I. 2017/522) to adjust the rate payable in relation to dependants contributions with 
effect from 1st April 2016; 
(ii) at paragraph 7, amends the Judicial Pensions (Fee-Paid Judges) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/444) to expand the window during which a previous 
service contributions amount owed under those Regulations may be paid by way of a 
lump sum; 
(iii) at paragraph 8, amends the Judicial Pensions Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/319) in 
relation to the calculation of the retirement adjustment index with effect from 1st 
April 2022. 
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact 
on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been 
published alongside these Regulations on http://www.legislation.gov.uk.

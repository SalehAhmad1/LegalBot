Paragraph (3) provides that for those instruments listed in Part 3 of Schedule 1, the extent of the disapplication is Northern Ireland only. Paragraph (4) provides that the revocation of an instrument or provision of an instrument in Schedule 2 has the same extent as the instrument to which it relates.
Regulation 4 provides that the sunset of subordinate legislation and retained direct EU legislation by section 1(1) of the Act and listed in Schedule 1 to that Act does not apply to the instruments listed in Schedule 1 to these Regulations, to the extent specified there. This has the effect of preserving the instruments, which were included in the Act’s revocation Schedule, from revocation at the end of 2023.

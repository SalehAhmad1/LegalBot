(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations transfer the functions conferred on Health Education England (“HEE”) by the Care Act 2014 (c. 23) to NHS England (see regulation 4).
HEE and NHS England are bodies corporate established under section 96 of the Care Act 2014 and section 1H of the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41) respectively.
The transfer of functions is given effect by making amendments to the National Health Service Act 2006, the Health and Social Care Act 2012 (c. 7) and the Care Act 2014, as well as consequential amendments to other pieces of primary and secondary legislation (see regulation 4(1) and (2), and Schedules 1 and 2).
The Regulations also abolish HEE (see regulation 4(3)), make transitional provision about final reports and accounts in relation to HEE (see regulations 5 and 6), and make transitional provision in relation to the winding up of HEE’s affairs, legal proceedings, references to HEE in enactments and other instruments, and in documents and forms (see regulation 7).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

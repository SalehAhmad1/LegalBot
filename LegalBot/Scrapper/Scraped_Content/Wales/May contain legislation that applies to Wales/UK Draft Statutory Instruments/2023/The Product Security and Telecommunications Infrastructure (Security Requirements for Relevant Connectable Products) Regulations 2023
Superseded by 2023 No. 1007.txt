These Regulations also set out what connectable products are excepted from the scope of the regulatory regime and further set out requirements in relation to the statement of compliance for relevant connectable products for manufacturers and importers.
Schedule 1 sets out the security requirements with which manufacturers of relevant connectable products have to comply in relation to UK consumer connectable products.
Schedule 2 sets out conditions which, if met, will deem the manufacturer compliant with the relevant corresponding security requirement.
Schedule 3 sets out the list of products to be excepted from being considered relevant connectable products for the purposes of section 4 (relevant connectable products) of the Act.
Schedule 4 sets out the minimum amount of information which is required to be stated in a statement of compliance.
A draft of these Regulations has been notified to World Trade Organisation under the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement (notification G/TBT/N/GBR/62), as well as to the EU Commission under the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive (notification 2023/7004/XI).

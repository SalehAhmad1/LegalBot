The Treasury may only make location regulations—

following compliance with the procedural requirements of paragraph 2cb.

Location regulations including an adaptation period may specify—
(a)
conditions with which the third-country CCP must comply in order to continue to provide clearing services or activities described in the location regulations during the adaptation period;
(b)
measures that must be taken during the adaptation period, in order to limit the potential costs to clearing members and their clients, in particular those established in the United Kingdom.

The recommendation must include advice—
(a)
explaining how compliance with the conditions set out in paragraph 2b would not sufficiently address the financial stability risk for the United Kingdom;
(b)
describing the characteristics of the clearing services provided by the CCP, including the liquidity and physical settlement requirements associated with the provision of such services;

(ii)
the potential consequences of including the outstanding contracts held at the CCP within the scope of the location direction;
(d)
where relevant, addressing the duration of the adaptation period mentioned in the fourth subparagraph of paragraph 2c and any conditions or measures the Bank of England proposes to be included in the location regulations (see the fifth subparagraph of paragraph 2c).

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively (see in particular paragraphs (a), (b) and (g) of section 8(2) of that Act) and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations are made following the amendment of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (“the EMIR regulation”) by Regulation (EU) 2019/2099 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 (OJ L 322/1, 12.12.2019) (“the EMIR CCP Supervision regulation”).
The Regulations make amendments to primary legislation, existing regulations made under section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and the EMIR regulation to take account of the fact that the EMIR regulation has been amended by the EMIR CCP Supervision regulation.
Part 2 amends the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (c.8).
Part 3 amends subordinate legislation.
Part 4 amends the EMIR regulation.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

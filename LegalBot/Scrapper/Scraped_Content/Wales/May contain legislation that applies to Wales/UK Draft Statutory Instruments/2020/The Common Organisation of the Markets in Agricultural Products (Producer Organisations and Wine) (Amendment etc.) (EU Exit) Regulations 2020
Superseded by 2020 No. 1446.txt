(a)
holds the share or capital in question; or
(b)
is part of a chain of persons:
(i)
each of whom (other than the last) has a majority stake in the person immediately below it in the chain; and
(ii)
the last of whom holds the share or capital.
7.  An association of producer organisations must provide in its members’ agreements and statutes for each member that is a producer organisation to have one voting right.
8.  An association of producer organisations may provide in its members’ agreements and statutes for producer members that are not producer organisations to have voting rights, provided that:
(a)
such members must not be permitted to hold more than one voting right each;
(b)
the total share of the voting rights exercisable by such members must be less than a majority of the total number of voting rights exercisable in respect of each relevant decision.”.

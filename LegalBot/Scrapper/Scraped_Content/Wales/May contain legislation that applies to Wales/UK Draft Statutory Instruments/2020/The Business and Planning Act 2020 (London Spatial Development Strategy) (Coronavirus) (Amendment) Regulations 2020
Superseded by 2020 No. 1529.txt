DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend section 21(2) of the Business and Planning Act 2020 (c. 16) (“the 2020 Act”) to substitute the date of 31st December 2020, the date specified as being when that section expires, with 31st December 2021.
In response to the coronavirus pandemic, section 21(1) of the 2020 Act temporarily modifies section 43 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 (c. 29) (“the GLA Act”). It temporarily disapplies the requirement on the Mayor of London to keep his current spatial development strategy available for inspection at the Greater London Authority’s principal offices and at such other places as the Mayor considers appropriate, if the strategy is available for inspection free of charge by appropriate electronic means. It also temporarily disapplies the requirement on the Mayor to provide a hard copy of the strategy on request, if the strategy is available for inspection free of charge by appropriate electronic means.
Section 21(2) of the 2020 Act provides that this modification of section 43 of the GLA Act expires at the end of 31st December 2020. These Regulations extend the application of the modification to the end of 31st December 2021.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

Part 2 amends exit-related legislation, Parts 3 and 4 amend domestic legislation and Part 5 amends retained EU legislation in the area of veterinary medicines and residues. The amendments in Part 3 include provisions facilitating the access to the market within Great Britain of qualifying Northern Ireland goods.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

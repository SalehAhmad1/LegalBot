sections 12 and 41 of, and paragraph 12 of Schedule 4 to, the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c.1).
Part 2 amends the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/2059) (“the 2015 Regulations”) in exercise of powers conferred by the European Communities Act 1972 (c. 68).
Part 3 amends EU Exit S.I.s. In particular, the amendments make transitional provision relating to the following agreements made between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and the United Kingdom and the EFTA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland)—

the EEA EFTA separation agreement signed at London on 2 April 2019 on arrangements between Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the EEA Agreement and other agreements applicable between the United Kingdom and the EEA EFTA States by virtue of the United Kingdom’s membership of the European Union; and
the Swiss citizens’ rights agreement signed at Bern on 25 February 2019 between the United Kingdom and the Swiss Confederation on citizens’ rights following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and the free movement of persons agreement,
so far as those agreements relate to the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and the temporary and occasional provision of professional services.

replace the existing transitional provisions, in particular to make further provision for administrative cooperation in accordance with the Withdrawal Agreement, EEA EFTA separation agreement and Swiss citizens’ rights agreement, and for extended rights to provide professional services and for recognition of a professional qualification in accordance with the Swiss citizens’ rights agreement; and
amend provisions amending the Education (School Teachers’ Qualifications) (England) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/1662).

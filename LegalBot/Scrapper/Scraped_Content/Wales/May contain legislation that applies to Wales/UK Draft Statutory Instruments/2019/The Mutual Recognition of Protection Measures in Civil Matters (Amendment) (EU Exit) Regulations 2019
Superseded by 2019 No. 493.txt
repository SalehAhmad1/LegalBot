DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular as specified in section 8(2)(c) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation applying in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland, in the field of the mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters. (A protection measure is a court order or other legally binding decision which imposes restrictions on an individual who has caused a threat to, and on whom obligations have been imposed in respect of, another individual.) The amendments provide for the continued recognition and enforcement, in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, of protection measures ordered in a Member State. Part 2 amends the Senior Courts Act 1981, and Part 3 amends the Family Court (Composition and Distribution of Business) Rules 2014 and the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments (Protection Measures) Regulations 2014. Part 4 amends Regulation (EU) 606/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 June 2013 on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations designate National Highways as a relevant public authority for the purposes of Part 4 of the Environment Act 1995 (c.25) (“the Act”), as amended by the Environment Act 2021 (c.30).
Designation as a relevant public authority confers on National Highways duties to have regard to the national air quality strategy under Part 4 of the Act when exercising any function of a public nature that could affect air quality, and to act as an air quality partner of a local authority where it has been identified by that authority as having functions in relation to a source of emissions contributing to a failure to achieve air quality standards or objectives in its area.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary, or public sectors is foreseen.

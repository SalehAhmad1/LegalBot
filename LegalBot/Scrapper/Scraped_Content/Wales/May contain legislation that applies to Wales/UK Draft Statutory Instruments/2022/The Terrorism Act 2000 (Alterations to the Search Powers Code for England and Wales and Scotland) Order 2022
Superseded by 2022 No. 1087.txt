(This note is not part of the Order)
The Secretary of State has made alterations to the search powers code for England and Wales and Scotland. The alterations (a) reflect the creation of the new power in section 43C of the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) under which a constable may stop and search terrorist offenders released on licence, and (b) make other minor changes. The new stop and search power applies when a terrorist offender’s licence includes a search condition and the constable is satisfied that the search is necessary for purposes connected with protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism.
This Order brings the alterations into force following their approval by each House of Parliament.
A copy of the revised code of practice referred to in this instrument is available publicly online at www.gov.uk and hard copies can be obtained by writing to the Home Office, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.

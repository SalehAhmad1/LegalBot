(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Microchipping of Dogs (England) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/108) (“the Microchipping Regulations 2015”).
The Microchipping Regulations 2015 require that, from 6th April 2016, subject to exceptions, all keepers of dogs in England must have their dog microchipped with their details and their dog’s details recorded on a database. They set standards for the microchips and mandatory conditions for database operators. They also establish a regime to enforce breaches of the statutory requirements.
Regulation 2 amends the Microchipping Regulations 2015 to extend the period during which they apply, so that they continue to have effect until the end of the period of nine years, rather than seven years, beginning with the day on which they came into force.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no new impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

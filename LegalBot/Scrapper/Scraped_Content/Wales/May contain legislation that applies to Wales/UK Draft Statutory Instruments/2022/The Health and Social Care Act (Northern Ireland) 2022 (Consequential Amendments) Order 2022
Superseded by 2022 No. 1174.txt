Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes amendments consequential on the Health and Social Care Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 3 (N.I.)) (the “2022 Act”).
The 2022 Act provides for the dissolution of the Regional Health and Social Care Board and the transfer of its functions to the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Care trusts. This Order makes consequential amendments amending references to the Regional Health and Social Care Board to instead reference the Northern Ireland Department of Health or Health and Social Care trusts.
This Order makes additional amendments updating references to other Northern Ireland health bodies which were not previously updated to reflect the reorganisation outlined in the Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009 (c. 1 (N.I.)).
The amendments are grouped together by territorial extent. Most of the amendments do not extend to Northern Ireland because the same amendments have already been made in the 2022 Act to the extent that the provisions being amended extend to Northern Ireland.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

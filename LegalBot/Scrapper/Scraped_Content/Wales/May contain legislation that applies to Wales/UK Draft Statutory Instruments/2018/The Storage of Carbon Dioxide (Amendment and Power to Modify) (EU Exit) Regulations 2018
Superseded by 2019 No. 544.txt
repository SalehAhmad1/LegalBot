DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (f) and (g) of section 8(2) of the 2018 Act) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. Part 3 of these Regulations is made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c. 68) and makes other minor corrections (which come into force before exit day).
Parts 2 and 3 of these Regulations make amendments to secondary legislation in the field of environmental protection and, in particular, amend legislation relating to the geological storage of carbon dioxide. Part 4 of the Regulations gives the Secretary of State the power to modify technical requirements applicable to storage sites regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

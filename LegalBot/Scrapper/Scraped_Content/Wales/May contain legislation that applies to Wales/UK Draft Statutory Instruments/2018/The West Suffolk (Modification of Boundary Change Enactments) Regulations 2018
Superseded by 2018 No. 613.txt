(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations modify provisions related to boundary changes in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 (the 2007 Act) as they apply to West Suffolk.

Section 8 of the 2007 Act is modified to allow for a proposal for boundary change affecting its area to be made by a relevant local authority without the requirement of a review or recommendation from the Local Government Boundary Commission.
Regulation 4 provides for the relevant provisions of the 2007 Act as modified by these Regulations to apply to the implementation of a proposal made before the coming into force of these Regulations.
Regulation 5 provides for the expiry of these Regulations at the end of March 2020.

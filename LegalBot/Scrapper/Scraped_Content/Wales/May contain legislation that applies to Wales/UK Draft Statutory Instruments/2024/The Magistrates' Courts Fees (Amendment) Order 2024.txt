(This note is not part of the Order)
By virtue of section 180(1) Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 (c. 12) (“the Act”), the Lord Chancellor may, with the consent of the Treasury, prescribe certain court fees of an amount which is intended to exceed the cost of the matter in respect of which the fee is charged. Under section 180(7) of the Act the use of that power is subject to the affirmative Parliamentary procedure.
This Order amends the Magistrates’ Courts Fees Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/1052) by restating the value of the fee for an application for a liability order in proceedings under the Council Tax (Administration and Enforcement) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992/613) or the Non-Domestic Rating (Collection and Enforcement) (Local Lists) Regulations 1989 (S.I. 1989/1058) in reliance on s. 180(1) of the Act, thereby authorising that the fee may recover an amount which exceeds the cost to His Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service of processing such applications.

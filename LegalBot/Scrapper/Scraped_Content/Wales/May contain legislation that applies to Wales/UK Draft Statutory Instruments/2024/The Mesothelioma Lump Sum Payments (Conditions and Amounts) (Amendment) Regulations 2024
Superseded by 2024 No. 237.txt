DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Schedule to the Mesothelioma Lump Sum Payments (Conditions and Amounts) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/1963) (“the 2008 Regulations”) by substituting revised tables of the amount of lump sum payments payable to people with diffuse mesothelioma or to their surviving dependants.
The substituted tables have the effect of increasing the amounts payable under the 2008 Regulations by 6.7 per cent in each case, rounded up or down to the nearest £1 as appropriate.
The amendments made by these Regulations will apply in respect of a claim—
by a person who was first diagnosed with diffuse mesothelioma on or after 1st April 2024,
made on or after 1st April 2024 by a person with diffuse mesothelioma where the date of diagnosis is unknown, or
by a dependant of a person who died on or after 1st April 2024 and who, immediately before their death, had diffuse mesothelioma.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

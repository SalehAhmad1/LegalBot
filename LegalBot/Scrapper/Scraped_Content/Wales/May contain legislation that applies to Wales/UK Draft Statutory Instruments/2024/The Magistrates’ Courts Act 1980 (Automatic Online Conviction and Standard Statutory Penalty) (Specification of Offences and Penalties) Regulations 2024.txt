(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations specify the offences which may be dealt with by use of the automatic online conviction process set out in sections 16G to 16M of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1980. This process uses an automatic procedure and allows a guilty plea in a summary only conviction (where there is no custodial option), to be dealt with online without the need for attendance at court. It is intended to simplify the process for suitable cases. A defendant may decline the offer of an automatic online conviction in which case the proceedings will be dealt with by a single magistrate under the Single Justice Procedure or by an attendance at court. The court retains the power to set aside a conviction if it considers it to be unjust.
Regulations 3, 4 and 5 also set out the levels of fines, compensation and surcharge which are to be applied.

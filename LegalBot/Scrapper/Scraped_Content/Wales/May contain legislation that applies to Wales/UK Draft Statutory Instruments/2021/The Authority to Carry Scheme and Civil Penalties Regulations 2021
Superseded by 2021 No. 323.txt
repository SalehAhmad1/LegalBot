DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force the Authority to Carry Scheme 2021 (“the Scheme”) which replaces the Authority to Carry Scheme 2015. The Scheme requires that a carrier must seek authority to carry persons on inbound or outbound journeys to and from the UK who come within the scope of the Scheme. The Scheme specifies the classes of carriers to which it applies, the passengers and crew in respect of whom authority must be requested and sets out the process for carriers to request authority to carry.
These Regulations make amendments to the Authority to Carry Scheme (Civil Penalties) Regulations 2015.
These Regulations revoke the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 (Authority to Carry Scheme) Regulations 2015. Transitional arrangements provide for the service of penalty notices for breaches of the Authority to Carry Scheme 2015.
The Secretary of State will arrange for this Scheme to be published at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/authority-to-carry-scheme-2021.
The Scheme can be requested in hard copy from the Home Office by contacting predeparturechecks@homeoffice.gov.uk.

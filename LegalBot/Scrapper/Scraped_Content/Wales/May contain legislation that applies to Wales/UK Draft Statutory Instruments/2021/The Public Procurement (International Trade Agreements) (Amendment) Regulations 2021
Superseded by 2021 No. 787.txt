DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to various United Kingdom and Scottish public procurement regulations for the purpose of implementing various international trade agreements to which the United Kingdom is a signatory.
The amendments made by these Regulations are “steady state amendments”, as that term is defined in the Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1319) and the Public Procurement etc. (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.S.I. 2020/468) (“the EU Exit SIs”). As such, in accordance with the transitional provisions in the EU Exit SIs, these amendments do not affect any procedure (as that term is defined in the Schedules to the EU Exit SIs) launched before but not yet finalised by IP completion day.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes provision consequential on the Environmental Authorisations (Scotland) Regulations 2018 (SSI 2018/219) (“the 2018 Regulations”). The 2018 Regulations introduced a single integrated framework for environmental authorisations in Scotland in relation to radioactive substances, and repealed in Scotland the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”).
Article 2 of this Order modifies section 7 of the Continental Shelf Act 1964 to substitute references to the 1993 Act with references to the 2018 Regulations. Article 3 of this Order modifies article 4 of the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987 to substitute references to the Radioactive Substances Act 1960 (which was repealed by the 1993 Act) with references to the 2018 Regulations. The effect of these modifications is to deem installations in the offshore area to be part of Scotland for the purposes of the 2018 Regulations as they apply in relation to radioactive substances activity, as was the case previously for the purposes of the 1993 Act.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

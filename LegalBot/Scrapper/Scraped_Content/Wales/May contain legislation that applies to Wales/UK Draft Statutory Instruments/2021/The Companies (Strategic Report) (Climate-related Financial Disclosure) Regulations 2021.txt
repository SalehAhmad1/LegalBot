DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations require certain companies to provide climate-related financial disclosures in their strategic report. The requirement applies to a traded company, a banking company, an authorised insurance company and a company carrying on insurance business which in each case satisfy various conditions, including that of having more than 500 employees. The companies are listed in section 414CA(1) of the Companies Act 2006 and the requirement for more than 500 employees is set out in section 414CA(4) as applied by section 414CA(1B). In addition, these Regulations require two further types of company, with more than 500 employees, to make climate-related financial disclosures. These are a company which has securities admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market and a high turnover company which is a company which does not fall within another category but which has a turnover of more than £500 million (see regulation 3).
Regulation 4 inserts section 414CB(2A) into the Companies Act 2006 which defines climate-related financial disclosures.
Regulation 5 provides for a review of the Regulations before 6th April 2027 with subsequent reviews at intervals not exceeding five years.

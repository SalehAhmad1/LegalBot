DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of food composition and labelling.
Part 2 amends the following instruments: the Food Information Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1855), the Country of Origin of Certain Meats (England) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/518), the Honey (England) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1348), the Caseins and Caseinates (England) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/848). In particular, the amendments to these instruments insert transitional provisions under which authorised officers must not serve improvement notices in relation to certain failures or contraventions for products placed on the market within the period of 21 months beginning with the day on which IP completion day falls.
Part 3 contains operability amendments to certain retained direct EU legislation, in particular in relation to food information and country of origin information and labelling in relation to fresh, chilled and frozen meat of swine, sheep, goats and poultry and in relation to wine. This Part also contains certain amendments about technical matters in relation to wine production.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

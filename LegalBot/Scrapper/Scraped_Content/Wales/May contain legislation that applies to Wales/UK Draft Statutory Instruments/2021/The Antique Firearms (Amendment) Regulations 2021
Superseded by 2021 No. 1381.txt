DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Antique Firearms Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/215) (“the 2021 Regulations”). Section 58(2) of the Firearms Act 1968 (c. 27) (“the 1968 Act”) provides that antique firearms are exempt from certain provisions of that Act if they are sold, transferred, purchased, acquired or possessed as a curiosity or ornament. Section 58(2A) of the 1968 Act provides that a firearm is an antique firearm for the purposes of section 58(2) if it meets a number of conditions. The 2021 Regulations make specifications as to those conditions which are set out in section 58(2B), (2C) and (2D) of the 1968 Act.
These Regulations amend the Schedule to the 2021 Regulations which, together with regulation 2 of the 2021 Regulations, provides a description of those cartridges for which the firearm’s chamber or (as the case may be) each of the firearm’s chambers is designed for use for the purposes of the condition in section 58(2B) of the 1968 Act.
Regulation 2(2) to (4) makes some minor corrections to existing entries in the Schedule to the 2021 Regulations.
Regulation 2(5) omits the specific entries in paragraph 5 of the Schedule for 8 bore, 4 bore, 3 bore, 2 bore, 1 1/8 bore, 1 1/4 bore and 1 1/2 bore, which are standard bore sizes for barrels, and inserts a reference to “bores greater than 10”. The term “bore” refers to the internal diameter of the barrel of a gun, and the bore size is based on the size of the spherical lead ball that fits the bore. The number is a reference to the number of those lead balls that would make up one pound in weight; accordingly, the lower the number, the larger the physical size of the barrel bore, and so the term “bores greater than 10” would be used in the firearms industry to mean any bore capable of accepting lead balls of a size equivalent to fewer than 10 per pound in weight. Accordingly, this term will include the standard bore sizes above, along with any other non-standard or custom bores which would accept a lead ball of a size equivalent to less than 10 per pound in weight. These amendments ensure that vintage rifles, punt guns and shot guns chambered for a bore greater than 10 will fall within the definition of an antique firearm. This corrects an omission from the 2021 Regulations.
As these Regulations correct the 2021 Regulations, the free issue procedure has been applied.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument because there is no, or no significant, impact on business. A full impact assessment of the effect of the 2021 Regulations on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector was prepared and the firearms to which regulation 2(5) applies were included in that assessment. That impact assessment is available from www.gov.uk. Hard copies can be obtained by writing to the Serious Violence Unit, Home Office, 2 Marsham Street, SW1P 4DF.

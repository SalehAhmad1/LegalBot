The following legislation is revoked—
(a)
Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual plan for the stocks of cod, herring and sprat in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks;
(b)
Regulation (EU) 2019/473 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Fisheries Control Agency;
(c)
Regulation (EU) 2019/1022 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a multiannual plan for the fisheries exploiting demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean Sea.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (d) and (g)) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to retained direct EU legislation in the field of the common fisheries policy of the European Union.
These Regulations also make minor amendments to a previous EU exit statutory instrument in the field of animal health and welfare (see regulation 11 which amends the Animals (Legislative Functions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/588)). One amendment removes an erroneous provision in that instrument which has been identified as being in conflict with a similar amendment in a different EU exit instrument. The other removes a regulation-making power which is no longer considered necessary.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

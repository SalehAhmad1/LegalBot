(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(b) and (d)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations amend transitional provisions contained in the Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products and Common Agricultural Policy (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/828) to take account of subsequent amendments to the definition of “exit day” in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, and make minor amendments to correct errors in those Regulations. Those Regulations amend retained direct EU legislation in the field of agricultural market measures, and make consequential amendments to domestic secondary legislation.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

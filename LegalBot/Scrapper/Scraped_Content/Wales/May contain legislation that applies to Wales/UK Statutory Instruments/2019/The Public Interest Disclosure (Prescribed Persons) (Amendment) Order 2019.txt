11th October 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Schedule to the Public Interest Disclosure (Prescribed Persons) Order 2014.
The Employment Rights Act 1996 (the “1996 Act”) provides protection for workers who suffer a detriment or are dismissed as a result of blowing the whistle by making a qualifying disclosure within the meaning of section 43B of the 1996 Act in accordance with any of sections 43C to 43H of that Act. Section 43F of the 1996 Act provides that a qualifying disclosure will be protected if it is made to a prescribed person and relates to matters in respect of which that person is prescribed. The Schedule to the 2014 Order lists the prescribed persons and the matters in respect of which they are prescribed for the purposes of section 43F.
This Order amends the Schedule to the 2014 Order to amend the description of some matters for which certain persons are prescribed, and in particular to substitute Social Care and Social Work Improvement Scotland for the Care Inspectorate, to include the Commission for Equalities and Human Rights, to substitute the Regulator of Social Housing for the Homes and Communities Agency, and to change the name of the Independent Police Complaints Commission to the Independent Office for Police Conduct in the list of prescribed persons.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

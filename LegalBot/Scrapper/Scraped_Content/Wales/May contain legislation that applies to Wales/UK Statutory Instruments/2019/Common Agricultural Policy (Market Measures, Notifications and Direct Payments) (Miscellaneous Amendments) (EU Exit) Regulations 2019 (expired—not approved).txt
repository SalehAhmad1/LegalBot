Part 2 of these Regulations makes amendments to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/891 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/892 concerning producer groups, producer organisations and notifications in the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors.
It also amends provisions of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1185 relating to notifications of agricultural market information to domestic authorities.
Part 3 amends the way that provisions of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 which have been repealed but which continue to operate by virtue of savings provisions in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/891 are to be interpreted.
Part 4 amends the Agriculture (Legislative Functions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/748) to ensure that any reimbursements made in respect of financial adjustments to direct payments for 2018 are paid to farmers on the same basis as previously under the common agricultural policy.

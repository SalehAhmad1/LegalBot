30th October 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The National Health Service (General Dental Services Contracts) Regulations 2005 (“the GDS Regulations”) set out a framework for England for general dental services contracts. The National Health Service (Personal Dental Services Agreements) Regulations 2005 (“the PDS Regulations”) set out a framework for England for personal dental services agreements.
Regulation 24C of the GDS Regulations, in respect of a GDS contract, and regulation 20C of the PDS Regulations, in respect of a PDS agreement, require the terms of the contract or agreement to be varied in a case where the contractor and the National Health Service Commissioning Board (known as NHS England) elect to enter into a prototype agreement. A prototype agreement is an agreement made in accordance with the National Health Service (Dental Services) (Prototype Agreements) Directions 2015 as amended, and the GDS and PDS Regulations, which set out the framework for piloting alternative remuneration arrangements for contractors providing primary dental services.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 24C of the GDS Regulations to extend the date of termination of the prototype agreement to 31st March 2022, to allow further testing of that prototype agreement.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 20C of the PDS Regulations to extend the date of termination of the prototype agreement to 31st March 2022, to allow further testing of that prototype agreement.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

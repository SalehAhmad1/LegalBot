(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 6 of the Transport Act 1985 provides that no local bus service may be operated unless the operator of the service has registered the prescribed particulars of that service with a traffic commissioner.
These Regulations set out the requirements relating to, and procedures to be followed by, local transport authorities, bus operators and a traffic commissioner, where an enhanced partnership scheme is in place.
Regulation 3 sets out the information which is to be included in the notice that a local transport authority or authorities must give to a traffic commissioner when an enhanced partnership plan or scheme is made or varied. This includes details relating to the area of the scheme, the services being operated and any requirements to which the services are subject.
Regulation 4 sets out the information which is to be included in the notice that a local authority or authorities must give a traffic commissioner as to whether or not an enhanced partnership scheme being made or varied specifies a route requirement. This includes details relating to the operator and the service, as well as any requirements to which the service may be subject and details of the specific route requirement.
Regulation 5 requires the local transport authority to notify operators of any delegation to it of the relevant registration functions relating to services being operated wholly within the area to which the scheme relates.
Regulation 6 sets out the information a local transport authority, to which the relevant registration functions for an enhanced partnership scheme have been delegated, must include in a statement the local transport authority must publish at least once a fortnight in respect of the registered, varied or cancelled services.
Regulation 7 requires the local transport authority, to which the relevant registration functions for an enhanced partnership scheme have been delegated, to keep a record of the prescribed particulars of all services, variations and cancellations.
Regulation 8 sets out the process for cancelling the registration of a service where an operational requirement of the enhanced partnership plan or scheme is not being complied with and the relevant registration functions have not been delegated. A traffic commissioner must send to the operator of the service and the relevant local authority or authorities a notice of intention to cancel. In response, the operator can send a notice of compliance to a traffic commissioner. A traffic commissioner must send to the operator, and also publish, a notification of its decision on whether or not to cancel to the service. If the decision is not appealed, the service will be cancelled. If the decision is appealed, the cancellation is postponed until the appeal is heard. A traffic commissioner may also postpone or revoke a cancellation on a request by the relevant local transport authority.
Regulation 9 sets out the process for cancelling the registration of a service where an operational requirement is not being complied with and the relevant registration functions have been delegated to a local transport authority. The local transport authority must send to the operator of the service and every other relevant local transport authority a notice of intention to cancel. In response, the operator can send a notice of compliance to the local transport authority. The local transport authority must send to the operator, and also publish, a notification of its decision on whether or not to cancel the service. If the decision is not appealed, the service will be cancelled. If the decision is appealed, the cancellation is postponed until the appeal is heard. The local transport authority may also postpone or revoke a cancellation.
Regulation 10 sets out the process for cancelling the registration of a service where a route requirement is not being complied with and the relevant registration functions have not been delegated. A traffic commissioner must send to all the operators of services subject to the route requirement, and the relevant local authority or authorities, a notice of intention to cancel. In response, an operator can send a notice of compliance to a traffic commissioner. The local transport authority may notify a traffic commissioner and the operators of their preferred date of cancellation. A traffic commissioner must send to the local transport authority and the operators, and also publish, a notification of its decision on whether to cancel the service. If the decision is not appealed, the service will be cancelled. If the decision is appealed, the cancellation is postponed until the appeal is heard. A traffic commissioner may also postpone or revoke a cancellation on a request by the relevant local transport authority.
Regulation 11 sets out the process for cancelling the registration of a service where a route requirement is not being complied with and the relevant registration functions have been delegated. The local transport authority must send to all the operators of services subject to the route requirement and the relevant local authority or authorities a notice of intention to cancel. In response, an operator can send a notice of compliance to the local transport authority. The local transport authority must notify the operators of, and publish, its decision on whether to cancel the service. If the decision is not appealed, the service will be cancelled. If the decision is appealed, the cancellation is postponed until the appeal is heard. The local transport authority may also postpone or revoke a cancellation.
Regulation 12 sets out the process to be followed where, following a cancellation due to a route requirement not being complied with, an application has been made to register or vary a service which would itself be subject to the route requirement. A traffic commissioner or local transport authority must refuse to register the application if it has been made by the operator that received the notice of cancellation. A traffic commissioner or local transport authority must revoke the cancellation if the application has not been made by the operator that received the notice of cancellation and send a new notice of intention to cancel to the original recipients, as well as the applicant.
Regulation 13 prevents the registration, or variation of registration, of a service where a route requirement has effect and a traffic commissioner considers that the service would be unlikely to be able to comply with the requirement unless the reason is solely that the registration or variation would exceed the number of vehicles allowed on the route by the requirement.
Regulations 14 to 17 set out the process to be followed in tendering for services to replace those cancelled as a result of a failure to meet a route requirement. Regulation 14 requires a local transport authority to issue an invitation for tenders for the award of a slot allocation contract. This regulation also sets out the relevant evaluation criteria for the procurement of such contracts. Regulations 15 and 16 set out the circumstances in which a slot allocation contact is excluded from the requirement of a competitive procurement. Regulation 17 sets out the information which is to be included in the notice that a local transport authority must give to a traffic commissioner when it issues an invitation for tenders for a slot allocation contract. This includes details about the decision to cancel the service, the requirements which must be implemented and the dates of the tender and expiry of the slot allocation contract.
Regulation 18 requires co-operation between a traffic commissioner and a local transport authority for the area of an enhanced partnership scheme in a case where they are both exercising relevant registration functions. In this case traffic commissioners and local transport authorities are also obliged to provide each other with information within a prescribed time limit.
Regulation 19 provides for the extension of the time periods within which certain notifications must be provided.
Regulation 20 amends the Public Service Vehicles (Registration of Local Services) Regulations 1986 to provide for where relevant registration functions have been delegated to a local transport authority. This includes determining the amount of the fee that a local transport authority can charge under section 6H of the Transport Act 1985.
Regulation 21 requires the Secretary of State to carry out a review of these Regulations.

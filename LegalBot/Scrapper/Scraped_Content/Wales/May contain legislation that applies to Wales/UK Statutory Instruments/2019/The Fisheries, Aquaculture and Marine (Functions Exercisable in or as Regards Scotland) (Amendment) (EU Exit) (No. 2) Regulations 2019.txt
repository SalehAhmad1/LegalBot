23rd September 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (in particular under section 8(2)(g)) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations revoke and replace the Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine (Functions Exercisable in or as Regards Scotland) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/728) (“the original Regulations”). These Regulations make the same amendments to Orders made under the Scotland Act 1998 in relation to sea fisheries, aquaculture and marine management as the original Regulations.
These Regulations are being made to ensure there is no doubt in relation to compliance with the requirements of paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which requires certain statutory instruments to be considered by Parliamentary committees in draft form for a recommendation as to the appropriate Parliamentary procedure. The original Regulations are being revoked before they were due to come into force.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

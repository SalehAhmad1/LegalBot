3rd September 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 1) Order 2019, the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 2) Order 2019 and the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 3) Order 2019 enable the movement of cross-Channel lorries in Kent to be controlled by regulating access to the road network, conferring new powers on traffic officers to allow for such vehicles to be detected and directed, and making ancillary provision relating to enforcement.
This Order regulates the use of the local road network in Kent – i.e. those roads maintained by traffic authorities except for the motorway network (the No. 3 Order regulates the use of the M20 Motorway, the primary route to the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone and the Port of Dover).
In particular, heavy commercial vehicles that are leaving the United Kingdom via the Channel Tunnel or the Port of Dover are not permitted to use local roads in Kent (article 3). This restriction does not apply to vehicles—
(a)
already on a local road or nearby premises when the restriction is activated;
(b)
being used on an approved route between the motorway network and Manston Airfield;
(c)
being used on an approved route between Manston Airfield and the Port of Dover while displaying a permit (issued to demonstrate compliance with the traffic management scheme known as Operation Brock);
(d)
if the driver is acting at the direction, or with the permission, of officials or in compliance with a traffic sign;
(e)
making local collections or deliveries of goods;
(f)
during incidental and necessary tasks, such as refuelling the vehicle; or
(g)
operated by local hauliers.
Where the use of local roads is permitted, cross-Channel lorries must remain in the nearside (left-hand) lane of specified dual carriageways so the other lane is reserved for other traffic (article 4).
These restrictions will apply at the same time as a restriction on the use of the M20 Motorway imposed by article 2 of the No. 3 Order and cannot have effect after 31st December 2020.
A full Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it is not expected to have significant impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors. An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared for this Order and is available alongside this instrument on the UK Legislation website www.legislation.gov.uk.

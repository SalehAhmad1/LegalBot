EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16), in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a) or (b)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 3 revokes Regulation (EU) No. 1381/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme for the period 2014 to 2020 (Text with EEA relevance). That Regulation establishes an EU programme on rights, equality and citizenship for the period 2014 to 2020, which aims to protect and promote specific rights and freedoms under EU law.
Regulation 4 sets out transitional provisions that will allow the Secretary of State to give financial assistance if the European Commission does not fund United Kingdom projects in accordance with the Regulation from exit day up until 31 December 2020. The transitional provisions in regulation 4(4) also allow funding to be provided in certain circumstances when the United Kingdom will become a third country participant.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Ministry of Justice, 102 Petty France, London, SW1H 9AJ and is published alongside this instrument at www.legislation.gov.uk.

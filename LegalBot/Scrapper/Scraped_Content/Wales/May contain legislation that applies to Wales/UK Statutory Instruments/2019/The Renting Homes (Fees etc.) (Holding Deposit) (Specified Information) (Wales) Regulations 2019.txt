Minister for Housing and Local Government, one of the Welsh MinistersEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations set out information which must be provided to a prospective contract-holder by either the landlord or their letting agent, before a holding deposit is paid in respect of a standard occupation contract. These Regulations also specify the way in which the information must be provided.
Regulation 2 revokes the Renting Homes (Fees etc.) (Specified Information) (Wales) Regulations 2019.
If the information in regulation 3(2) is not provided to a prospective contract-holder before a holding deposit is paid, the landlord or letting agent may not rely upon the exceptions set out in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 of Schedule 2 to the Renting Homes (Fees etc.) (Wales) Act 2019 and the holding deposit must be repaid. Regulation 3(3) sets out how the information must be provided.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

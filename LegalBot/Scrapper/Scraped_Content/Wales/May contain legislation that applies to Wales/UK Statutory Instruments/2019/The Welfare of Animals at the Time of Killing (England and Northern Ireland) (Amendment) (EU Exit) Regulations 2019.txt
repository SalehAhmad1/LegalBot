At 9.00 a.m. on 7th October 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular in section 8(2)(c) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
They make provision supplementary to that made by regulation 4(8)(b) of the Animal Welfare (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/802) in relation to certificates of competence needed in order to kill animals or carry out related operations in a slaughterhouse. Regulation 4(8)(b) of those Regulations omits the requirement in Article 21(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1099/2009 on the protection of animals at the time of killing to recognize certificates of competence issued in any member State.
Regulation 2 amends the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 (S.R. 2014 No.107) to ensure that, consistently with the arrangements under the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland, after exit day an individual wishing to apply for a certificate of competence may rely on approved training and examination undertaken in the Republic of Ireland.
Regulation 3 makes the same amendment to the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (England) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1782).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

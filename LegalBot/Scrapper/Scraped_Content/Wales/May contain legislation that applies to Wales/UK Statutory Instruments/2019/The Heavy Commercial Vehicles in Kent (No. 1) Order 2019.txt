(This note is not part of the Order)
The Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 1) Order 2019, the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 2) Order 2019 and the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 3) Order 2019 enable the movement of cross-Channel lorries in Kent to be controlled by regulating access to the road network, conferring new powers on traffic officers to allow for such vehicles to be detected and directed, and making ancillary provision relating to enforcement.
This Order empowers traffic officers to—
(a)
require the driver of a heavy commercial vehicle in Kent to produce documents relating to the vehicle's journey (to establish its destination) and documents relating to goods that are being exported (to ascertain the vehicle's readiness to cross the border);
(b)
direct the driver of such a vehicle not to proceed to the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone or the Port of Dover except via a specified road or route in Kent;
(c)
direct the driver of such a vehicle to proceed to a specified motorway in Kent (removing it from the local road network) (article 2).
These powers are exercisable until 31st December 2020.
This Order also creates an offence of failing to comply with a traffic officer exercising the powers described immediately above (article 2(6)) and sets the financial penalty deposit amount for that offence and for breaching the new restrictions (created by the No. 2 and No. 3 Orders) on using cross-Channel lorries on roads in Kent (article 3).
A full Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it is not expected to have significant impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors.

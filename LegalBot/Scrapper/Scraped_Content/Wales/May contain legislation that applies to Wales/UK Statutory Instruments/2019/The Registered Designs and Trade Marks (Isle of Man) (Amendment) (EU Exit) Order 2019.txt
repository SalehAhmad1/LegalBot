“SCHEDULE 1A
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY REGISTERED DESIGNS
PART 1
Existing registered Community designs
Designs registered as Community designs to be treated as registered under the Act
1.—(1) A design which, immediately before exit day, is entered in the RCD register and has been published in the Community Designs Bulletin as mentioned in Article 73(1) (an “existing registered Community design”) is to be treated on and after exit day as if an application for its registration had been made, and it had been registered, under this Act.
(2) A registered design which comes into being by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is referred to in this Schedule as a “re-registered design”.
(3) This Act applies to a re-registered design as it applies to other registered designs except as otherwise provided in this Schedule.
(4) For the purposes of this Act—
(a)
the date of registration of a re-registered design is the date on which the existing registered Community design from which the re-registered design derives was treated as registered under the Community Design Regulation, and
(b)
the date of the application of a re-registered design is the date treated, under Article 38, as the date of filing of the application for the registration of the existing registered Community design from which the re-registered design derives.
(5) Any fee provided for by regulations under Schedule 4 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in respect of any matter relating to a re-registered design applies in the Isle of Man in respect of that matter.
(6) The following provisions of this Act do not apply to a re-registered design—
(a)
section 7A(6);
(b)
section 18.
(7) In this Schedule—
(a)
“the RCD register” means the register of registered Community designs maintained under Article 72;
(b)
“the Community Design Regulation” means Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12th December 2001 on Community Designs as it had effect immediately before exit day.
Entries to be made in the register in relation to designs treated as registered under this Act
2.—(1) The registrar must as soon as reasonably practicable on or after exit day enter a re-registered design in the register of designs.
(2) The obligation under section 22(1) (inspection of registered designs) applies to a reregistered design on and after the day on which the re-registered design is entered in the register (notwithstanding that no certificate of registration has been granted).
Opt out
3.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), the proprietor of an existing registered Community design may at any time on or after exit day serve a notice on the registrar that the design is not to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act.
(2) A notice under sub-paragraph (1) may not be served where on or after exit day—
(a)
the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design (or any interest in it)—
(i)
has been assigned or otherwise transferred except by an assent by personal representatives, or
(ii)
has had an interest created in it by a mortgage, licence or other instrument; or
(b)
proceedings based on the re-registered design have been initiated by the proprietor or with the proprietor’s consent.
(3) A notice served under sub-paragraph (1) must—
(a)
identify the existing registered Community design; and
(b)
include the name and address of any person having an interest in the existing registered Community design which had effect before exit day in the United Kingdom and in respect of which an entry was recorded in the RCD register.
(4) A notice under sub-paragraph (1) is of no effect unless the proprietor in that notice certifies that any such person—
(a)
has been given not less than three months’ notice of the proprietor’s intention to serve such a notice; or
(b)
is not affected by, or if affected consents to, the notice.
(5) Where a notice has been served under sub-paragraph (1)—
(a)
the design ceases with effect from exit day to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act,
(b)
the obligation imposed on the registrar under paragraph 2 (entries to be made in the register in relation to designs treated as registered under this Act) ceases to have effect, and
(c)
the registrar must make any necessary amendments to the register.
Effect of claim of priority
4.—(1) This paragraph applies where a right of priority has been claimed in accordance with Article 42 in respect of an existing registered Community design.
(2) The proprietor of the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design is to be treated on and after exit day as having the same claim of priority.
(3) Accordingly, the relevant date for the purposes of establishing whether (or to what extent) the re-registered design is new or has individual character is the date of filing of the application for registration of a design in a convention country which formed the basis for the claim of priority.
Unregistered pre-exit transfers
5.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day there is a transfer of an existing registered Community design that has not been entered in the RCD register (a “relevant transfer”).
(2) Section 19 (registration of assignments, etc.) applies in relation to a relevant transfer as if it were an assignment of the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design which has been transferred.
Pre-exit licences to continue to have effect in the United Kingdom
6.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an existing registered Community design is the subject of a licence which—
(a)
authorises the doing of acts in the United Kingdom which would otherwise infringe an existing registered Community design, and
(b)
does not expire on exit day (a “relevant licence”).
(2) Subject to any agreement to the contrary between the licensee and the licensor, a relevant licence continues to authorise the doing of acts which would otherwise infringe the right in the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design.
(3) Sub-paragraph (2) is subject to the terms on which the relevant licence was granted, subject to such modifications as are necessary for their application in the United Kingdom.
(4) Section 19 (registration of assignments, etc.) applies in relation to a relevant licence as if it were a licence of the re-registered design deriving from the existing registered Community design which is subject to the relevant licence, subject to the following modification.
(5) Where immediately before exit day there is an entry in the RCD register relating to the relevant licence, section 19(5) does not apply to the licence until after the expiry of the period of 12 months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Security interests in existing registered Community designs
7.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an existing registered Community design is the subject of an interest which has been granted as security and does not expire on exit day (a “relevant security interest”).
(2) References to the existing registered Community design in any document which grants or refers to the relevant security interest are to be read as including references to the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design.
(3) Section 19 (registration of assignments, etc.) applies in relation to a relevant security interest as if it were a security interest granted in respect of the re-registered design deriving from the existing registered Community design which is subject to the relevant security interest, subject to the following modification.
(4) Where immediately before exit day there is an entry in the RCD register relating to the relevant security interest, section 19(5) does not apply to the document granting the interest until after the expiry of the period of 12 months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Continuity of rights in relation to an existing registered Community design
8.—(1) References to an existing registered Community design or the registration of an existing registered Community design in any document entered into before exit day shall, unless there is evidence that the document was not intended to have effect in the United Kingdom, be read on and after exit day as including references to the re-registered design or the registration of the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design.
(2) Subject to any agreement to the contrary, a consent granted before exit day by the proprietor of an existing registered Community design to the doing on or after exit day of an act in the United Kingdom which would otherwise infringe the right in the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design is to be treated for the purposes of section 7A as a consent to the doing of that act granted by the registered proprietor of the re-registered design.
Pending proceedings concerning an existing registered Community design
9.—(1) This paragraph applies where on exit day an existing registered Community design is the subject of proceedings which are pending (“pending proceedings”) before a court in the United Kingdom designated for the purposes of Article 80 (“a Community design court”).
(2) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), the provisions contained or referred to in Title IX of the Community Design Regulation (with the exception of Articles 86(2), (4), (5) and 91) shall continue to apply to the pending proceedings as if the United Kingdom were still a Member State with effect from exit day.
(3) Where the pending proceedings involve a claim for infringement or for threatened infringement of an existing registered Community design, without prejudice to any other relief by way of damages, accounts or otherwise available to the proprietor of the existing registered Community design, the Community design court may grant an injunction to prohibit unauthorised use of the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design.
(4) Where the pending proceedings involve a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity in relation to an existing registered Community design, the Community design court may declare the registration of the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design to be invalid (wholly or in part).
(5) Where the registration of a re-registered design is declared invalid to any extent, the registration shall to that extent be treated as having been invalid from the date of registration or from such other date as the court may direct.
(6) For the purposes of this paragraph proceedings are treated as pending on exit day if they were instituted but not finally determined before exit day.
Effect of injunction protecting an existing registered Community design
10.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an injunction is in force prohibiting the performance of acts in the United Kingdom which infringe or would infringe an existing registered Community design (a “relevant injunction”).
(2) Subject to any order of the court to the contrary, a relevant injunction will have effect and be enforceable to prohibit the performance of acts which infringe or would infringe the right in a re-registered design to the same extent as in relation to the existing registered Community design from which the re-registered design derives as if it were an injunction granted by the court.
PART 2
Applications for registered Community designs which are pending at exit day
Applications for registration pending immediately before exit day
11.—(1) In this Part references to an existing EU application are to an application for registration of a design under the Community Design Regulation in respect of which the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) are satisfied.
(2) The conditions referred to in sub-paragraph (1) are that immediately before exit day—
(a)
the application has been accorded a filing date pursuant to Article 38; and
(b)
the application has been neither granted nor refused by the European Union Intellectual Property Office.
12.—(1) Where a person who has filed an existing EU application or a successor in title of that person applies for registration of the same design under this Act within a period beginning with exit day and ending with the end of the relevant period, the relevant date for the purposes of establishing whether (or to what extent) the design which is the subject of the application under this Act is new or has individual character is the earliest of—
(a)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 38 to the existing EU application;
(b)
the date of priority (if any) claimed under Article 42 in respect of the existing EU application.
(2) In sub-paragraph (1), the “relevant period” means the period of nine months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
(3) For the purposes of this Act—
(a)
where an application is made of the type referred to in sub-paragraph (1) within the period referred to in that sub-paragraph, the date of the application is the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 38 to the existing EU application, and
(b)
where the registrar registers a design which is the subject of an application of the type referred to in sub-paragraph (1) which is made within the period referred to in that sub-paragraph, the date of registration of the design is the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 38 to the existing EU application.
(4) Accordingly section 3C does not apply in relation to the design.
PART 3
Registered Community designs where publication is deferred at exit day
Designs registered at the EUIPO immediately before exit day where publication is deferred
13.—(1) In this Part references to a deferred design are to a design registered under the Community Design Regulation in respect of which the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) are satisfied.
(2) The conditions referred to in sub-paragraph (1) are that immediately before exit day—
(a)
the design is entered in the RCD register, and
(b)
publication of the design is deferred under Article 50.
14.—(1) This paragraph applies where the proprietor of a deferred design or a successor in title of that person applies for registration of the same design under this Act within a period beginning with exit day and ending with the end of the relevant period.
(2) Sections 3A(4) and 3B do not apply in relation to the application.
(3) The relevant date for the purposes of establishing whether (or to what extent) the design which is the same as the deferred design is new or has individual character is the earliest of—
(a)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 38 to the application for the deferred design;
(b)
the date of priority (if any) claimed under Article 42 in respect of the application for the deferred design.
(4) If the registrar registers a design which is the subject of an application of the type referred to in sub-paragraph (1) which is made within the period referred to in that sub-paragraph, the date of registration of the design is the date on which the deferred design which is the same as that design was treated as registered under the Community Design Regulation.
(5) Accordingly section 3C does not apply in relation to the design.
(6) In sub-paragraph (1), the “relevant period” means, the period of nine months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
PART 4
Treatment of registered Community designs whose registrations expire during the period of six months ending on exit day
Application of Part
15.—(1) This Part applies to a design in respect of which the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) are satisfied (an “expired Community design”).
(2) The conditions referred to in sub-paragraph (1) are that—
(a)
immediately before the transitional period, the design was the subject of a registration under the Community Design Regulation,
(b)
the registration of the design expired during the transitional period (such that the design did not fall within paragraph 1(1)), and
(c)
the registration of the design would have been capable of being renewed under Article 13 for at least one further period of five years had a request for renewal been made under Article 13 prior to that expiry.
(3) An expired Community design is to be treated as if it were an existing registered Community design.
(4) The provisions of Part 1 of this Schedule apply to an expired Community design as they apply to an existing Community design subject to the provisions of this Part of the Schedule.
(5) Notwithstanding the entry in the register of designs (under paragraph 2, as applied by sub-paragraph (4)) of a re-registered design which derives from an expired Community design, the right in the re-registered design is expired until the period for which it subsists is extended in accordance with paragraph 16 (or the re-registered design is removed from the register in accordance with paragraph 16(3)).
(6) In this paragraph, “transitional period” means the period of six months ending with exit day.
Renewal of registration of an expired Community design
16.—(1) Where the registration of an expired Community design is renewed in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Continuing Community Design Regulation the registrar must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of such renewal, record in the register of designs the extension of the period for which subsists the right in the reregistered design which derives from the expired Community design.
(2) Where the period for which the right in a re-registered design subsists is extended under sub-paragraph (1), the right is to be treated as if it had never expired, with the result that—
(a)
anything done under or in relation to the right in the period beginning with exit day and ending with the extension under sub-paragraph (1) is to be treated as valid,
(b)
an act which would have constituted an infringement of the right if it had not expired is to be treated as an infringement, and
(c)
an act which would have constituted use of the design for the services of the Crown if the right had not expired is to be treated as such use.
(3) If the registration of an expired Community design is not renewed within the time period permitted by Article 13(3) of the Continuing Community Design Regulation—
(a)
the registrar must remove from the register of designs the re-registered design which derives from the expired Community design; and
(b)
the re-registered design ceases with effect from exit day to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act.
(4) In this Schedule “the Continuing Community Design Regulation” means the Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12th December 2001 on Community Designs as it has effect in EU law.

(b)
on or after exit day the registration of the said design is restored pursuant to Article 67 of the Continuing Community Design Regulation.
(2) Where the proprietor of the design files a request with the registrar within the period of six months beginning with the date of such restoration—
(a)
the design will be treated as if it were an existing registered Community design on exit day;
(b)
the provisions of Part 1 apply to the re-registered design which derives from the existing registered Community design.
Restoration of application for registered Community design

(a)
before exit day an application for a registered Community design is refused pursuant to the Community Design Regulation; and
(b)
on or after exit day the application is restored pursuant to Article 67 of the Continuing Community Design Regulation (a “relevant application”).
(2) Where a person who has filed a relevant application or a successor in title of that person applies for registration of the same design under this Act within a period beginning with exit day and ending with the end of the relevant period, the relevant date for the purposes of establishing whether the design which is the subject of the application under this Act is new or has individual character is the earliest of—
(a)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 38 to the relevant application;
(b)
the date of priority (if any) claimed under Article 42 in respect of the relevant application.

Existing international designs
International designs in respect of which the European Union is designated to be treated as registered under the Act
1.—(1) A design which, immediately before exit day, meets the requirements of subparagraph (2) (a “protected international registered design (EU))” is to be treated on and after exit day as if an application for its registration had been made, and it had been registered, under this Act.
(2) The requirements referred to in sub-paragraph (1) are—
(a)
the design is the subject of an international registration which designates the European Union;
(b)
the international registration has been published by the International Bureau pursuant to Article 10(3) of the Geneva Act;
(c)
the European Union Intellectual Property Office has sent to the International Bureau a statement under Rule 18bis of the Common Regulations under the 1999 Act and the 1960 Act of the Hague Agreement to the effect that protection is granted in relation to the design, or the period under Article 106e(1) of the Community Design Regulation for communicating to the International Bureau a notification of refusal in respect of the international registration has expired; and
(d)
the effects of the international registration so far as they relate to the design have neither been—
(i)
refused by the European Union Intellectual Property Office pursuant to Article 106e(1) of the Community Design Regulation; nor
(ii)
declared wholly invalid pursuant to Article 106f of the Community Design Regulation.
(3) Where prior to exit day the effects of the international registration to which a protected international registered design (EU) is subject are declared partly invalid so far as relating to that design pursuant to Article 106f of the Community Design Regulation, the re-registered international design which derives from the protected international registered design (EU) has effect under this Act to the extent that the effects of the international registration so far as relating to the design have not been declared invalid.
(4) A registered design which comes into being by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is referred to in this Schedule as a “re-registered international design”.
(5) This Act applies to a re-registered international design as it applies to other registered designs except as otherwise provided in this Schedule.
(6) For the purposes of this Act—
(a)
the date of registration of a re-registered international design is the date on which the protected international registered design (EU) from which the re-registered international design derives was treated as registered under the Geneva Act, and
(b)
the date of the application of a re-registered international design is the date treated, under Article 9 of the Geneva Act, as the filing date of the application for the registration of the protected international registered design (EU) from which the re-registered international design derives.
(7) Any fee provided for by regulations under Schedule 4 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in respect of any matter relating to a re-registered international design applies in the Isle of Man in respect of that matter.
(8) The following provisions of this Act do not apply to a re-registered international design—
(a)
section 7A(6);
(b)
section 18.
(9) In this Schedule—
(a)
“the Community Design Regulation” means Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12th December 2001 on Community Designs as it had effect immediately before exit day;
(b)
“the Geneva Act” means the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs adopted by the Diplomatic Conference on 2 July 1999;
(c)
“the International Bureau” means the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization; and
(d)
“international registration” means the international registration of an industrial design effected according to the Geneva Act.
Entries to be made in the register in relation to designs treated as registered under this Act
2.—(1) The registrar must as soon as reasonably practicable on or after exit day enter a re-registered international design in the register of designs.
(2) The obligation under section 22(1) (inspection of registered designs) applies to a reregistered international design on and after the day on which the re-registered international design is entered in the register (notwithstanding that no certificate of registration has been granted).
Opt out
3.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), the holder of the international registration to which a protected international registered design (EU) is subject (“the proprietor”) may at any time on or after exit day serve a notice on the registrar that the design is not to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act.
(2) A notice under sub-paragraph (1) may not be served where on or after exit day—
(a)
the re-registered international design which derives from the protected international registered design (EU) (or any interest in it)—
(i)
has been assigned or otherwise transferred except by an assent by personal representatives, or
(ii)
has had an interest created in it by a mortgage, licence or other instrument; or
(b)
proceedings based on the re-registered international design have been initiated by the proprietor or with the proprietor’s consent.
(3) A notice served under sub-paragraph (1) must:
(a)
identify the protected international registered design (EU); and
(b)
include the name and address of any person who, to the best of the proprietor’s knowledge, has an interest in the protected international registered design (EU).
(4) A notice under sub-paragraph (1) is of no effect unless the proprietor in that notice certifies that any such person—
(a)
has been given not less than three months’ notice of the proprietor’s intention to serve such a notice; or
(b)
is not affected by, or if affected consents to, the notice.
(5) Where a notice has been served under sub-paragraph (1)—
(a)
the design ceases with effect from exit day to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act,
(b)
the obligation imposed on the registrar under paragraph 2 (entries to be made in the register in relation to designs treated as registered under this Act) ceases to have effect, and
(c)
the registrar must make any necessary amendments to the register.
Effect of claim of priority
4.—(1) This paragraph applies where a right of priority has been claimed in accordance with Article 6 of the Geneva Act in respect of the international registration to which a protected international registered design (EU) is subject.
(2) The proprietor of the re-registered international design which derives from the protected international registered design (EU) is to be treated on and after exit day as having the same claim of priority.
(3) Accordingly, the relevant date for the purposes of establishing whether (or to what extent) the re-registered international design is new or has individual character is the date of filing of the application for registration of a design in a convention country or a member of the World Trade Organization which formed the basis for the claim of priority.
Unregistered pre-exit transfers

(b)
the change in ownership has effect in respect of the European Union and the protected international registered design (EU), and
(c)
the change in ownership has not been entered in the international register (a “relevant transfer”).
(2) Section 19 (registration of assignments, etc.) applies in relation to a relevant transfer as if it were an assignment of the re-registered international design which derives from the protected international registered design (EU) which has been transferred.
Pre-exit licences to continue to have effect in the United Kingdom
6.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day a protected international registered design (EU) is the subject of a licence which—
(a)
authorises the doing of acts in the United Kingdom which would otherwise infringe the protected international registered design (EU), and
(b)
does not expire on exit day (a “relevant licence”).
(2) Subject to any agreement to the contrary between the licensee and the licensor, a relevant licence continues to authorise the doing of acts which would otherwise infringe the re-registered international design which derives from the protected international registered design (EU).
(3) Sub-paragraph (2) is subject to the terms on which the relevant licence was granted, subject to such modifications as are necessary for their application in the United Kingdom.
(4) Section 19 (registration of assignments, etc.) applies in relation to a relevant licence as if it were a licence of the re-registered international design deriving from the protected international registered design (EU) which is subject to the relevant licence, subject to the following modification.
(5) Section 19(5) does not apply to the licence until after the expiry of the period of 12 months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Security interests in protected international registered designs (EU)
7.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day a protected international registered design (EU) is the subject of an interest which has been granted as security and does not expire on exit day (a “relevant security interest”).
(2) References to the protected international registered design (EU), or the international registration to which the protected international registered design (EU) is subject, in any document which grants or refers to the relevant security interest are to be read as including references to the re-registered international design which derives from the protected international registered design (EU).
(3) Section 19 (registration of assignments, etc.) applies in relation to a relevant security interest as if it were a security interest granted in respect of the re-registered design deriving from the protected international registered design (EU) which is subject to the relevant security interest, subject to the following modification.

(2) Subject to any agreement to the contrary, a consent granted before exit day by the holder of the international registration to which a protected international registered design (EU) is subject to the doing on or after exit day of an act in the United Kingdom which would otherwise infringe the re-registered international design which derives from the protected international registered design (EU) is to be treated for the purposes of section 7A as a consent to the doing of that act granted by the registered proprietor of the re-registered international design.
Pending proceedings concerning a protected international registered design (EU)
9.—(1) This paragraph applies where on exit day a protected international registered design (EU) is the subject of proceedings which are pending (“pending proceedings”) before a court in the United Kingdom designated for the purposes of Article 80 (“a Community design court”).
(2) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), the provisions contained or referred to in Title IX of the Community Design Regulation (with the exceptions of Articles 86(2), (4), (5) and 91) shall continue to apply to the pending proceedings as if the United Kingdom were still a Member State with effect from exit day.
(3) Where the pending proceedings involve a claim for infringement or for threatened infringement of a protected international registered design (EU), without prejudice to any other relief by way of damages, accounts or otherwise available to the holder of the international registration to which the protected international registered design (EU) is subject, the Community design court may grant an injunction to prohibit unauthorised use of the re-registered international design which derives from the protected international registered design (EU).
(4) Where the pending proceedings involve a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity in relation to a protected international registered design (EU), the Community design court may declare the registration of the re-registered international design which derives from the protected international registered design (EU) to be invalid (wholly or in part).
(5) Where the registration of a re-registered international design is declared invalid to any extent, the registration shall to that extent be treated as having been invalid from the date of registration or from such other date as the court may direct.
(6) For the purposes of this paragraph proceedings are treated as pending on exit day if they were instituted but not finally determined before exit day.
Effect of injunction protecting a protected international registered design (EU)
10.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an injunction is in force prohibiting the performance of acts in the United Kingdom which infringe or would infringe a protected international registered design (EU) (a “relevant injunction”).
(2) Subject to any order of the court to the contrary, a relevant injunction will have effect and be enforceable to prohibit the performance of acts which infringe or would infringe the right in a re-registered international design to the same extent as in relation to the protected international registered design (EU) from which the re-registered international design derives as if it were an injunction granted by the court.
PART 2
International registrations in respect of which the period for refusal has not expired before exit day etc.
11.—(1) In this Part references to a “pending international design (EU)” are to a design which, immediately before exit day, meets the requirements of sub-paragraph (2).
(2) The requirements referred to in sub-paragraph (1) are—
(a)
the design is the subject of an international registration which designates the European Union;
(b)
the design is not the subject of—
(i)
a refusal by the European Union Intellectual Property Office pursuant to Article 106e(1) of the Community Design Regulation; or
(ii)
a statement by the European Union Intellectual Property Office under Rule 18bis of the Common Regulations under the 1999 Act and the 1960 Act of the Hague Agreement to the effect that protection is granted in relation to it;
(c)
the international registration to which the design is subject—
(i)
has not been published by the International Bureau pursuant to Article 10(3) of the Geneva Act; or
(ii)
has been published by the International Bureau but the period under Article 106e(1) of the Community Design Regulation for communicating to the International Bureau a notification of refusal in respect of the international registration has not expired.
12.—(1) Where the holder of the international registration to which a pending international design (EU) is subject, or a successor in title of that person, makes an application for registration of the same design under this Act within a period beginning with exit day and ending with the end of the relevant period, the relevant date for the purposes of establishing whether (or to what extent) the design which is the subject of the application under this Act is new or has individual character is the earliest of—
(a)
the date on which the international registration was treated as registered pursuant to Article 10(2) of the Geneva Act;
(b)
the date of priority (if any) claimed under Article 41 of the Community Design Regulation as applied by Article 106a of that Regulation in respect of the pending international design (EU).
(2) In sub-paragraph (1), the “relevant period” means the period of nine months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
(3) For the purposes of this Act—
(a)
where an application is made of the type referred to in sub-paragraph (1) within the period referred to in that sub-paragraph, the date of the application is the date on which the international registration to which the pending international design (EU) is subject was treated as registered pursuant to Article 10(2) of the Geneva Act, and
(b)
where the registrar registers a design which is the subject of an application of the type referred to in sub-paragraph (1) which is made within the period referred to in that sub-paragraph, the date of registration of the design is the date on which the international registration to which the pending international design (EU) is subject was treated as registered pursuant to Article 10(2) of the Geneva Act.
(4) Accordingly section 3C does not apply in relation to the design.
PART 3
Treatment of international registered designs whose registrations expire during the period of six months ending on exit day
Application of Part
13.—(1) This Part applies to a design which met the requirements set out in paragraph 1(2)(b) to (d) in respect of which the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) are satisfied (an “expired international design”).
(2) The conditions referred to in sub-paragraph (1) are that—
(a)
immediately before the transitional period, the design was the subject of an international registration which designated the European Union,
(b)
the international registration expired during the transitional period (such that the design did not fall within paragraph 1(1)), and
(c)
the renewal of the international registration would have been capable of being effected for the European Union in accordance with Article 17 of the Geneva Act for at least one further period of five years had a request for renewal been made in accordance with Article 17(2) prior to that expiry.
(3) An expired international design is to be treated as if it were a protected international registered design (EU).
(4) The provisions of Part 1 of this Schedule apply to an expired international design as they apply to a protected international registered design (EU) subject to the provisions of this Part of the Schedule.
(5) Notwithstanding the entry in the register of designs (under paragraph 2, as applied by sub-paragraph (4)) of a re-registered international design which derives from an expired international design, the right in the re-registered international design is expired until it is extended in accordance with paragraph 14 (or the re- registered design is removed from the register in accordance with paragraph 14(3)).
(6) In this paragraph, “transitional period” means the period of six months ending with exit day.
Renewal of registration of an expired international design
14.—(1) Where within the period beginning with exit day and ending with the end of the relevant period—
(a)
the international registration to which an expired international design was subject is renewed in accordance with Article 17(2) of the Geneva Act,
(b)
the renewal has effect in respect of the European Union and the expired international design, and
(c)
the holder of that international registration notifies the registrar of such renewal,
the registrar must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of notification, record in the register of designs the extension of the period for which subsists the right in the re-registered international design which derives from the expired international design.
(2) Where the period for which the right in a re-registered international design subsists is extended under sub-paragraph (1), the right is to be treated as if it had never expired, with the result that—
(a)
anything done under or in relation to the right in the period beginning with exit day and ending with the extension under sub-paragraph (1) is to be treated as valid,
(b)
an act which would have constituted an infringement of the right if it had not expired is to be treated as an infringement, and
(c)
an act which would have constituted use of the design for the services of the Crown if the right had not expired is to be treated as such use.
(3) If within the period referred to in sub-paragraph (1) the holder fails to notify the registrar in accordance with sub-paragraph (1)(c)—
(a)
the registrar must remove from the register of designs the re-registered international design which derives from the expired international design, and
(b)
the re-registered international design ceases with effect from exit day to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act.
(4) In sub-paragraph (1), the “relevant period” means the period of nine months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.

EUROPEAN UNION TRADE MARKS
PART 1
Existing European Union Trade Marks
A trade mark registered as an existing EUTM to be treated as registered under this Act
1.—(1) A trade mark which is registered in the EUTM Register immediately before exit day (an “existing EUTM”) is to be treated on and after exit day as if an application had been made, and the trade mark had been registered, under this Act in respect of the same goods or services as the existing EUTM is registered in the EUTM Register.
(2) A registered trade mark which comes into being by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is referred to in this Act as a comparable trade mark (EU).
(3) This Act applies to a comparable trade mark (EU) as it applies to other registered trade marks except as otherwise provided in this Schedule.
(4) A comparable trade mark (EU) is deemed for the purposes of this Act to be registered as of the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the application which resulted in the registration of the corresponding EUTM and that date is deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the date of registration.
(5) Section 40(3) and (4) does not apply to the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) under this Part.
(6) Section 67(1) applies in relation to the provision of information and the inspection of documents relating to a comparable trade mark (EU) notwithstanding that there will have been no application under this Act for the registration of the trade mark (and so no publication of an application).
(7) Any fee provided for by regulations under Schedule 4 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in respect of any matter relating to a comparable trade mark (EU) in the Isle of Man in respect of that matter.
(8) For the purposes of this Act—
(a)
the date of filing of an application for registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) is the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the application which resulted in the registration of the corresponding EUTM;
(b)
references to the date of application for registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) are to the date of filing of the application;
(c)
where an earlier trade mark is a comparable trade mark (EU), references to the completion of the registration procedure for the earlier trade mark are to the completion of the registration procedure in respect of the corresponding EUTM.
(9) In this Schedule—
(a)
“corresponding EUTM”, in relation to a comparable trade mark (EU), means the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives;
(b)
“the EUTM Register” means the register of European Union trade marks maintained by the European Union Intellectual Property Office.
Opt out
2.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), the proprietor of an existing EUTM may, at any time on or after exit day, serve notice on the registrar that the trade mark is not to be treated as if the trade mark had been registered under this Act (an “opt out notice”).
(2) An opt out notice may not be served where on or after exit day—
(a)
the comparable trade mark (EU) has been put to use in the United Kingdom by the proprietor or with the proprietor’s consent (which use includes affixing the trade mark to goods or to the packaging of goods in the United Kingdom solely for export purposes);
(b)
the comparable trade mark (EU) (or any right in or under it) has been made the subject of an assignment, licence, security interest or any other agreement or document except for an assent by personal representatives in relation to the comparable trade mark (EU); or
(c)
proceedings based on the comparable trade mark (EU) have been initiated by the proprietor or with the proprietor’s consent.
(3) An opt out notice must—
(a)
identify the existing EUTM; and
(b)
include the name and address of any person having an interest in the existing EUTM which had effect before exit day in the United Kingdom, and in respect of which an entry was recorded in the EUTM Register.
(4) An opt out notice is of no effect unless the proprietor in that notice certifies that any such person—
(a)
has been given not less than three months’ notice of the proprietor’s intention to serve an opt out notice; or
(b)
is not affected or if affected, consents to the opt out.
(5) Where a notice has been served in accordance with this paragraph—
(a)
the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM ceases with effect from exit day to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act; and
(b)
the registrar must, where particulars of the comparable trade mark (EU) have been entered in the register, remove the comparable trade mark (EU) from the register.
Entries to be made in the register in relation to a comparable trade mark (EU)
3.—(1) The registrar must as soon as reasonably practicable after exit day enter a comparable trade mark (EU) in the register.
(2) The particulars of the goods or services in respect of which the comparable trade mark (EU) is treated as if it had been registered must be taken from the English language version of the entry for the corresponding EUTM in the EUTM Register.
(3) Where—
(a)
the application for registration of the corresponding EUTM was not filed in English; or
(b)
the second language indicated by the applicant pursuant to Article 146(3) was a language other than English,
a person having a sufficient interest who considers that the English language version is inaccurate may apply to the registrar for rectification of the register by the substitution of an English translation of the relevant authentic text (as determined in accordance with Article 147(3)) verified to the satisfaction of the registrar as corresponding to the authentic text.
Comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from an EU Collective Mark or EU Certification Mark
4.—(1) This paragraph applies where the European Union trade mark from which a comparable trade mark (EU) derives is an EU collective mark or an EU certification mark.
(2) The comparable trade mark (EU) is to be treated as either a collective mark or a certification mark, as the case may be.
(3) The proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU) must, following notice from the registrar, file with the registrar regulations governing the use of the European Union trade mark, submitted pursuant to the European Union Trade Mark Regulation, which had effect immediately before exit day.
(4) Where the regulations referred to in sub-paragraph (3) are in a language other than English they must be filed together with a translation into English verified to the satisfaction of the registrar as corresponding to the original text.
(5) Paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 apply in relation to the translation referred to in sub-paragraph (4) as they apply in relation to the regulations referred to in sub-paragraph (3).
(6) Where the regulations or any translation are not filed in accordance with the above provisions—
(a)
the registrar must remove the comparable trade mark (EU) from the register; and
(b)
the rights of the proprietor shall be deemed to have ceased as from the date of removal.
Renewal of a comparable trade mark (EU) which expires within six months after exit day
5.—(1) This paragraph applies to the renewal of the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) which expires within the period beginning with exit day and ending with the end of the relevant period (and accordingly section 43(1) to (3A) does not apply).
(2) The registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) may be renewed at the request of the proprietor before the expiry of the registration.
(3) Where the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) is not renewed in accordance with sub-paragraph (2)—
(a)
on, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the expiry of the registration, the registrar must notify the proprietor that the registration has expired and of the manner in which the registration may be renewed; and
(b)
a request for renewal must be made within the period of six months beginning with the date of the notice.
(4) If a request for renewal is made in respect of only some of the goods or services for which the comparable trade mark (EU) is registered, the registration is to be renewed for those goods or services only.
(5) If the registration is not renewed in accordance with the above provisions, the registrar must remove the comparable trade mark (EU) from the register.
(6) Section 43(4) and (6) applies to the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) which is renewed in accordance with the above provisions.
(7) In paragraph (1), the “relevant period” means the period of six months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Restoration of a comparable trade mark (EU)

(a)
the proprietor of an existing EUTM has claimed a right of priority in accordance with Article 35; and
(b)
immediately before exit day there is an entry in the EUTM Register containing particulars of that claim of priority (a “claim of priority”).
(2) The proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM is to be treated on and after exit day as having the same claim of priority.
(3) Accordingly, the relevant date for the purposes of establishing, in relation to the comparable trade mark (EU), which rights take precedence is the date of filing of the application for a trade mark in a Convention country which formed the basis for the claim of priority.

13.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an existing EUTM has a valid claim to seniority of a trade mark which trade mark (the “senior mark”) is a registered trade mark or a protected international trade mark (UK).
(2) The comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM is to be treated on and after exit day as if it had a valid claim to seniority of the senior mark.

(4) An existing EUTM has a valid claim to seniority of a trade mark where—
(a)
a claim has been filed in accordance with Article 39 or 40; and

the seniority claimed for the existing EUTM has not lapsed in the circumstances referred to in Article 39.
Determination of invalidity and liability to revocation in relation to claims of seniority

(a)
removed from the register under section 43; or
(b)
surrendered under section 45,
any person may apply to the registrar or to the court for the declaration set out in subparagraph (2).
(2) The declaration is that if the trade mark had not been so removed or surrendered, the registration of the trade mark would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47.
(3) Where the declaration is that had the trade mark not been so removed or surrendered the registration of it would have been liable to be—
(a)
revoked under section 46 with effect from a date prior to—
(i)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the application which resulted in the registration of the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives where there has been no claim of priority; or
(ii)
the priority date (if any) accorded pursuant to a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 in respect of the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives where there has been a claim of priority; or
(b)
declared invalid under section 47,
the seniority claimed for the comparable trade mark (EU) is to be treated as if it never had effect.
(4) Where pursuant to paragraph 13 a comparable trade mark (EU) is treated as if it had a valid claim to seniority of a protected international trade mark (UK) which has been—
(a)
removed from the register of trade marks maintained by the International Bureau for the purposes of the Madrid Protocol; or
(b)
surrendered under the Madrid Protocol,
any person may apply to the registrar or to the court for the declaration set out in subparagraph (5).
(5) The declaration is that, if the trade mark had not been so removed or surrendered, the protection of the mark in the United Kingdom would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47.
(6) Where the declaration is that had the trade mark not been so removed or surrendered the protection of the mark in the United Kingdom would have been liable to be—
(a)
revoked under section 46 with effect from a date prior to—
(i)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the application which resulted in the registration of the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives where there has been no claim of priority; or
(ii)
the priority date (if any) accorded pursuant to a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 in respect of the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives where there has been a claim of priority; or
(b)
declared invalid under section 47,
the seniority claimed for the comparable trade mark (EU) is to be treated as if it never had effect.
(7) References in sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) to sections 46 and 47 are to those sections as they apply to a protected international trade mark (UK) under an order made pursuant to section 54.
(8) Where a trade mark has been surrendered or allowed to lapse in respect of some only of the goods or services for which it is registered, the declaration in sub-paragraphs (2) and (5) is that if the goods or services had not been removed from the registration, the registration of the trade mark would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47 and subparagraphs (3) and (6) shall be construed accordingly.

(b)
the proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU).

(a)
section 25(3) and (4) does not apply until after the expiry of the relevant period; and
(b)
section 25(4)(a) applies after the expiry of the relevant period but as if the reference to six months beginning with the date of the transaction were a reference to eighteen months beginning with exit day.
(7) In paragraph (6)(a), the “relevant period” means the period of twelve months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Effect of a security interest in an existing EUTM
18.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an existing EUTM (or any right in or under it) is the subject of a security interest (a “relevant security interest”) which does not terminate on exit day.
(2) References to the existing EUTM in any document which grants or refers to the relevant security interest are to be read as including references to the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM.

(4) An application under section 25(1) may only be made by—
(a)
a person claiming to be entitled to an interest in or under a comparable trade mark (EU) by virtue of the relevant security interest; or

(2) Subject to any agreement to the contrary, a consent granted before exit day by the proprietor of an existing EUTM to the doing on or after exit day of an act in the United Kingdom which would otherwise infringe the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM is to be treated for the purposes of section 9 as a consent to the doing of that act.
Existing EUTM: pending proceedings

(3) Where the pending proceedings involve a claim for infringement of an existing EUTM, without prejudice to any other relief by way of damages, accounts or otherwise available to the proprietor of the existing EUTM, the EU trade mark court may grant an injunction to prohibit unauthorised use of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM.

(5) Where the grounds for revocation or invalidity exist in respect of only some of the goods or services for which the existing EUTM is registered, the revocation or declaration of invalidity in respect of the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM relates to those goods or services only.
(6) Where (by virtue of sub-paragraph (4)) the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) is revoked to any extent, the rights of the proprietor are deemed to have ceased to that extent as from—
(a)
the date of the counterclaim for revocation, or
(b)
if the court is satisfied that the grounds for revocation existed at an earlier date, that date.
(7) Where (by virtue of sub-paragraph (4)) the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) is declared invalid to any extent, the registration is to that extent to be deemed never to have been made, provided that this does not affect transactions past and closed.
(8) For the purposes of this paragraph proceedings are treated as pending on exit day if they were instituted but not finally determined before exit day.
Existing EUTM: effect of injunction
21.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an injunction is in force prohibiting the performance of acts in the United Kingdom which infringe or would infringe an existing EUTM (a “relevant injunction”).
(2) Subject to any order of the court to the contrary, a relevant injunction will have effect and be enforceable to prohibit the performance of acts which infringe or would infringe a comparable trade mark (EU) to the same extent as in relation to the European Union trade mark from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives as if it were an injunction granted by the court.

(2) An expired EUTM is to be treated as if it were an existing EUTM.
(3) The provisions of Part 1 of this Schedule apply to an expired EUTM as they apply to an existing EUTM subject to the provisions of this Part of the Schedule.
(4) Notwithstanding the entry in the register (under paragraph 3, as applied by subparagraph (3)) of a comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from an expired EUTM, the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) is expired until it is renewed in accordance with paragraph 23 (or the comparable trade mark (EU) is removed from the register in accordance with paragraph 23(4)).
(5) In this paragraph, “transitional period” means the period of six months ending with exit day.
Renewal of an expired EUTM
23.—(1) Where the registration of an expired EUTM is renewed in accordance with Article 53 of the Continuing EUTM Regulation the registrar must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of such renewal, renew the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the expired EUTM.
(2) A comparable trade mark (EU) which is renewed under sub-paragraph (1) shall be renewed for a period of ten years from the expiry of the registration of the expired EUTM.

(4) If the registration of an expired EUTM is not renewed within the time period permitted by Article 53 of the Continuing EUTM Regulation—
(a)
the registrar must remove from the register the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the expired EUTM; and
(b)
the comparable trade mark (EU) ceases with effect from exit day to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act.
(5) In this Schedule, the “Continuing EUTM Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the European Union Trade Mark(a) as it has effect in EU law.

Right to claim seniority where seniority has been claimed by an existing EUTM application
26.—(1) Where an existing EUTM application claims seniority of a trade mark which trade mark (“the senior mark”) is a registered trade mark or a protected international trade mark (UK), the applicant may claim seniority of the senior mark in an application for registration of a trade mark (“a relevant mark”) pursuant to this Part.
(2) The effect of a seniority claim made pursuant to sub-paragraph (1) is that where following the registration of the relevant mark the proprietor of that mark surrenders the senior mark or allows it to lapse (wholly or partially), subject to paragraph 27, the proprietor of the relevant mark is deemed to continue to have the same rights as the proprietor would have had if the senior mark had continued to be registered in respect of all the goods or services for which it was registered prior to the surrender or lapse.
(3) Provision may be made by rules as to the manner of claiming seniority pursuant to this paragraph.
Determination of invalidity and liability to revocation in relation to claim of seniority under paragraph 26

(b)
surrendered under the Madrid Protocol,
any person may apply to the registrar or to the court for the declaration set out in subparagraph (5).

Section 54A
SCHEDULE 2B
INTERNATIONAL TRADE MARKS PROTECTED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION
PART 1
Existing international trade marks protected in the European Union
An international trade mark protected in the European Union to be treated as registered under this Act
1.—(1) A trade mark which, immediately before exit day, is an international trade mark which is protected in the European Union in accordance with Article 189(2) of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation (an “existing IR(EU)”) is to be treated on and after exit day as if an application had been made, and the trade mark had been registered, under this Act in respect of the same goods or services in respect of which the international trade mark is protected in the European Union.
(2) Where the international registration to which an international trade mark is subject is sub-divided to reflect the making of more than one request for territorial extension to the European Union under Article 3ter there is to be deemed for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) to be a separate trade mark in respect of the goods or services covered by each subdivision of the registration.
(3) Where the international registration to which an international trade mark is subject has been created by virtue of Rule 27(2) (recording of partial change in ownership) (a “separate international registration”), it is irrelevant for the purposes of the application of subparagraph (2) to that separate international registration that the requests for territorial extension were made before the separate international registration was created.
(4) A registered trade mark which comes into being by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is referred to in this Act as a comparable trade mark (IR).
(5) This Act applies to a comparable trade mark (IR) as it applies to other registered trade marks except as otherwise provided in this Schedule.
(6) A comparable trade mark (IR) is deemed for the purposes of this Act to be registered as of—
(a)
where the protection in the European Union of the existing IR(EU) from which the comparable trade mark (IR) derives resulted from a request for territorial extension under Article 3ter(1) (request mentioned in original application), the date of registration of the existing IR(EU) accorded pursuant to Article 3(4); or
(b)
where the protection in the European Union of the existing IR(EU) from which the comparable trade mark (IR) derives resulted from a request for territorial extension under Article 3ter(2) (subsequent request), the date on which the request was recorded in the International Register,
and that date is deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the date of registration.
(7) Section 40(3) and (4) does not apply to the registration of a comparable trade mark (IR) under this Part.
(8) Section 67(1) applies in relation to the provision of information and the inspection of documents relating to a comparable trade mark (IR) notwithstanding that there will have been no application under this Act for the registration of the trade mark (and so no publication of an application).
(9) Any fee provided for by regulations under Schedule 4 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in respect of any matter relating to a comparable trade mark (IR) applies in the Isle of Man in respect of that matter.
(10) For the purposes of this Act—
(a)
the date of filing of an application for registration of a comparable trade mark (IR) is the same date as the deemed date of registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) under sub-paragraph (6);
(b)

the proviso in subsection (3) were omitted.
Effect of disclaimer
12.  Where, immediately before exit day, the protection in the European Union of an existing IR(EU) is subject to a disclaimer recorded in the International Register, the registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the existing IR(EU) is to be treated on and after exit day as subject to the same disclaimer (and section 13 applies accordingly but as if the reference to “publication” in subsection (2) was omitted).

Effect of seniority claim

(2) The comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the existing IR(EU) is to be treated on and after exit day as if it had a valid claim to seniority of the senior mark.
(3) Accordingly, where the proprietor of the comparable trade mark (IR) surrenders the senior mark or allows it to lapse (whether wholly or partially), subject to paragraph 15, the proprietor of the comparable trade mark (IR) is deemed to continue to have the same rights as the proprietor would have had if the senior mark had continued to be registered in respect of all the goods or services for which it was registered prior to the surrender or lapse.
(4) An existing IR(EU) has a valid claim to seniority of a trade mark where—

a claim has been filed in accordance with Article 191 or 192 of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation in respect of the international registration to which the existing IR(EU) is subject; and
(b)
the seniority so claimed has not lapsed in the circumstances referred to in Article 39 of that Regulation (as it applies to international registrations under Article 182 of that Regulation).
Determination of invalidity and liability to revocation in relation to claims of seniority

(a)
removed from the register under section 43; or

surrendered under section 45,
any person may apply to the registrar or to the court for the declaration set out in subparagraph (2).
(2) The declaration is that if the trade mark had not been so removed or surrendered, the registration of the trade mark would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47.
(3) Where the declaration is that had the trade mark not been so removed or surrendered the registration of it would have been liable to be—
(a)
revoked under section 46 with effect from a date prior to—
(i)
where there has been no claim of priority pursuant to Article 35 of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation (as it applies to international registrations under Article 182 of that Regulation) in respect of the existing IR(EU) from which the comparable trade mark (IR) derives, the deemed date of registration of the comparable trade mark (IR); or
(ii)
where there has been a claim of priority, the priority date accorded pursuant to a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation in respect of the existing IR(EU) from which the comparable trade mark (IR) derives; or
(b)
declared invalid under section 47,
the seniority claimed for the comparable trade mark (IR) is to be treated as if it never had effect.
(4) Where pursuant to paragraph 14 a comparable trade mark (IR) is treated as if it had a valid claim to seniority of a protected international trade mark (UK) which has been—
(a)
removed from the International Register; or
(b)
surrendered under the Madrid Protocol,
any person may apply to the registrar or to the court for the declaration set out in subparagraph (5).
(5) The declaration is that, if the trade mark had not been so removed or surrendered, the protection of the mark in the United Kingdom would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47.
(6) Where the declaration is that had the trade mark not been so removed or surrendered the protection of the mark in the United Kingdom would have been liable to be—
(a)
revoked under section 46 with effect from a date prior to—
(i)
where there has been no claim of priority pursuant to Article 35 of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation (as it applies to international registrations under Article 182 of that Regulation) in respect of the existing IR(EU) from which the comparable trade mark (IR) derives, the deemed date of registration of the comparable trade mark (IR); or
(ii)
where there has been a claim of priority, the priority date accorded pursuant to a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation in respect of the existing IR(EU) from which the comparable trade mark (IR) derives; or
(b)
declared invalid under section 47,
the seniority claimed for the comparable trade mark (IR) is to be treated as if it never had effect.
(7) Where the protection in the European Union of an existing IR(EU) resulted from a request for territorial extension under Article 3ter(2), a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation in respect of the existing IR(EU) is to be disregarded for the purposes of sub-paragraphs (3)(a)(ii) and (6)(a)(ii) unless the request for territorial extension was recorded in the International Register within a period of six months beginning with the day after the priority date recorded in the International Register in respect of the international application for protection of the trade mark which is the same as the one in respect of which the request for territorial extension was filed.
(8) References in sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) to sections 46 and 47 are to those sections as they apply to a protected international trade mark (UK) under an order made pursuant to section 54.
(9) Where a trade mark has been surrendered or allowed to lapse in respect of some only of the goods or services for which it is registered, the declaration in sub-paragraphs (2) and (5) is that if the goods or services had not been removed from the registration, the registration of the trade mark would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47 and subparagraphs (3) and (6) shall be construed accordingly.

(a)
section 25(3) and (4) does not apply until after the expiry of the relevant period; and
(b)
section 25(4)(a) applies after the expiry of the relevant period but as if the reference to six months beginning with the date of the transaction were a reference to eighteen months beginning with exit day.
(7) In sub-paragraph (6)(a), the “relevant period” means the period of twelve months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Effect of a security interest in an existing IR(EU)
19.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an existing IR(EU) (or any right in or under it) is the subject of a security interest (a “relevant security interest”) which—
(a)
restricts the proprietor’s right to dispose in the European Union of the existing IR(EU); and
(b)
does not terminate on exit day.
(2) References to the existing IR(EU), or the international registration to which the existing IR(EU) is subject, in any document which grants or refers to the relevant security interest are to be read as including references to the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the existing IR(EU).

(2) Subject to any agreement to the contrary, a consent granted before exit day by the proprietor of an existing IR(EU) to the doing on or after exit day of an act in the United Kingdom which would otherwise infringe the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the existing IR(EU) is to be treated for the purposes of section 9 as a consent to the doing of that act.
Existing IR(EU): pending proceedings
21.—(1) This paragraph applies where on exit day an existing IR(EU) is the subject of proceedings which are pending (“pending proceedings”) before a court in the United Kingdom designated for the purposes of Article 123 of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation (“EU trade mark court”).

(3) Where the pending proceedings involve a claim for infringement of an existing IR(EU), without prejudice to any other relief by way of damages, accounts or otherwise available to the proprietor of the existing IR(EU), the EU trade mark court may grant an injunction to prohibit unauthorised use of the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the existing IR(EU).
(4) Where the pending proceedings involve a counterclaim for the revocation of, or a declaration of invalidity in relation to, an existing IR(EU), the EU trade mark court may revoke the registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the existing IR(EU) or declare the registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the existing IR(EU) to be invalid.

(6) Where (by virtue of sub-paragraph (4)) the registration of a comparable trade mark (IR) is revoked to any extent, the rights of the proprietor are deemed to have ceased to that extent as from—
(a)
the date of the counterclaim for revocation, or
(b)
if the court is satisfied that the grounds for revocation existed at an earlier date, that date.
(7) Where (by virtue of sub-paragraph (4)) the registration of a comparable trade mark (IR) is declared invalid to any extent, the registration is to that extent to be deemed never to have been made, provided that this does not affect transactions past and closed.

(2) Subject to any order of the court to the contrary, a relevant injunction will have effect and be enforceable to prohibit the performance of acts which infringe or would infringe a comparable trade mark (IR) to the same extent as in relation to the existing IR(EU) from which the comparable trade mark (IR) derives as if it were an injunction granted by the court.
PART 2
Treatment of international trade marks protected in the European Union which expire during the period of six months ending on exit day
Registration of certain expired international trade marks
23.—(1) This Part applies to an international trade mark which, immediately before the transitional period, was protected in the European Union in accordance with Article 189(2) of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation but which, as a result of the expiry of the registration of the international trade mark during the transitional period, does not fall within paragraph 1(1) (an “expired IR(EU)”).
(2) Where the international registration to which an international trade mark is subject has been sub-divided as referred to in paragraph 1(2), there is to be deemed for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) to be a separate expired trade mark in respect of the goods or services covered by each sub-division of the registration.
(3) An expired IR(EU) is to be treated as if it were an existing IR(EU).
(4) The provisions of Part 1 of this Schedule apply to an expired IR(EU) as they apply to an existing IR(EU) subject to the provisions of this Part of the Schedule.
(5) Notwithstanding the entry in the register (under paragraph 3, as applied by subparagraph (4)) of a comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from an expired IR(EU), the registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) is expired until the proprietor gives notice to the registrar in accordance with paragraph 24(1)(b) (or the comparable trade mark (IR) is removed from the register in accordance with paragraph 24(2)).
(6) In this paragraph, “transitional period” means the period of six months ending with exit day.
Renewal of an expired IR(EU)
24.—(1) Where within the period beginning with exit day and ending with the end of the relevant period—
(a)
the international registration to which an expired IR(EU) is subject is renewed in accordance with Article 7; and
(b)
the proprietor of the expired IR(EU) notifies the registrar of such renewal (a “renewal notice”),
paragraphs 25 and 26 apply to the renewal of the registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the expired IR(EU).
(2) If within the period referred to in sub-paragraph (1) the proprietor fails to notify the registrar in accordance with sub-paragraph (1)(b)—
(a)
the registrar must remove from the register the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the expired IR(EU); and
(b)
the comparable trade mark (IR) ceases with effect from exit day to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act.
(3) In sub-paragraph (1), the “relevant period” means the period of nine months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Renewal of an expired IR(EU): territorial extension under Article 3ter(1)
25.—(1) Where the protection in the European Union of an expired IR(EU) resulted from a request for territorial extension under Article 3ter(1), the registrar must, as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of the renewal notice, renew the registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the expired IR(EU).
(2) A comparable trade mark (IR) which is renewed under sub-paragraph (1) shall be renewed for a period of ten years from the expiry of the international registration to which the expired IR(EU) is subject.
(3) Section 43(6) applies to the registration of a comparable trade mark (IR) which is renewed in accordance with this paragraph.
Renewal of an expired IR(EU): territorial extension under Article 3ter(2)
26.—(1) This paragraph applies where the protection in the European Union of an expired IR(EU) resulted from a request for territorial extension under Article 3ter(2).
(2) The relevant date for the purposes of determining the date of renewal of the registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the expired IR(EU) (the “relevant renewal date”) shall be—
(a)
the date of expiry of the period of ten years from the date on which the request for territorial extension was recorded in the International Register; or
(b)
where the international registration to which the expired IR(EU) is subject has been renewed since the date referred to in paragraph (a), the anniversary of that date, computed by reference to periods of ten years, following the last renewal of the registration prior to the date of the renewal notice (the “notice date”).
(3) Where the relevant renewal date of a comparable trade mark (IR) falls prior to the notice date, the registrar must, as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of a renewal notice, renew the registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) which derives from the expired IR(EU).
(4) Where the relevant renewal date of a comparable trade mark (IR) falls before the expiry of the period of six months beginning with the notice date, sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) apply (and accordingly section 43(1) to (3A) does not apply).
(5) The registration of the comparable trade mark (IR) may be renewed at the request of the proprietor before the relevant renewal date.

PART 2
New Articles 14a and 14b
“Article 14a
Transitional provisions: relations between trade marks, designations of origin and geographical indications
1.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where, if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 13(1) in relation to a category A designation of origin or geographical indication.
2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where:
(a)
if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 13(1) in relation to a category B designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(b)
after the application for the trade mark is accepted but before the trade mark is registered:
(i)
in the case of a type 3B designation of origin or geographical indication:
(aa)
the international agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of column 2 of row 3 of the Types Table enters into force, and
(bb)
the entry into force of the international agreement is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered;
(ii)
in the case of any other category B designation of origin or geographical indication:
(aa)
the Secretary of State publishes an Article 52(4) approval notice relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(bb)
the Article 52(4) approval notice is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered.
3.  Where an application for a declaration of invalidity is made under the TMA (as applied by Article 14b(1) and modified by Article 14b(2)) in relation to the registration of a trade mark, the registration of a trade mark must be declared to be invalid, unless paragraph 4 applies, if:
(a)
the application to register the trade mark was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period,
(b)
the use of the trade mark contravenes, or will, if used, contravene, Article 13(1) in relation to a category B designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(c)
in the case of a type 2B, 4B, 5B, 6B or 7B designation of origin or geographical indication, the Secretary of State publishes an Article 52(4) approval notice relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication on or after the day on which the trade mark application is accepted.
4.  This paragraph applies where a column 5 date applies in relation to a category A or B designation of origin or geographical indication and, taking account of any priority claimed in respect of an application to register the trade mark referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3(a) (as relevant) and on the basis of the information available to the registrar, it appears to the registrar that the date of filing of the trade mark application is earlier than the column 5 date that applies to the relevant designation of origin or geographical indication.
5.  As regards paragraph 1 or 2, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 3A, 4A or 5A designation of origin or geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication provides that an application for a trade mark must be refused, regardless of when that application is filed, if the trade mark, if registered, will contravene a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the designation of origin or geographical indication
6.  As regards paragraph 3, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 3B, 4B or 5B designation of origin or geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication provides that the registration of a trade mark must be invalidated if, regardless of when the application that resulted in the registration of the trade mark is filed, the use of the trade mark contravenes a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the designation of origin or geographical indication.
7.  Where a designation of origin or geographical indication falls within the definition of more than one type of designation of origin or geographical indication in Article 3a, the column 5 date to be taken into account for the purpose of paragraph 4 is the earliest of the column 5 dates for the relevant types of designation of origin or geographical indication.
8.  A trade mark that could be used under Article 14(2) of EU Regulation 1151/2012 M1 immediately before exit day and could be renewed pursuant to that provision may continue to be used and renewed:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would contravene Article 13(1) in relation to a designation of origin or geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
9.  Where paragraph 8 applies to the use or renewal of a trade mark, this does not affect the use of:
(a)
a designation of origin or geographical indication entered on the United Kingdom's PDOs and PGIs Register by the Secretary of State under Article 11(2);
(b)
an established protected designation of origin or an established protected geographical indication entered on the United Kingdom's PDOs and PGIs Register pursuant to Article 16;
(c)
a designation of origin or geographical indication entered on the United Kingdom's PDOs and PGIs Register following a decision by the Secretary of State to approve an application to register the designation of origin or geographical indication following an application submitted under Article 49.

(a)

“Article 102a
Transitional provisions: relationship with trade marks
1.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where, if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 103(2) in relation to a category A designation of origin or geographical indication.
2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where:
(a)
if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 103(2) in relation to a category B designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(b)
after the application for the trade mark is accepted but before the trade mark is registered:
(i)
in the case of a type 3B designation of origin or geographical indication:
(aa)
the international agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of column 2 of row 3 of the Types Table enters into force, and
(bb)
the entry into force of the international agreement is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered;
(ii)
in the case of any other category B designation of origin or geographical indication:
(aa)
the Secretary of State publishes an Article 99 approval notice relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(bb)
the Article 99 approval notice is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered.
3.  Where an application for a declaration of invalidity is made under the TMA (as applied by Article 102b(1) and modified by Article 102b(2)) in relation to the registration of a trade mark, the registration of a trade mark must be declared to be invalid, unless paragraph 4 applies, if:
(a)
the application to register the trade mark was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period,
(b)
the use of the trade mark contravenes, or will, if used, contravene, Article 103(2) in relation to a category B designation of origin or geographical indication, and
(c)
in the case of a type 2B, 4B, 5B, 6B or 7B designation of origin or geographical indication, the Secretary of State publishes an Article 99 approval notice relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication on or after the day on which the trade mark application is accepted.
4.  This paragraph applies where a column 5 date applies in relation to a category A or B designation of origin or geographical indication and, taking account of any priority claimed in respect of an application to register a trade mark referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3(a) (as relevant) and on the basis of the information available to the registrar, it appears to the registrar that the date of filing of the trade mark application is earlier than the column 5 date that applies to the relevant designation of origin or geographical indication.
5.  As regards paragraph 1 or 2, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 3A, 4A or 5A designation of origin or geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication provides that an application for a trade mark must be refused, regardless of when that application is filed, if the trade mark, if registered, will contravene a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the designation of origin or geographical indication
6.  As regards paragraph 3, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 3B, 4B or 5B designation of origin or geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the designation of origin or geographical indication provides that the registration of a trade mark must be invalidated if, regardless of when the application that resulted in the registration of the trade mark is filed, the use of the trade mark contravenes a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the designation of origin or geographical indication.
7.  Where a designation of origin or geographical indication falls within the definition of more than one type of designation of origin or geographical indication in Article 93a, the column 5 date to be taken into account for the purpose of paragraph 4 is the earliest of the column 5 dates for the relevant types of designation of origin or geographical indication.
8.  A trade mark that could be used under Article 102(2) of EU Regulation 1308/2013 immediately before exit day and could be renewed pursuant to that provision may continue to be used and renewed:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would contravene Article 103(2) in relation to a designation of origin or geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
9.  Where paragraph 8 applies to the use or renewal of a trade mark, this does not affect the use of:
(a)
a designation of origin or geographical indication entered on the United Kingdom's PDOs and PGIs Register following a decision by the Secretary of State to approve an application made under Article 95(1a) M1 or Article 3 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/34 laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards applications for protection of designations of origin, geographical indications and traditional terms in the wine sector, the objection procedure, amendments to product specifications, the register of protected names, cancellation of protection and use of symbols, and of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards an appropriate system of checks M2;

2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where:

7.  A trade mark that could be used under Article 19(2) of EU Regulation 251/2014 immediately before exit day and could be renewed pursuant to that provision may continue to be used and renewed:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would contravene Article 20(2) in relation to a geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.

(a)
following a decision by the Secretary of State to grant an application to register the geographical indication submitted under Article 11;

“Article 32a
Transitional provision: relationship with trade marks
1.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where, if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will not respect the definition in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the conditions of use in Article 113 of that Regulation in relation to a category A traditional term.
2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where:
(a)
if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will not respect the definition in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and conditions of use in Article 113 of that Regulation in relation to a category B traditional term, and
(b)
after the application for the trade mark is accepted but before the trade mark is registered:
(i)
in the case of a type 2B traditional term:
(aa)
the international agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of column 2 of row 2 of the Types Table enters into force, and
(bb)
the entry into force of the international agreement is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered;
(ii)
in the case of any other category B traditional term:
(aa)
the Secretary of State publishes an Article 115(2) approval notice relating to the traditional term, and
(bb)
the Article 115(2) approval notice is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered.
3.  Where an application for a declaration of invalidity is made under the TMA (as applied by Article 32b(1) and modified by Article 32b(2)) in relation to the registration of a trade mark, the registration of a trade mark must be declared to be invalid, unless paragraph 4 applies, if:
(a)
the application to register the trade mark was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period,
(b)
the use of the trade mark does not, or will not, if used, respect the definition in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and conditions of use in Article 113 of that Regulation in relation to the category B traditional term, and
(c)
in the case of a type 3B, 4B, 5B or 6B traditional term, the Secretary of State publishes an Article 115(2) approval notice relating to the traditional term on or after the day on which the trade mark application is accepted.
4.  This paragraph applies where a column 5 date applies in relation to a category A or B traditional term and, taking account of any priority claimed in respect of an application to register the trade mark referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3(a) (as relevant) and on the basis of the information available to the registrar, it appears to the registrar that the date of filing of the trade mark application is earlier than the column 5 date that applies to the relevant traditional term.
5.  As regards paragraph 1 or 2, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2A, 3A or 4A traditional term where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the traditional term provides that an application for a trade mark must be refused, regardless of when that application is filed, if the trade mark, if registered, will contravene a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the traditional term
6.  As regards paragraph 3, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2B, 3B or 4B traditional term where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the traditional term provides that the registration of a trade mark must be invalidated if, regardless of when the application that resulted in the registration of the trade mark is filed, the use of the trade mark contravenes a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the traditional term.
7.  Where a traditional term falls within the definition of more than one type of traditional term in Article 1b, the column 5 date to be taken into account for the purpose of paragraph 4 is the earliest of the column 5 dates for the relevant types of traditional term.
8.  A trade mark that could be used under Article 32(3) of EU Regulation 2019/33 M1, or renewed pursuant to that provision, in the United Kingdom immediately before exit day may continue to be used and renewed on and after exit day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would not respect the definition in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and conditions of use in Article 113 of that Regulation in relation to a traditional term registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
9.  Where paragraph 8 applies to the use or renewal of a trade mark, this does not affect the use of:
(a)
an established traditional term (within the meaning of Article 39(2)) entered on the United Kingdom's Traditional Terms Register pursuant to Article 39(1);

“Article 36a
Transitional provision: relationship between trade marks and geographical indications
1.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where, if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 21(2) in relation to a category A geographical indication.
2.  Unless paragraph 4 applies, an application to register a trade mark that was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period must be refused where:
(a)
if the trade mark is registered, the use of the trade mark will contravene Article 21(2) in relation to a category B geographical indication, and
(b)
after the application for the trade mark is accepted but before the trade mark is registered:
(i)
in the case of a type 2B geographical indication:
(aa)
the international agreement referred to in paragraph (c) of column 2 of row 2 of the Types Table enters into force, and
(bb)
the entry into force of the international agreement is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered;
(ii)
in the case of any other category B geographical indication:
(aa)
the Secretary of State publishes an Article 30(4) approval notice relating to the geographical indication, and
(bb)
the Article 30(4) approval notice is brought to the attention of the registrar before the trade mark is registered.
3.  Where an application for a declaration of invalidity is made under the TMA (as applied by Article 36b(1) and modified by Article 36b(2)) in relation to the registration of a trade mark, the registration of a trade mark must be declared to be invalid, unless paragraph 4 applies, if:
(a)
the application to register the trade mark was pending immediately before exit day or filed during the relevant period,
(b)
the use of the trade mark contravenes, or will, if used, contravene, Article 21(2) in relation to the category B geographical indication, and
(c)
in the case of a type 3B, 4B, 5B or 6B geographical indication, the Secretary of State publishes an Article 30(4) approval notice relating to the geographical indication on or after the day on which the trade mark application is accepted.
4.  This paragraph applies where a column 5 date applies in relation to the category A or B geographical indication and, taking account of any priority claimed in respect of an application to register the trade mark referred to in paragraph 1, 2 or 3(a) (as relevant) and on the basis of the information available to the registrar, it appears to the registrar that the date of filing of the trade mark application is earlier than the column 5 date that applies to the relevant geographical indication.
5.  As regards paragraph 1 or 2, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2A, 3A or 4A geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the geographical indication provides that an application for a trade mark must be refused, regardless of when that application is filed, if the trade mark, if registered, will contravene a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the geographical indication
6.  As regards paragraph 3, a column 5 date does not apply in relation to a type 2B, 3B or 4B geographical indication where the EUIA referred to in paragraph (b) in column 2 of the row of the Types Table relating to the geographical indication provides that the registration of a trade mark must be invalidated if, regardless of when the application that resulted in the registration of the trade mark is filed, the use of the trade mark contravenes a provision in the EUIA providing for the protection of the use of the geographical indication.
7.  Where a geographical indication falls within the definition of more than one type of geographical indication in Article 4, the column 5 date to be taken into account for the purpose of paragraph 4 is the earliest of the column 5 dates for the relevant types of geographical indication.
8.  A trade mark that could be used in the United Kingdom under Article 36(2) of EU Regulation 2019/787 M1, and could be renewed pursuant to that provision, immediately before exit day may continue to be used and renewed on and after exit day:
(a)
notwithstanding that the use of the trade mark would contravene Article 21(2) in relation to a geographical indication registered by the Secretary of State under this Regulation;
(b)
provided that no grounds for the invalidation or revocation of the trade mark exist in, or under, the TMA.
9.  Where paragraph 8 applies to the use or renewal of a trade mark, this does not affect the use of:
(a)
a geographical indication entered on the United Kingdom's GIs Register by the Secretary of State following a decision by the Secretary of State to approve an application made under Article 24;

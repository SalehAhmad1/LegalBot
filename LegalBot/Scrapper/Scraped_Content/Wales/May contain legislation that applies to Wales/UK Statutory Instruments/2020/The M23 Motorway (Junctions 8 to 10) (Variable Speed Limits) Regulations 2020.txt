(b)
that length of the northbound carriageway of the M23 beginning at junction 10 at the southern edge of the southern bridge of Crawley Interchange and ending at junction 8 at a point 50 metres north of the tip of the nose where the carriageway to the clockwise and anti-clockwise carriageways of the M25 at junction 7 of the M25 diverges from the northbound carriageway of the M23; and
(c)
the roads, or the specified lengths of the roads (as the case may be) referred to in paragraph 4.
2.  Any reference in this Schedule to—

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce variable speed limits to the northbound and southbound carriageways of the M23 motorway between junctions 8 and 10 and to roads which connect with the M23 motorway at those junctions.
Regulation 3 provides for variable speed limits to have effect on the roads specified in paragraph 1 of the Schedule. Where variable speed limit signs are in operation a vehicle may not be driven at a speed above the maximum indicated by each speed limit sign passed by a vehicle until it passes a sign indicating that the national speed limit applies or the vehicle leaves the roads covered by the regulation. Where a speed limit changes less than ten seconds before a vehicle passes the sign and the sign had indicated a higher speed limit, the regulation allows the driver to proceed at a speed up to the maximum applicable before the change. Where the speed limit sign indicates a speed limit when it is passed by a vehicle but less than ten seconds previously it was either giving no indication of a speed limit or that the national speed limit applied, the sign is to be taken as giving no indication of a speed limit to the vehicle passing it.
Contravention of these Regulations is an offence under section 17(4) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations as no impact on the cost of business or the voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

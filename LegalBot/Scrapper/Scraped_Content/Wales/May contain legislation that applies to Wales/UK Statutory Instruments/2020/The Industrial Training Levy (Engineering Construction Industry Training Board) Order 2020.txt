EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING
The Industrial Training Levy (Engineering Construction Industry Training Board) Order 2020
Made
10th September 2020
Coming into force in accordance with article 1
The Secretary of State makes this Order in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 11(2) and 12(3) and (4) of the Industrial Training Act 1982(1) (“the Act”).
This Order is made to give effect to levy proposals submitted by the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board(2) pursuant to section 11(1) of the Act which, as required by section 11(3) of the Act, include proposals for the exemption of employers employing a small number of employees.
The levy proposals include proposals for securing that no exemption certificates shall be issued by the Board and the amount of levy payable by any employer in respect of a levy period will exceed 0.2% of their relevant emoluments in respect of the base period for each levy period. Accordingly, section 11(5) of the Act applies to this Order.
In relation to the requirements set out in section 11(5) of the Act the Secretary of State is satisfied that the levy proposals are necessary to encourage adequate training in the industry and the condition mentioned in section 11(6)(a) of the Act is met.
The Secretary of State estimates that the levy to be paid by employers in the industry exceeds 1% of their relevant emoluments and accordingly this Order falls within section 11(7)(b) of the Act; the Secretary of State considers that the amount to be paid by employers in the industry is appropriate in the circumstances.
The Secretary of State has consulted the Scottish Ministers as required by section 88(2) of the Scotland Act 1998(3).
A draft of this Order was laid before Parliament in accordance with section 12(6) of the Act and approved by resolution of each House of Parliament.

10th September 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order gives effect to levy proposals of the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board (“the Board”) which were submitted to the Secretary of State under section 11 of the Industrial Training Act 1982 (c. 10) (“the Act”).
The levy proposals were for the imposition of a levy on employers engaged wholly or mainly in the engineering construction industry (as defined in article 2(1)) for the purpose of raising money towards meeting the Board’s expenses.
The levy is to be imposed in respect of three levy periods, one in each of 2020, 2021 and 2022 (article 3).
The amount of levy to be assessed for each leviable establishment is calculated in accordance with article 7. This calculation is carried out with reference to the relevant base period (article 4). The total amount of levy payable by an employer is the aggregate amount of levy for all the employer’s leviable establishments (article 8). An employer assessed to levy will receive a written assessment notice from the Board setting out the amount of levy payable by that employer (article 10). Payment of the levy must usually be made within one month of service of the assessment notice by the Board (article 14). An assessment notice may be withdrawn by the Board and the Board may also serve an amended assessment notice (articles 11 and 12).
Article 9 makes provision for employers employing a small number of employees to be exempt from the levy.
An employer assessed to levy may appeal against that assessment. An appeal must normally be made within one month of the date of service of the relevant assessment notice by the Board (article 15).
A summary of the impact this instrument will have on business has been outlined in the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies this instrument, which is accessible on www.legislation.gov.uk.

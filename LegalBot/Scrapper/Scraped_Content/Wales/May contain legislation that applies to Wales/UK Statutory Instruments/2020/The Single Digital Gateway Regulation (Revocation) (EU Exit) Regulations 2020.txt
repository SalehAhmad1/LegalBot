(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under sections 8(2)(a), 8(2)(b) and 8(2)(d)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 October 2018 establishing a single digital gateway to provide access to information, to procedures and to assistance and problem-solving services and amending Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 (“Regulation (EU) 2018/1724”) facilitates online access to information, administrative procedures and assistance services for citizens and businesses.
Regulation 2 revokes those articles of Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 which are in force and apply immediately before IP completion day and constitute retained EU law under section 3(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
Regulation 3 revokes a provision in Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System and repealing Commission Decision 2008/49/EC (‘the IMI Regulation’) which refers to Regulation (EU) 2018/1724.

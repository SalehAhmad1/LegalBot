21st October 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 2) Order 2019 (“the 2019 Order”).
Article 2(2) amends article 1(c) of the 2019 Order to postpone the date on which the 2019 Order will cease to have effect from 31st December 2020 to 31st October 2021.
Article 2(3) amends article 3 of the 2019 Order as follows:
(a)
sub-paragraph (a) amends article 3 to create a restriction on the driving of a cross-Channel lorry on the local road network in Kent (i.e. most roads in Kent except the motorway network) without a Kent Access Permit. This restriction applies at any time when the restriction on driving a cross-Channel lorry on the motorway network in Kent without a Kent Access Permit applies;
(b)
sub-paragraph (b) amends the opening words of article 3(1) to make it clear that where applicable, the new requirement to have a Kent Access Permit, introduced by sub-paragraph (a), is separate from and additional to the restriction imposed by article 3(1) during a traffic restriction period. It also amends article 3(1)(f) to provide that the driver of a cross-Channel lorry normally kept at an operating centre in East Kent and in possession of a valid local haulier permit which bears the address of that operating centre in East Kent is not subject to the restriction on driving on the local road network set out in article 3(1);
(c)
sub-paragraph (c)(i) and (ii) amend article 3(2) to add definitions of “East Kent” and “Kent Access Permit”;
(d)
sub-paragraph (c)(iii) amends article 3(2) by omitting from the list of local roads in Kent not falling within the definition of “the relevant class of road” a section of the A2 road. This has the effect that that section of road falls within the class of local roads in Kent the use of which is subject to the restrictions set out in the 2019 Order;
(e)
sub-paragraph (d) amends article 3(3) to add a section of the A2070 road to the list of local roads in Kent that are specified roads. This has the effect that a cross-Channel permit is required to use this section of road.

26th November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument amends the Road Vehicles (Display of Registration Marks) Regulations 2001 (S.I 2001/561) (“the Regulations”) by aligning the Regulations with the new British Standard BS AU 145e, which updates the specification for the retroreflecting material used for vehicle number plates which is mandatory from the 1st September 2021 for vehicles first registered from this date, or replacement registration plates fitted from this date. Regulation 5 inserts an early adopters provision (as new regulation 17A of the Regulations) to allow the option for vehicle owners to display a plate conforming with the new British Standard from the coming into force date of 1st January 2021 and before it becomes a mandatory requirement.
Regulations 3 and 7 makes it a mandatory requirement for new registration plates assigned to a vehicle on or after the 1st September 2021, or replacement registration plates fitted on or after this date, to meet the new British Standard, as set out in the new inserted Schedule 2, Part A1, or any other relevant standard or specification recognised for use in an EEA State that offers an equivalent level of performance. The new Part A1 also sets out the requirements for an optional border and dimensions and placement of ‘other markings’ on a registration plate.
Regulation 4 removes the option in regulation 16 of the Regulations for registration plates fixed on or after IP completion day, to display a European Union symbol on a plate or device.
Regulation 6 amends regulation 18 of the Regulations to prescribe an end date of 1st January 1980 to the saving for vehicles that are exempt under paragraph 1A(1) of Schedule 2 to the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994, from being treated as though they were constructed prior to the 1st January 1973, for the purpose of the Regulations.
A draft copy of the relevant parts of this instrument was notified to the EU Commission for the purposes of the Technical Standards and Regulations Directive (2015/1535/EU; OJ L 241, 17.9.2015, p.1).

The Secretary of State makes these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 17(2), 26(3) and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990(1), and by section 2(2) of, and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(2).
The Secretary of State is a Minister designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in relation to food and drink intended for sale for human consumption, including the presentation, packaging, labelling, marketing and advertising of such food and drink(3).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Secretary of State that it is expedient for references to Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers(4) and to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/775 laying down rules for the application of Article 26(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers, as regards the rules for indicating the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient of a food(5) to be construed as references to those instruments as amended from time to time.
The Secretary of State has had regard to relevant advice given by the Food Standards Agency in accordance with section 48(4A) of the Food Safety Act 1990(6).
There has been consultation as required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(7), during the preparation, evaluation and revision of food law in relation to these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Food Information Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1855) (“the 2014 Regulations”) to make provision to enforce, in England, Article 26(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers (“Article 26(3)”) as read with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/775 laying down rules for the application of Article 26(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers, as regards the rules for indicating the country of origin or place of provenance of the primary ingredient of a food (“the Commission Regulation”).
Regulation 2 amends Schedule 5 to the 2014 Regulations to insert a reference to Article 26(3) and the Commission Regulation. The effect of this is that regulation 12 of the 2014 Regulations applies certain provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 (1990 c.16) in relation to those provisions. This includes the application (with modifications) of section 10(1) of that Act, which enables an improvement notice to be served requiring compliance with Article 26(3) as read with the Commission Regulation. Section 10(2) of that Act, as so applied, makes the failure to comply with an improvement notice an offence.

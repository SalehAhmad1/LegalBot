Passengers who have been in or transited through a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory, must self‑isolate until 14 days have elapsed since the day after they last left a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory. The removal of Denmark from Schedule A1 will not affect passengers who arrive in England before 4.00 a.m. on 6th November 2020. The removal of Germany and Sweden from Schedule A1 will not affect passengers who arrive in England before 4.00 a.m. on 7th November 2020.

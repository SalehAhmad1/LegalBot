(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for the purpose of regulating abortions in Northern Ireland following the repeal, by section 9 of the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019, of sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861(1).
These Regulations revoke the Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/345). These Regulations are materially the same as the Regulations revoked, except that cross-references in paragraph 7 in the Schedule to the Regulations have been corrected.
The Regulations authorise abortions to be carried out by a ‘registered medical professional’, as defined in regulation 2, in a place referred to in regulation 8 where one of the grounds set out in regulations 3 to 7 is fulfilled. The remaining regulations deal with certification and notification of various matters by registered medical professionals, offences, conscientious objection and consequential amendments.
Regulation 16 makes transitional provision to ensure that the revoking and replacement of the Abortion (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020 does not have any practical consequences.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

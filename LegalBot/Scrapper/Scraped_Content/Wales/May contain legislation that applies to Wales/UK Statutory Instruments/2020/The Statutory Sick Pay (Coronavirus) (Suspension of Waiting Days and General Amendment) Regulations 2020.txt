Regulation 2(1)
“SCHEDULE 
ISOLATION DUE TO CORONAVIRUS
1.  A person is isolating himself from other people in such a manner as to prevent infection or contamination with coronavirus in accordance with this Schedule if he is doing so pursuant to paragraphs 2 to 5.
2.  The person has symptoms of coronavirus, however mild, and is staying at home for 7 days, beginning with the day (“day 1”) the symptoms started.
3.  The person lives with someone who is isolating himself in accordance with paragraph 2, and that person is staying at home for 14 days, beginning with day 1.
4.  The person is staying at home under paragraph 3 and develops the symptoms of coronavirus, however mild, and is staying at home for 7 days, beginning with the day the symptoms started.
5.  Where the person is staying at home pursuant to paragraph 4, paragraph 3 no longer applies to that person.
6.  In this Schedule–
“Chief Medical Officer” means—
(a)
the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social Care; and
(b)
the Officer with corresponding functions in relation to Scotland and Wales;
“Deputy Chief Medical Officer” is to be construed by reference to the definition of “Chief Medical Officer”; and
“symptoms of coronavirus” means the recent onset of —
(a)
a continuous cough;
(b)
a high temperature;
(c)
both a continuous cough and a high temperature; or
(d)
any other symptoms of coronavirus as may be specified by the Chief Medical Officer or one of the Deputy Chief Medical Officers in guidance as amended from time to time.”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations suspend the limitation, set out in section 155(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, that Statutory Sick Pay is not payable for the first three qualifying days in a period of entitlement. They also amend the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982 (“the 1982 Regulations”) to specify when a person isolating by reason of coronavirus is deemed to be incapable of work.
Statutory sick pay is not payable for the first three qualifying days of a period of entitlement to statutory sick pay. These days are known as “waiting days”. Regulation 2 disapplies the waiting days where an employee is incapable of doing the work the employee can reasonably be expected to do under the employee's contract of service, or where the employee is deemed to be incapable, because of coronavirus. This applies retrospectively from 13th March 2020.
Regulation 3 amends the 1982 Regulations. It inserts a Schedule into those Regulations which specifies when a person is deemed to be incapable of work because the person is staying at home. This includes persons with symptoms of coronavirus staying at home for 7 days and persons living in the household of a person with symptoms of coronavirus staying at home for 14 days.
Regulations 4 and 5 omit the provision that previous Regulations amending the 1982 Regulations will expire after 8 months. The Secretary of State will keep the provisions under review in line with corresponding provision in the Coronavirus Act 2020.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations in view of the urgency required to provide additional financial support to those unable to work as a result of coronavirus.

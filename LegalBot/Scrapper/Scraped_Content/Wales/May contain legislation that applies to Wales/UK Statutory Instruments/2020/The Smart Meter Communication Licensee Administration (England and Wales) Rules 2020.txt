(2) In calculating the amount of any debt for this purpose, no account is to be taken of any amount attributable to the exercise of any right under the relevant agreement so far as the right has become exercisable solely by virtue of the making of an SMCL administration application or any matter arising as a consequence, or of the SMCL entering SMCL administration.Resolutions
35.—(1) Except where this Rule provides otherwise, a resolution is passed at a creditors’ meeting when a majority (in value) of those voting (in person or by proxy) have voted in favour of it.

(3) In the case of a resolution for the nomination of a person to act as liquidator once the SMCL administration has ended—
(a)
subject to paragraph (4), if on any vote there are two persons put forward by creditors for nomination as liquidator, the person who obtains the most support is nominated as liquidator;
(b)
if there are three or more persons put forward by creditors for nomination as liquidator and one of them has a clear majority over both or all the others together, that one is nominated as liquidator;
(c)
in any other case, the chair of the meeting must continue to take votes (disregarding at each vote any person who has withdrawn and, if no person has withdrawn, the person who obtained the least support last time), until a clear majority is obtained for any one person.
(4) The support referred to in paragraph (3)(a) must represent a majority (in value) of all those present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting and entitled to vote.
(5) Where on such a resolution no person is nominated as liquidator, the person named as proposed liquidator in the SMCL administrator’s proposals or revised proposals under Rules 21(7) or 25(3)(e) is nominated to act as liquidator once the SMCL administration has ended.
(6) The chair may at any time put to the meeting a resolution for the joint appointment of any two or more persons put forward by creditors for nomination as liquidator.

57.—(1) The SMCL administrator must estimate the value of any debt which, by reason of its being subject to any contingency or for any other reason, does not have a certain value; and the SMCL administrator may revise any estimate previously made, if the SMCL administrator thinks fit by reference to any change of circumstances or to information becoming available.
(2) The SMCL administrator must inform the creditor as to the estimate under paragraph (1) and any revision of it.
(3) Where the value of a debt is estimated under this Rule, the amount provable in the SMCL administration in the case of that debt is that of the estimate for the time being.Discounts

(10) In this Rule “obligation” means an obligation however arising, whether by virtue of an agreement, rule of law or otherwise.Debt in foreign currency
60.—(1) A proof for a debt incurred or payable in a currency other than sterling must state the amount of the debt in that currency.
(2) The SMCL administrator must convert all such debts into sterling at a single rate for each currency determined by the SMCL administrator by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the date on which the SMCL entered SMCL administration.

61.—(1) In the case of rent and other payments of a periodical nature, the creditor may prove for any amounts due and unpaid up to the date on which the SMCL entered SMCL administration.
(2) Where at that date any payment was accruing due, the creditor may prove for so much as would have been due at that date, if accruing from day to day.Interest
62.—(1) Where a debt proved in the SMCL administration bears interest, that interest is provable as part of the debt except in so far as it is payable in respect of any period after the relevant date.
(2) In the circumstances set out in this Rule, the creditor’s claim may include interest on the debt for periods before the relevant date although not previously reserved or agreed.
(3) If the debt is due by virtue of a written instrument, and payable at a certain time, interest may be claimed for the period from that time to the relevant date.
(4) If the debt is due otherwise, interest may only be claimed if, before the relevant date, demand for payment of the debt was made in writing by or on behalf of the creditor, and notice was given that interest would be payable from the date of the demand to the date of payment.
(5) Interest under paragraph (4) may only be claimed for the period from the date of the demand to the relevant date and, for the purposes of the 1986 Act and these Rules, must be charged at a rate not exceeding that mentioned in paragraph (6).

65.—(1) A secured creditor may, with the agreement of the SMCL administrator or the permission of the court, at any time alter the value which the secured creditor’s proof puts upon the secured creditor’s security.
(2) However, if a secured creditor has voted in respect of the unsecured balance of the secured creditor’s debt the secured creditor may re-value the secured creditor’s security only with permission of the court.Surrender for non-disclosure
66.—(1) If a secured creditor fails to disclose a security in the secured creditor’s proof, the secured creditor must surrender that security for the general benefit of creditors, unless the court, on application by the secured creditor, relieves the secured creditor from the effect of this Rule on the grounds that the omission was inadvertent or the result of honest mistake.
(2) If the court grants that relief, it may require or allow the creditor’s proof to be amended, on such terms as may be just.
(3) Nothing in this Rule or the following two Rules affects the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets (including both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole which change from time to time) belonging to the debtor that are situated outside the United Kingdom.Redemption by SMCL administrator
67.—(1) The SMCL administrator may at any time deliver a notice to a creditor whose debt is secured that the SMCL administrator proposes, at the expiration of 28 days from the date of the notice, to redeem the security at the value put upon it in the creditor’s proof.
(2) The creditor then has 21 days (or such longer period as the SMCL administrator may allow) in which, if the creditor so wishes, to alter the value of the creditor’s security in accordance with Rule 65.
(3) If the creditor alters the value of the security in accordance with Rule 65, the SMCL administrator may only redeem at the new value.
(4) If the SMCL administrator redeems the security, the cost of transferring it is payable out of the assets of the SMCL.
(5) A secured creditor may at any time deliver a notice to the SMCL administrator requiring the SMCL administrator to elect whether or not to redeem the security at the value then placed on it; and the SMCL administrator then has three months in which to redeem the security or elect not to redeem the security.Test of security’s value
68.—(1) If the SMCL administrator is dissatisfied with the value which a secured creditor puts on the creditor’s security (whether in the creditor’s proof or by way of revaluation under Rule 65), the SMCL administrator may require any property comprised in the security to be offered for sale.
(2) The terms of the sale must be such as may be agreed between the SMCL administrator and the secured creditor, or as the court may direct; and if the sale is by auction, the SMCL administrator on behalf of the SMCL, and the creditor on the creditor’s own behalf, may appear and bid.
(3) This Rule does not apply if the value of the security has been altered with the court’s permission.Realisation of security by creditor
69.  If a creditor who has valued the creditor’s security subsequently realises it (whether or not at the instance of the SMCL administrator)—

the net amount realised must be treated in all respects (including in relation to any valuation in a proof) as an amended valuation made by the creditor; and
(b)
the creditor may prove for the balance of the creditor’s debt.Distribution to creditors generally
70.—(1) This Chapter applies where the SMCL administrator makes, or proposes to make, a distribution to any class of creditors other than secured creditors.

71.  Debts other than preferential debts rank equally between themselves in the SMCL administration and, after the preferential debts, must be paid in full unless the assets are insufficient for meeting them, in which case they abate in equal proportions between themselves.Supplementary provisions as to dividend
72.—(1) In the calculation and distribution of a dividend the SMCL administrator must make provision for—
(a)
any debts which appear to the SMCL administrator to be due to persons who, by reason of the distance of their place of residence, may not have had sufficient time to tender and establish their proofs;
(b)
any debts which are the subject of claims which have not yet been determined; and
(c)
disputed proofs and claims.
(2) A creditor who has not proved the creditor’s debt before the declaration of any dividend is not entitled to disturb, by reason that the creditor has not participated in it, the distribution of that dividend or any other dividend declared before the creditor’s debt was proved, but—
(a)
when the creditor has proved that debt the creditor is entitled to be paid, out of any money for the time being available for the payment of any further dividend, any dividend which the creditor has failed to receive; and
(b)
any dividend payable under sub-paragraph (a) must be paid before the money is applied to the payment of any such further dividend.
(3) No action lies against the SMCL administrator for a dividend, but if the SMCL administrator refuses to pay a dividend the court may, if it thinks just, order the SMCL administrator to pay it and also to pay, out of the SMCL administrator’s own money—
(a)
interest on the dividend, at the rate for the time being specified in section 17 of the Judgments Act 1838, from the time when it was withheld; and

(b)

(c)
require the creditor to notify the SMCL administrator by the last date for proving if the amount of the debt is incorrect or if no debt is owed; and
(d)

(3) The information required by paragraph (2)(a) may take the form of a list of small debts which the SMCL administrator intends to treat as proved which includes the debt owed to the particular creditor to whom the notice is being delivered.Sole or final dividend
75.—(1) Where it is intended that the distribution is to be a sole or final dividend, the SMCL administrator must, after the last date for proving set out in the notice under Rule 73—
(a)
pay any sums payable in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 99 of Schedule B1 to the 1986 Act;
(b)

(c)
declare and distribute that dividend without regard to the claim of any person in respect of a debt not already proved.
(2) The reference in paragraph (1)(c) to debts that have not been proved does not include small debts treated as proved by the SMCL administrator.

(2) The SMCL administrator is not obliged to deal with a proof delivered after the last date for proving, but may do so, if the SMCL administrator thinks fit.
(3) In the declaration of a dividend a payment must not be made more than once in respect of the same debt.Postponement or cancellation of dividend
77.  The SMCL administrator may postpone or cancel a dividend, if in the period of two months referred to in Rule 73(2)(c) an application is made to the court for the SMCL administrator’s decision on a proof to be reversed or varied, or for a proof to be excluded, or for a reduction of the amount claimed.Declaration of dividend

(a)
that no funds have been realised; or
(b)
that the funds realised have already been distributed or used or allocated for paying the expenses of SMCL administration.Proof altered after payment of dividend
82.—(1) If after payment of dividend the amount claimed by a creditor in the creditor’s proof is increased, the creditor is not entitled to disturb the distribution of the dividend; but the creditor is entitled to be paid, out of any money for the time being available for the payment of any further dividend, any dividend which the creditor has failed to receive.
(2) Any dividend payable under paragraph (1) must be paid before the money there referred to is applied to the payment of any such further dividend.
(3) If, after a creditor’s proof has been admitted, the proof is withdrawn or excluded, or the amount is reduced, the creditor is liable to repay to the SMCL administrator, for the credit of the SMCL administration, any amount overpaid by way of dividend.Secured creditors
83.—(1) The following applies where a creditor alters the value of the creditor’s security at a time when a dividend has been declared.
(2) If the alteration results in a reduction of the creditor’s unsecured claim ranking for dividend, the creditor must as soon as reasonably practicable repay to the SMCL administrator, for the credit of the SMCL administration, any amount received by the creditor as dividend in excess of that to which the creditor would be entitled having regard to the alteration of the value of the security.
(3) If the alteration results in an increase of the creditor’s unsecured claim, the creditor is entitled to receive from the SMCL administrator, out of any money for the time being available for the payment of a further dividend, before any such further dividend is paid, any dividend which the creditor has failed to receive, having regard to the alteration of the value of the security.
(4) However, the creditor is not entitled to disturb any dividend declared (whether or not distributed) before the date of the alteration.Disqualification from dividend

If a creditor contravenes any provision of the 1986 Act or these Rules relating to the valuation of securities, the court may, on the application of the SMCL administrator, order that the creditor be wholly or partly disqualified from participation in any dividend.Assignment of right to dividend
85.—(1) If a person entitled to a dividend (“the entitled person”) delivers notice to the SMCL administrator that the entitled person wishes the dividend to be paid to another person, or that the entitled person has assigned the entitlement to another person, the SMCL administrator must pay the dividend to that other person accordingly.
(2) A notice delivered under this Rule must specify the name and address of the person to whom payment is to be made.Adjustment where dividend paid before time
86.—(1) Where a creditor has proved for a debt of which payment is not due at the date of the declaration of a dividend, the creditor is entitled to the dividend equally with other creditors, but subject as follows.
(2) For the purpose of dividend (and no other purpose), the amount of the creditor’s admitted proof (or, if a distribution has previously been made to the creditor, the amount remaining outstanding in respect of the creditor’s admitted proof) is to be reduced by applying the following formula—
where—
(a)
“x” is the value of the admitted proof; and
(b)
“n” is the period beginning with the date on which the SMCL entered SMCL administration and ending with the date on which the payment of the creditor’s debt would otherwise be due expressed in years (part of a year being expressed as a decimal fraction of a year).Division of unsold assets

(d)
the value and nature of the property with which the SMCL administrator has to deal.

(7) If the SMCL administrator is a solicitor and employs the SMCL administrator’s own firm, or any partner in it, to act on behalf of the SMCL, profit costs must not be paid unless this is authorised by the court.Remuneration of new SMCL administrator
89.  If a new SMCL administrator is appointed in place of another, any court order in effect under Rule 88 immediately before the former SMCL administrator ceased to hold office continues to apply in respect of the remuneration of the new SMCL administrator until a further court order is made in accordance with those provisions.Final progress reports

142.—(1) This Part applies in any case where a proxy is given in relation to a meeting or proceedings under Schedule B1 to the 1986 Act or these Rules, or where a corporation authorises a person to represent it.
(2) References in this Part to “the chair” are to the chair of the meeting for which a specific proxy is given or at which a continuing proxy is exercised.Specific and continuing proxies
143.—(1) A “proxy” is a document made by a creditor, member or contributory which directs or authorises another person (“the proxy-holder”) to act as the representative of the creditor, member or contributory at a meeting or meetings by speaking, voting, abstaining or proposing resolutions.
(2) A proxy may be either—
(a)
a specific proxy which relates to a specific meeting; or
(b)
a continuing proxy for the SMCL administration proceedings.
(3) A specific proxy must—
(a)
direct the proxy-holder how to act at the meeting by giving specific instructions;
(b)
authorise the proxy-holder to act at the meeting without specific instructions; or
(c)
contain both direction and authorisation.
(4) A proxy is to be treated as a specific proxy for the meeting which is identified in the proxy unless it states that it is a continuing proxy for the SMCL administration proceedings.
(5) A continuing proxy must authorise the proxy-holder to attend, speak, vote or abstain, or to propose resolutions without giving the proxy-holder any specific instructions how to do so.
(6) A continuing proxy may be superseded by a proxy for a specific meeting or withdrawn by notice delivered to the SMCL administrator.
(7) A creditor, member or contributory may appoint more than one person to be proxy-holder but if so—
(a)
their appointment is as alternates; and
(b)
only one of them may act as proxy-holder at a meeting.
(8) The proxy-holder must be an individual.Blank proxy
144.—(1) A “blank proxy” is a document which—
(a)
complies with the requirements in this Rule; and
(b)

(2) A blank proxy must state that the creditor, member or contributory named in the document (when completed) appoints a person who is named or identified as the proxy-holder of the creditor, member or contributory.
(3) The specified details are—
(a)
the name and address of the creditor, member or contributory;
(b)
either the name of the proxy-holder or the identification of the proxy-holder (e.g. the chair of the meeting);
(c)
whether the proxy is—
(i)
for a specific meeting which is identified in the proxy; or
(ii)
a continuing proxy for the proceedings; and
(d)
if the proxy is for a specific meeting, instructions as to the extent to which the proxy-holder is directed to vote in a particular way, to abstain or to propose any resolution.
(4) When it is delivered to the creditor, member or contributory, a blank proxy must not already have inserted in it the name or description of any person as proxy-holder or instructions as to how a person appointed as proxy-holder is to act.
(5) A blank proxy must have a note to the effect that the proxy may be completed with the name of the person or the chair of the meeting who is to be proxy-holder.Use of proxies
145.—(1) A proxy for a specific meeting must be delivered to the chair before the meeting.
(2) A continuing proxy must be delivered to the SMCL administrator and may be exercised at any meeting which begins after the proxy is delivered.
(3) A proxy may be used at the resumption of the meeting after an adjournment, but if a different proxy is given for use at a resumed meeting, that proxy must be delivered to the chair before the start of the resumed meeting.
(4) Where a specific proxy directs a proxy-holder to vote for or against a resolution for the appointment of a person other than the SMCL administrator as proposed liquidator of the SMCL, the proxy-holder may, unless the proxy states otherwise, vote for or against (as the proxy-holder thinks fit) a resolution for the nomination or appointment of that person jointly with another or others.
(5) A proxy-holder may propose a resolution which is one on which the proxy-holder could vote if someone else proposed it.
(6) Where a proxy gives specific directions as to voting, this does not, unless the proxy states otherwise, prohibit the proxy-holder from exercising discretion how to vote on a resolution which is not dealt with by the proxy.
(7) The chair may require a proxy used at a meeting to be the same as or substantially similar to the blank proxy delivered for that meeting or to a blank proxy previously delivered which has been completed as a continuing proxy.Use of proxies by the chair
146.—(1) Where a proxy appoints the chair (however described in the proxy) as proxy-holder the chair may not refuse to be the proxy-holder.
(2) Where the SMCL administrator is appointed as proxy-holder but another person acts as chair of the meeting, that other person may use the proxies as if that person were the proxy-holder.
(3) Where the chair holds a proxy which includes a requirement to vote for a particular resolution and no other person proposes that resolution—
(a)
the chair must propose it unless the chair considers that there is good reason for not doing so; and
(b)
if the chair does not propose it, the chair must as soon as reasonably practicable after the meeting deliver a notice of the reason why that was not done to the person making the proxy.Right of inspection and retention of proxies
147.—(1) A person attending a meeting is entitled, immediately before or in the course of the meeting, to inspect proxies and associated documents delivered to the chair or to any other person in accordance with the notice convening the meeting.

a member of the SMCL or a contributory, in the case of proxies used at a meeting of the SMCL, or a meeting of contributories; or
(c)
a director of the SMCL.
(4) A creditor in paragraph (3)(a) is a person who has delivered a proof in the proceedings, but does not include a person whose claim has been wholly rejected.
(5) However the right of inspection is subject to Rule 189 (confidentiality of documents- grounds for refusing inspection).Proxy-holder with financial interest
148.—(1) A proxy-holder must not vote for a resolution which would—
(a)
directly or indirectly place the proxy-holder or any associate of the proxy-holder in a position to receive any remuneration, fees or expenses from the assets of the SMCL; or
(b)
fix or change the amount of or the basis of any remuneration, fees or expenses receivable by the proxy-holder or any associate of the proxy-holder out of the assets of the SMCL.
(2) However a proxy-holder may vote for such a resolution if the proxy specifically directs the proxy-holder to vote in that way.
(3) Where an SMCL administrator is appointed as proxy-holder and that proxy is used under Rule 146(2) by another person acting as chair, the SMCL administrator is deemed to be an associate of the person acting as chair.Instrument conferring authorisation to represent corporation

(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules set out the procedure for the conduct of smart meter communication licensee administration (“SMCL administration”) proceedings in England and Wales. SMCL administration is a special insolvency regime specifically created for companies acting as a smart meter communication licensee (“SMCL”) in Great Britain.
The framework for the SMCL administration regime is set out in the Smart Meters Act 2018 (c. 14) (the “2018 Act”). The 2018 Act applies (with modifications) much of Chapter 3 of Part 3 of the Energy Act 2004 (c. 20), which provides for a special insolvency regime for energy companies that run and operate gas and electricity networks in Great Britain.
Only SMCLs as defined in section 2(5) of the 2018 Act may enter SMCL administration. These are companies that hold a licence granted under section 7AB of the Gas Act 1986 (c.44) or a licence granted under section 6 of the Electricity Act 1989 (c.29) to provide a smart meter communication service.
The SMCL administration process is commenced by an application to court for a smart meter communication licensee administration order, referred to as an “SMCL administration order” as defined in section 2(1) of the 2018 Act. Such an application can be made by either the Secretary of State or, with the consent of the Secretary of State, by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority.
An insolvency practitioner appointed to manage the affairs, business and property of the SMCL is defined in section 2(2) of the 2018 Act as an SMCL administrator.
These Rules are applicable only to SMCL administration.
Part 1 of these Rules contains the construction and interpretation provisions.
Part 2 of these Rules sets out the procedure to be followed to initiate SMCL administration proceedings, including the information required for an SMCL administration order application, to whom notice of such an application needs to be delivered and who may appear at a hearing of the SMCL administration application.
Part 3 of these Rules details the initial steps to be taken in SMCL administration proceedings. These include the notification and advertisement of an SMCL administrator’s appointment and the preparation of a statement of the affairs of the SMCL. Part 3 also sets out the information that must be given to creditors in the SMCL administrator’s statement of proposals and the contents of the progress reports to be prepared by the SMCL administrator.
Part 4 of these Rules contains provisions relating to creditors’ and company meetings summoned by the SMCL administrator.
Part 5 of these Rules contains provisions relating to an application to court for authority to dispose of property of the SMCL which is subject to a security (other than a floating charge) or goods in the possession of the SMCL under a hire-purchase agreement.
Part 6 of these Rules contains provisions relating to the expenses of SMCL administration.
Part 7 of these Rules contains provisions relating to claims by and distributions to creditors of the SMCL. In particular, this Part details the procedure to be followed to prove a debt in the SMCL administration proceedings as well as the way in which such debts will be quantified and the steps to be taken where the SMCL administrator makes, or proposes to make, a distribution to creditors.
Part 8 of these Rules contains details of how the remuneration of an SMCL administrator is to be fixed by the court.
Part 9 of these Rules sets out the arrangements for ending an SMCL administration. There are specific provisions detailing the ending of an SMCL administration by court order, as well as the process by which an SMCL administration moves into either a creditors’ voluntary liquidation or dissolution of the SMCL.
Part 10 of these Rules sets out the requirements and procedures for replacing an SMCL administrator. It includes provisions relating to the resignation of an SMCL administrator, the removal of an SMCL administrator from office by court order and the SMCL administrator’s duties on vacating office.
Part 11 of these Rules contains general provisions detailing the court procedure and practice for SMCL administration proceedings. In particular this Part sets out the general requirements for court applications made during an SMCL administration, enforcement procedures, access to the court file, the cost assessment procedure for SMCL administration proceedings, provision for persons who lack capacity to manage their affairs, and the appeals process to be used in SMCL administration proceedings.
Part 12 of these Rules contains provisions for the use of proxies and representatives of corporations at meetings held during an SMCL administration, including the rights of inspection of such proxies and the procedure to be followed where a proxy-holder has a financial interest in the outcome of a resolution to be voted on at the meeting.
Part 13 of these Rules sets out the provision for the examination of persons where an application to court has been made by an SMCL administrator under section 236 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45). Section 236 of the Insolvency Act 1986 allows an SMCL administrator to apply to court for an order requiring certain persons to appear before the court to be questioned by the SMCL administrator about the company in SMCL administration.
Part 14 of these Rules contains provisions of general effect including provisions relating to the delivery of documents, the form and content of documents, service of documents, standard contents of notices and of documents delivered to the registrar of companies, the inspection and right to copies of documents, and the calculation of time periods.
Part 15 of these Rules contains miscellaneous provisions, including the power of the Secretary of State to regulate certain matters relating to the carrying out of the SMCL administrator’s functions, provisions relating to the punishment of offences and the requirement for a review.
The Schedule to these Rules contains specific details of the punishment of offences under these Rules.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

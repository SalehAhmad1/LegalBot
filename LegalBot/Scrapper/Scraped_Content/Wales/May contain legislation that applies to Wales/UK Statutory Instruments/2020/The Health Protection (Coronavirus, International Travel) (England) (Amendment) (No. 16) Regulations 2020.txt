These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) (“the principal Regulations”) to amend the amount of fixed penalty payable by a person who fails to self-isolate when required to by regulation 4 of the principal Regulations. They introduce a “laddering” system whereby the amount payable increases for repeated breaches of the requirement, up to a maximum of £10,000.
The principal Regulations are amended so that the requirement to self-isolate under regulation 4 of the principal Regulations ceases if a person becomes subject to the requirement to self-isolate under regulation 2(2)(a)(i) of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020.

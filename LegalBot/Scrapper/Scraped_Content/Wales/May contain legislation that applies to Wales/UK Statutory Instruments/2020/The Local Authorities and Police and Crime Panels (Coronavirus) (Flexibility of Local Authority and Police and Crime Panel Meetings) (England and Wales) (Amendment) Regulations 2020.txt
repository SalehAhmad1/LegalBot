27th July 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the provision made by the Local Authorities and Police and Crime Panels (Coronavirus) (Flexibility of Local Authority and Police and Crime Panel Meetings) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020 (“the 2020 Regulations”) for the conduct of local authority meetings held before 7th May 2021, and for public and press access to these meetings.
Regulation 2 firstly amends the definition of “local authority” in the 2020 Regulations to include Mayoral Development Corporations, Transport for London, Urban Development Corporations and parish meetings, to enable these bodies to hold and alter the frequency and occurrence of meetings without requirement for further notice and to provide for members of these bodies to attend meetings remotely. Secondly, it modifies legislation relating to public and press access to information about decisions made by local authorities. The modifications made will enable access through remote means. Thirdly, regulation 2 disapplies provisions requiring a parish meeting to hold an annual meeting and modifies provisions requiring a parish meeting to give public notice of meetings.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument will have no impact on the costs of business and the voluntary sector.

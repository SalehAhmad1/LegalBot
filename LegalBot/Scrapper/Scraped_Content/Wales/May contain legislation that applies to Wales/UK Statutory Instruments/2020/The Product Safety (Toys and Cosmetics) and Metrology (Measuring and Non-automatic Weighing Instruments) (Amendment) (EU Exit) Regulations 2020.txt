8th December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amends two sets of Regulations: the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (UK(NI) Indication) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1460) (“the first instrument”) and the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1112) (“the second instrument”).
Schedule 3 to the first instrument extends to Great Britain (England and Wales and Scotland) and amends the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2020/696) (“the 2019 Regulations”). Schedule 15 of the 2019 Regulations extends to Great Britain only and amends prospectively (with effect from IP completion day) the Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1881). Paragraph 9(4) of Schedule 3 to the first instrument prospectively amends Schedule 15 of the 2019 Regulations to, amongst other things, include provision for toys which are qualifying Northern Ireland goods to able to be made available on the market of Great Britain, by inserting a new regulation 39AB into the Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011. There is an error in the new regulation 39AB(3((B)(iii) in that it refers to “regulated measuring instrument” instead of “toy”. Regulation 2 of these Regulations corrects that error.
The second instrument extends to Northern Ireland only and amends prospectively (with effect from IP completion day) a number of pieces of legislation including the Cosmetic Products Enforcement Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/1478) (see Schedule 6), the Non-automatic Weighing Instruments Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/1152) (see Schedule 13) and the Measuring Instruments Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/1153) (see Schedule 14). These Regulations correct errors in those Schedules.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

S.I. 2006/2656.Richard Tilbrook
Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order forms part of implementation in the United Kingdom of the Council of Europe Convention on Cinematographic Co-production (revised) 2017 (“the 2017 Convention”), which was signed by the United Kingdom on 7th February 2019. The 2017 Convention replaces (subject to transitional provision) the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production 1992 (“the 1992 Convention”).
In particular, the 2017 Convention applies to a co-produced film where some or all of the contributors are established in a Contracting Party to the 2017 Convention, and none of the contributors are established in a Contracting Party to the 1992 Convention which is not a Contracting Party to the 2017 Convention (a “1992 Convention Only Party”). Accordingly, where one or more contributors to a co-production is established in a 1992 Convention Only Party, the 1992 Convention continues to apply.
This Order therefore provides that a co-produced film to which either the 2017 Convention or the 1992 Convention applies, and that is made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Convention, is to be treated as a British film for the purposes of Schedule 1 to the Films Act 1985.
Additional requirements apply for a film to be treated as a British film. Where there are only two co-producers one must be established in the United Kingdom and the other in a State which is a Contracting Party to the applicable Convention. Where there are three or more co-producers one must be established in the United Kingdom and at least two others in different States each of which is a Contracting Party to at least one of the 1992 Convention and the 2017 Convention.
A list of the current Contracting Parties to the 2017 Convention and the 1992 Convention is available from the Council of Europe website (www.coe.int) and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (www.culture.gov.uk).
This Order revokes and replaces the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/2656).
A full impact assessment has not been published for this Order as it has minimal impact on the private sector, the voluntary sector or civil society organisations.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in airspace in the vicinity of Headcorn/Lashenden 
Aerodrome, Kent, during air displays that are scheduled to take place there on 25th, 26th and 27th 
September 2020 (inclusive). Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the 
displays and therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and Department for Transport agree that flying 
should be restricted in the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
In relation to regulation 3, the term ‘aircraft’ includes aircraft as classified by Part 1 of Schedule 4 
to the Air Navigation Order 2016. It also includes, by virtue of article 23 of that Order, any small 
balloon, any kite weighing not more than two kilograms, any small unmanned aircraft and any 
parachute including a parascending parachute. 
The times mentioned in regulations 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC), which for the 
purpose of these Regulations is one hour behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2), the Battle of Britain Air Show flying 
display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of the Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice To Airmen (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr C W Scott, Principal Airspace 
Regulator, Safety and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 382997.

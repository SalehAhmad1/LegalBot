Parts 2 and 3 make amendments to legislation relating to animal health and welfare, and animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products including alien and locally absent species in aquaculture.
Parts 4 and 5, which apply in relation to the marketing of seed, plant and plant propagating material, including seed potatoes and forest reproductive material, make provision for certain functions of the European Commission of a legislative character to be exercisable instead by the Secretary of State, the Welsh Ministers or the Scottish Ministers.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

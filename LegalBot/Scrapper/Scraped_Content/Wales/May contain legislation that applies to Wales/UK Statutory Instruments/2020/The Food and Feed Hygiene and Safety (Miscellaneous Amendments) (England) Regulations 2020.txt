Laid before Parliament

Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1
The Secretary of State makes these Regulations apart from regulations 4(17), (18), (19) and (20) in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of, and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(1).
The Secretary of State has been designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in relation to measures relating to food (including drink) including the primary production of food and measures relating to feed produced for or fed to food-producing animals(2), the common agricultural policy of the European Union(3), the control and regulation of genetically modified organisms(4) and measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields for the protection of public health(5).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Secretary of State that it is expedient for references to EU instruments inserted into various statutory instruments by these Regulations to be construed as references to those instruments as amended from time to time.
The Secretary of State makes regulations 4(17), (18), (19) and (20) in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 16(2), 26(1)(a), (2)(a) and (3), 31 and 48(1) of the Food Safety Act 1990(6), and now vested in him(7).
In accordance with section 48(4A) of the 1990 Act he has had regard to relevant advice given by the Food Standards Agency.
As required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(8), there has been open and transparent public consultation during the preparation and evaluation of these Regulations.

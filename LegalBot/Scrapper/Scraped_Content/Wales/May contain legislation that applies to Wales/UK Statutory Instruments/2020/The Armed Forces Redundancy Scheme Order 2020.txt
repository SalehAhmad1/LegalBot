Interpretation of this Part
16.—[F3(1)] In this Part—
“AFRS 2010 redundancy reckonable service” in relation to a person means service that would have counted as redundancy reckonable service under the AFRS 2010 had the person been eligible for a payment under that scheme, and
“total service”, in relation to a person, means the sum of their redundancy qualifying service and their AFRS 2010 redundancy reckonable service.
[F4(2) For the purposes of this Part, where a remedy member with remediable service under the AFPS 1975 makes a section 6 election under Schedule 4 (remediable service) to the AFPS 1975, their AFRS 2010 redundancy reckonable service does not include any period of remediable service which would otherwise have counted as such redundancy reckonable service.]

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Armed Forces Redundancy Scheme Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/55) and the Armed Forces (Redundancy, Resettlement and Gratuity Earnings (Schemes) (No. 2) Order 2010 (S.I. 2010/832), and establishes a new redundancy scheme for members of the Armed Forces: the Armed Forces Redundancy Scheme 2020 (“the AFRS 2020”).
Part 1 of the Order provides that it comes into force on 1st January 2021.
Part 2 of the Order establishes the AFRS 2020.
Part 3 of the Order amends the Armed Forces Redundancy Scheme 2006 to reflect the introduction of flexible service under the Armed Forces (Flexible Working) Act 2018, and to add further detail regarding eligibility and criteria.

The Schedule to the Order sets out the rules of the AFRS 2020. This is a redundancy compensation scheme for service personnel who were, immediately before ceasing service, either active members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2015 or who were entitled to active membership of that scheme but who had opted out of such membership. The AFRS 2020 applies to regular armed forces, and to members of the reserve forces who are on either a full time reserve service commitment or an additional duties commitment at the time their service ceases.
Part 1 of the Schedule contains definitions of terms used in the AFRS 2020 and methods of calculation.
Part 2 of the Schedule contains the rules relating to eligibility for, entitlement to and amount of compensation.
Part 3 of the Schedule makes transitional provision for persons who, before 1st April 2015, were active members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975.

9th March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends Part I of Schedule 2 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (c. 69), which lists birds that may be killed or taken outside the close season, meaning to do so would not be an offence under section 1 of that Act. The list currently includes the White-fronted Goose (in England and Wales only).
Article 2 excludes the Greenland White-fronted Goose from Part I of Schedule 2 in England, meaning that this sub-species can no longer be killed or taken outside the close season.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

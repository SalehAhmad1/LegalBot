27th February 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Part 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) makes provision about proscribed organisations (including setting out offences in relation to such organisations in sections 11 to 13). An organisation is proscribed if it is listed in Schedule 2 to that Act or, in most cases, if it operates under the same name as an organisation so listed (section 3(1)).
Article 2 of this Order amends Schedule 2. Article 2(3) substitutes a new entry in place of the existing entry for the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), so that this entry expressly includes two aliases of the group and corrects the spelling. Article 2(2) removes an existing separate entry for one of these aliases, as this is no longer necessary. Article 2(4) adds Sonnenkrieg Division to the list in Schedule 2 as a new entry.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

EUR 178/2002, as prospectively amended by S.I. 2019/641.Eluned Morgan
Minister for Mental Health, Wellbeing and Welsh Language, one of the Welsh Ministers
17 December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraphs 1(1) and 11M(1) of Schedule 2, paragraph 7 of Schedule 4, and paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7, to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of food and feed safety and hygiene.
Part 2 contains amendments to provisions of Welsh EU Exit subordinate legislation. Amendments include correction of identified errors, and provision required to implement the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the EU withdrawal agreement. Part 2 also omits a number of provisions that were included to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The omitted provisions either no longer apply or the amendments made by those provisions are replaced by other amendments made by these Regulations.
Part 3 contains amendments to subordinate legislation that apply in relation to Wales, in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and to implement the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. A number of the amendments consolidate and update (with amendment) provisions included in earlier EU Exit subordinate legislation that are omitted in Part 2 of these Regulations.
Part 4 makes a saving provision.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

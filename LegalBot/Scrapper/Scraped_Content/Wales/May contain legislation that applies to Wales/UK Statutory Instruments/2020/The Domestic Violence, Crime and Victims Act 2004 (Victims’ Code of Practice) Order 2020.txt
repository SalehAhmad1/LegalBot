In accordance with sections 32 and 33 of the Act, the Secretary of State brought into operation on 16th November 2015 a code of practice as to the services to be provided to a victim of criminal conduct by persons appearing to him to have functions relating to victims of criminal conduct or any aspect of the criminal justice system. Under section 33(8) of the Act, the Secretary of State for Justice may from time to time revise a code previously brought into operation.
In accordance with sections 33(2) to (4) of the Act, in preparing a draft of the revised code, the Secretary of State for Justice consulted the Attorney General and the Secretary of State for the Home Department and after doing so published it and specified a period during which representations about the draft may be made to him.

In accordance with section 33(9) of the Act, it appears to the Secretary of State for Justice that the proposed revisions would not result in a significant reduction in the quality or extent of the services to be provided under the code, or a significant restriction in the description of persons to whom services are to be provided under the code.

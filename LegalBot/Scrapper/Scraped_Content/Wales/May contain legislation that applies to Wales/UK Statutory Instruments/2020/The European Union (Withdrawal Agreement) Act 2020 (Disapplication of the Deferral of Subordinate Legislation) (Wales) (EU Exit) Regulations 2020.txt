30 January 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 4 of the withdrawal agreement provides for the implementation period (or transition period).
Paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 5 to the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1) gives legal effect to the implementation period by non-textually amending the coming into force dates of subordinate legislation which come into force immediately before exit day, on exit day or at any time after exit day. This subordinate legislation will instead come into force immediately before the end of the implementation period (IP completion day), on IP completion day or (as the case may be) at the time concerned after IP completion day.
Regulation 2 provides that paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 5 will not apply to the Elections (Wales) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 so they will continue to come into force on exit day.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

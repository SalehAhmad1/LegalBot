At 9.30 a.m. on 5th May 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations partially implement Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants (recast) (OJ No. L 169, 25.6.2019, p. 45).
Regulation 2(3) amends regulation 4 of the Environmental Protection (Disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyls and other Dangerous Substances) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/1043) (“2000 Regulations”), in particular by replacing paragraph (3) with new paragraphs (3A) to (3D).
This amendment partially implements the second sentence of the entry in the fourth column of the row relating to Polychlorinated Biphenyls in the table at Part A of Annex 1 to Regulation (EU) 2019/1021. That sentence provides that Member States shall identify and remove from use equipment (e.g. transformers, capacitors or other receptacles containing liquid stocks) containing more than 0.005 % PCBs and volumes greater than 0.05 dm3, as soon as possible but no later than 31st December 2025.
The remaining provisions make related changes to the 2000 Regulations, in particular to regulation 13 (offences and penalties), regulation 13A (civil sanctions in England) and regulation 13B (civil sanctions in Wales).

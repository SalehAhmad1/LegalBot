INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING
The Southampton to London Pipeline Development Consent Order 2020
Made
7th October 2020
Coming into force
29th October 2020
An application has been made to the Secretary of State under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008(1) (“the 2008 Act”) and in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009(2) for an Order granting development consent.
The application was examined by a panel of four members (“the Panel”) (appointed by the Secretary of State) in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act, and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010(3).
The Panel, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn and the application together with the accompanying documents, in accordance with section 74 of the 2008 Act, has submitted a report with a recommendation to the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State, has considered the representations made and not withdrawn, the report of the Panel and the environmental information in accordance with regulation 4 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017(4) and has had regard to the documents and matters referred to in section 104(2) of the 2008 Act.
The Secretary of State having decided the application has determined to make an Order granting development consent for the development described in the application on terms which in the opinion of the Secretary of State are not materially different to the proposals comprised in the application.
The Secretary of State is satisfied that the parcels of common, open space or fuel or field allotment land comprised within the Order limits (as identified in the Book of Reference), when burdened with rights imposed by this Order, will be no less advantageous than they were before to persons in whom they are vested, other persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other rights and the public, and that accordingly, section 132(3) of the 2008 Act applies.
The Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 114, 115 and 120 of the 2008 Act, makes the following Order—

and that person must, as soon as reasonably practicable after such re-interment or cremation, provide to the undertaker a certificate for the purpose of enabling compliance with paragraph (11).
(7) If the undertaker is not satisfied that any person giving notice under paragraph (5) is the personal representative or relative as that person claims to be, or that the remains in question can be identified, the question is to be determined on the application of either party in a summary manner by the county court, and the court may make an order specifying who must remove the remains and as to the payment of the costs of the application.

so far as any such agreement relates to the terms on which any land which is the subject of a lease granted by or under that agreement is to be provided for that person’s use.
(2) No enactment or rule of law regulating the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants prejudices the operation of any agreement to which this article applies.
(3) No enactment or rule of law to which paragraph (2) applies is to apply in relation to the rights and obligations of the parties to any lease granted by or under any such agreement so as to—
(a)
exclude or in any respect modify any of the rights and obligations of those parties under the terms of the lease, whether with respect to the termination of the tenancy or any other matter;
(b)
confer or impose on any such party any right or obligation arising out of or connected with anything done or omitted on or in relation to land which is the subject of the lease, in addition to any such right or obligation provided for by the terms of the lease; or

restrict the enforcement (whether by action for damages or otherwise) by any party to the lease of any obligation of any other party under the lease.Operational land for purposes of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990
39.  Development consent granted by this Order is to be treated as specific planning permission for the purposes of section 264(3)(a) of the 1990 Act (cases in which land is to be treated as not being operational land).Planning permission
40.  If planning permission is issued under the 1990 Act for development any part of which is within the Order limits following the publication of this Order that is—
(a)
not itself a nationally significant infrastructure project under the 2008 Act or part of such a project; and
(b)
required to complete or enable the construction, use or operation of the development authorised by this Order,
then the carrying out, use or operation of such development under the terms of the planning permission does not constitute a breach of the terms of this Order.Defence to proceedings in respect of statutory nuisance
41.—(1) Where proceedings are brought under section 82(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990(1) (summary proceedings by person aggrieved by statutory nuisance) in relation to a nuisance falling within paragraph (g) (noise emitted from premises so as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance) of section 79(1) of that Act no order is to be made, and no fine may be imposed, under section 82(2) of that Act if—
(a)
the defendant shows that the nuisance—
(i)
relates to premises used by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with the construction or maintenance of the authorised development and that the nuisance is attributable to the carrying out of the authorised development in accordance with a notice served under section 60 (control of noise on construction site), or a consent given under section 61 (prior consent for work on construction sites) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974(2); or
(ii)
relates to premises used by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with the construction or maintenance of the authorised development and that the nuisance is attributable to the carrying out of the authorised development in accordance with the controls and measures relating to noise as described in the code of construction practice or the construction environment management plan approved under Schedule 2 (Requirements) or in accordance with the noise levels set out in an environmental permit relating to the operation of the authorised development;
(iii)
is a consequence of the construction or maintenance of the authorised development and that it cannot reasonably be avoided; or
(iv)
is a consequence of complying with a requirement of this Order and that it cannot reasonably be avoided; or
(b)
the defendant shows that the nuisance is a consequence of the use of the authorised development and that it cannot be reasonably avoided.
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) above, compliance with the controls and measures relating to noise described in the code of construction practice and the CEMP will be sufficient, but not necessary, to show that an alleged nuisance could not reasonably be avoided.
(3) Where a relevant planning authority is acting in accordance with section 60(4) and section 61(4) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 in relation to the construction of the authorised development then the local authority must also have regard to the controls and measures relating to noise referred to in the code of construction practice or the CEMP approved under Schedule 2 (Requirements).
(4) Section 61(9) (consent for work on construction site to include statement that it does not of itself constitute a defence to proceedings under section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990) of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 does not apply where the consent relates to the use of premises by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with the construction or maintenance of the authorised development.
(5) In this article “premises” has the same meaning as in section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990(3).

Applications involving multiple relevant authorities under Requirements
24.  Where an application is required to be made to more than one relevant authority for any single consent, agreement or approval under a Requirement, the undertaker may submit a request for comments in respect of its proposed application to each relevant authority and, where it does so, each relevant authority must provide its comments in writing on the proposed application within a period of 20 days beginning with the day immediately following that on which the request is received by the authority, so as to enable the undertaker to prepare a consolidated application to each relevant authority in respect of the consent, agreement or approval required by the Requirement.
Further information
25.—(1) Where an application has been made under Requirement 23 the relevant authority may, subject to complying with the requirements of this paragraph, request such reasonable further information from the undertaker as it considers is necessary to enable it to consider the application.

SCHEDULE 6
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS AND IMPOSITION OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or the imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply in respect of compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 6 to the Southampton to London Pipeline Development Consent Order 2020 (“the 2020 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 6 to the 2020 Order to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 26 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 21 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 23 (compulsory acquisition of rights and restrictive covenants)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4 are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restrictive covenant is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation) of the 1965 Act substitute—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to compulsory acquisition under article 21), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 26(4) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and has not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 as applied by article 27 (application of the 1981 Act) of the Southampton to London Pipeline Development Consent Order 2020 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 28(3) (acquisition of subsoil and airspace only) of the Southampton to London Pipeline Development Consent Order 2020 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the proposed use of the right or covenant, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed the utility undertaker must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 48, and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
9.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses and costs
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker all expenses reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2).
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under subparagraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 5 or 7(2), or by reason of any subsidence resulting from such development or works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
(c)
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Cooperation
12.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, the undertaker or a utility undertaker requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 7(2) or a utility undertaker makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 9, the undertaker must use best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the utility undertaker’s undertaking and each utility undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
13.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can reasonably be prevented only by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold or delay its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 22(1) has effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) If at any time prior to the commencement of regular revenue-earning operations comprised in the authorised development and notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing or commissioning of the authorised development causes EMI, then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of the EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing the EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy the EMI by way of modification to the source of the EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of the EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of the EMI; and

(10) For the purpose of paragraph 27(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph are deemed to be protective works referred to in that sub-paragraph.
(11) In relation to any dispute arising under this paragraph, the reference in article 48 (arbitration) to the Secretary of State must be read as a reference to the President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology.
29.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.
30.  The undertaker must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Network Rail unless it has first consulted Network Rail, and it must comply with Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.

Any additional expenses which Network Rail may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work must, provided that at least 56 days’ prior notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the undertaker, be paid by the undertaker to Network Rail.
32.—(1) The undertaker must pay to Network Rail all reasonable and proper costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part (but subject to the provisions of this paragraph and article 47 (no double recovery)) which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Network Rail by reason of—
(a)
the construction or maintenance of a specified work or the failure of such a work; or
(b)
any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged upon a specified work,
and the undertaker must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or any such failure, act or omission and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the supervision of the engineer will not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under this sub-paragraph.

80.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to the statutory undertaker on demand following submission of a claim in writing from the statutory undertaker all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by the statutory undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by the statutory undertaker in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by the statutory undertaker as a consequence of the statutory undertaker—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 77(3) if it elects to do so; and/or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting the statutory undertaker;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works; and
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 85 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the statutory undertaker by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the statutory undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
81.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of the statutory undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by the statutory undertaker, or the statutory undertaker becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by the statutory undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify the statutory undertaker for any other properly incurred expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs reasonably incurred by or recovered from the statutory undertaker, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or the statutory undertaker becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of the statutory undertaker.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by the statutory undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by the statutory undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of the statutory undertaker or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless the statutory undertaker fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) will impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or wilful act or default of the statutory undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any authorised works and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by the statutory undertaker as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 8 (consent to transfer benefit of order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph 3(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 81.
(4) The statutory undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, to be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) The statutory undertaker must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) The statutory undertaker must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within the statutory undertaker’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of the statutory undertaker’s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker, the statutory undertaker must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
(7) Save where the undertaker is Esso Petroleum Company Limited, or a group company of sufficient covenant strength to self-insure, the undertaker must not commence construction (and must not permit the commencement of such construction) of the authorised works on any land owned by the statutory undertaker or in respect of which the statutory undertaker has an easement or wayleave for its apparatus or any other interest or to carry out any works within 15 metres in any direction of the statutory undertaker’s apparatus unless and until the statutory undertaker is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to the statutory undertaker that it will maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and the statutory undertaker has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker (such confirmation not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Enactments and agreements
82.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between the statutory undertaker and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule will affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and the statutory undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
83.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or an undertaker requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 77(2) or (3) or an undertaker makes requirements for modifications to the undertaker’s works or for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 79 (retained apparatus: protection) or the statutory undertaker is required to access its apparatus in temporarily stopped up streets under paragraph 74, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works—
(a)
in the interests of safety;
(b)
taking into account the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development; and
(c)
taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the statutory undertaker’s undertaking,
and the statutory undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever the undertakers or statutory undertaker’s consent, agreement, approval or expression of satisfaction is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or statutory undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker or statutory undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
84.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 76(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable the statutory undertaker to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
85.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 79 (retained apparatus: protection) any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and the statutory undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the statutory undertaker, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
Notices
86.  The plans submitted to the statutory undertaker by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 79(1) must be sent to National Grid Plant Protection at plantprotection@nationalgrid.com or such other address as the statutory undertaker may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker.

(a)
retain any notice of SSE’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land; and
(b)
(where no such notice of SSE’s easement, right or other interest exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register) include (with its application to register title to the undertaker’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry) a notice of SSE’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land; and
(c)
provide up to date official entry copies to SSE within 20 working days of receipt of such up to date official entry copies.
Removal of apparatus
93.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order or under an agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 92 or in any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that SSE’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of SSE to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and the rights and facilities referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of SSE and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to SSE advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order SSE reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to SSE to its reasonable satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 94(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SSE in respect of the apparatus);
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SSE in respect of the apparatus); and
(c)
to allow access to that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SSE in respect of the apparatus).
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, SSE must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation will only extend to the requirement for SSE to use its compulsory purchase powers if SSE in its absolute discretion elects to do so.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between SSE and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 102 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule.
(5) SSE must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to SSE of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3) have been afforded to SSE to its satisfaction, then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
94.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for SSE facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and SSE and must be no less favourable on the whole to SSE than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by SSE.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with SSE under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are materially less favourable on the whole to SSE than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed (in SSE’s reasonable opinion) then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 102 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to SSE as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of SSE
95.—(1) Not less than 14 days before beginning any low risk works (which in each case does not take place more than 300mm below the surface of the ground, and in respect of the diversion or laying of services, excluding apparatus) the undertaker must submit to SSE a plan identifying the nature of the works and the planned interaction with apparatus and the undertaker will undertake those works in accordance with the requirements of HSE’s guidance notes: “HS G47 – Avoiding Danger from underground services” and “GS6 Avoiding danger from overhead power lines”.

(9) If SSE in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 90 and 91 and 93 to 95 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 93(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to SSE notice as soon as is reasonably practicable a plan of those works and must—
(a)
comply with conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (5)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
comply with sub-paragraph (12) at all times.
(12) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event, the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme.
Expenses
97.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to SSE on demand, following receipt of an invoiced demand (including where necessary anticipated disbursements) all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by SSE in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or rights or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by SSE in connection with the negotiation or acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including reasonable professional fees) incurred by SSE as a consequence of SSE;
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 93(3) if it elects to do so; and/or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting SSE;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule;
(g)
any watching brief pursuant to paragraph 95(7) or paragraph 96(7).
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to SSE by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible or appropriate in the circumstances (including due to statutory or regulatory changes) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to SSE in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on SSE any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
98.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of SSE, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by SSE, or SSE becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost properly incurred by SSE in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify SSE for any other properly incurred expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty (but not criminal penalties, unless such criminal penalties are directly attributable to the undertaker or any person authorised or employed by him) or costs properly incurred by or recovered from SSE, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or SSE becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of SSE.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by SSE on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by SSE or in accordance with any requirement of SSE or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless SSE fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) will impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or wilful act or default of SSE, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any authorised works and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by SSE as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 8 (consent to transfer benefit of order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph (3)(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph.
(4) SSE must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand.
(5) No settlement, or compromise or admission which might be prejudicial must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first obtaining the undertaker’s agreement and if the undertaking acting reasonably does not agree SSE and the undertaker will acting jointly, proceed to manage any settlement negotiations and or any litigation which may arise from the third party claim or demand.
Enactments and agreements
99.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between SSE and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule will affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and SSE in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
100.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or SSE requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 93(2) or 93(3) or SSE makes requirements for modifications to the undertaker’s works or for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 95 or SSE needs to access its apparatus in stopped up streets under paragraph 90, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works:
(a)
in the interests of safety;
(b)
taking into account the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development; and
(c)
taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of SSE’s undertaking,
and SSE must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever SSE’s consent, agreement, approval or expression of satisfaction is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by SSE or the taking of action by SSE, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
101.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 92(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SSE in respect of the apparatus) is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable SSE to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction and both parties must use their best endeavours to co-operate for that purpose.
Arbitration
102.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraphs 98(5) and paragraph 95 any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and SSE under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and SSE, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
Notices
103.  The plans submitted to SSE by the undertaker pursuant to paragraphs 95(1) and 96(1) must be sent to SSE at their registered or such other address as SSE may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker.

(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between SGN and the undertaker) that are subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement and/or other legal or land interest of SGN and/or affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between SGN and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as SGN reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent and variations upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between SGN and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to SGN unless otherwise agreed by SGN.
(3) The undertaker and SGN agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation and/or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation and/or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by SGN and/or other enactments relied upon by SGN as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule will prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by SGN under paragraph 112 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, will not be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1) that involves de-commissioned apparatus being left in situ in any land of the undertaker, the undertaker must accept a surrender of any existing easement and/or other interest of SGN in such decommissioned apparatus and consequently acquire title to such decommissioned apparatus and release SGN from all liabilities in respect of such de-commissioned apparatus from the date of such surrender.

(a)
retain any notice of SGN’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land; and
(b)
(where no such notice of SGN’s easement, right or other interest exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register) include (with its application to register title to the undertaker’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry) a notice of SGN’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land; and
(c)
provide up to date official entry copies to SGN within 20 working days of receipt of such up to date official entry copies.
Removal of apparatus
110.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order or under an agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 109 or in any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that SGN’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of SGN to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and the rights and facilities referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of SGN and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to SGN advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order SGN reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to SGN to its reasonable satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 111(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus);
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus); and
(c)
to allow access to that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus).
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, SGN must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation will only extend to the requirement for SGN to use its compulsory purchase powers if SGN in its absolute discretion elects to do so.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between SGN and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance paragraph 118 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule.
(5) SGN must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to SGN of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) have been afforded to SGN to its satisfaction, then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
111.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for SGN facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and SGN and must be no less favourable on the whole to SGN than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by SGN.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with SGN under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are materially less favourable on the whole to SGN than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed (in ‘reasonable opinion) then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 118 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to SGN as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of SGN
112.—(1) Not less than 14 days before beginning any low risk works (which in each case does not take place more than 900mm below the surface of the ground, and in respect of the diversion or laying of services, excluding apparatus) the undertaker must submit to SGN a plan identifying the nature of the works and the planned interaction with apparatus and the undertaker will undertake those works in accordance with the requirements of SGN’s publication SGN/WI/SW/2 “Work Instruction for Safe Working in the Vicinity of Pipelines & Associated Installations operating >7barg”.
(2) Save where sub-paragraph (1) applies, not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to SGN a plan and, if reasonably required by SGN, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(3) The plan to be submitted to SGN under sub-paragraph (2) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc.;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(4) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) apply until SGN has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(5) Any approval of SGN required under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (6) or (8); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (2) and/or (3) apply, SGN may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and no less convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) or as relevant sub-paragraph (6), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and SGN and in accordance with all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (5)(a), and SGN will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where SGN reasonably requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to ‘reasonable satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required.
(9) Any requirements made by SGN under sub-paragraph (8) must be made within a period of 42 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (2) is submitted to it.
(10) If SGN, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 104 to 106 and 109 to 111 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 110(2).
(11) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 14 days (in respect of low risk works) or otherwise 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(12) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (2) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to SGN notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with—
(a)
the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (5)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
sub-paragraph (13) at all times.
(13) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that SGN retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 113.
Expenses
113.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to SGN following receipt of an invoiced demand (including where necessary anticipated disbursements) all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by SGN in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or rights or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by SGN in connection with the negotiation or acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including reasonable professional fees) incurred by SGN as a consequence of SGN;
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 110(3) if it elects to do so; and/or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting SGN;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;

(g)
any watching brief pursuant to sub-paragraph 112(7).
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to SGN by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible or appropriate in the circumstances (including due to statutory or regulatory changes) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
114.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of SGN, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by SGN, or SGN becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost properly incurred by SGN in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify SGN for any other properly incurred expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty (but not criminal penalties, unless such criminal penalties are directly attributable to the undertaker or any person authorised or employed by him) or costs properly incurred by or recovered from SGN, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or SGN becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of SGN.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by SGN on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by SGN or in accordance with any requirement of SGN or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless SGN fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) will impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or wilful act or default of SGN, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any authorised works and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by SGN as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 8 (consent to transfer benefit of order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph (3)(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 114.
(4) SGN must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand.
(5) No settlement, or compromise or admission which might be prejudicial must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first obtaining the undertaker’s agreement and if the undertaking acting reasonably does not agree SGN and the undertaker will acting jointly, proceed to manage any settlement negotiations and/or any litigation which may arise from the third party claim or demand.
Enactments and agreements
115.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between SGN and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule will affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and SGN in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
116.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or SGN requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 110(2) or SGN makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 112 or SGN needs to access its apparatus in stopped up streets under paragraph 107, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works—
(a)
in the interests of safety;
(b)
taking into account the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development; and
(c)
taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of SGN’s undertaking,
and SGN must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever SGN’s consent, agreement, approval or expression of satisfaction is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
117.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 109(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus) is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable SGN to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction and both parties must use their best endeavours to co-operate for that purpose.
Arbitration
118.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraphs 112 and 114(5) any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and SGN under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and SGN, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
Notices
119.  The plans submitted to SGN by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 112 must be sent to SGN at easements@sgn.co.uk or such other address as SGN may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker.

(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus);
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus); and
(c)
to allow access to that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus).
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights within the order limits as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent may, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 134 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3) have been afforded to Cadent to its satisfaction, then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
127.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed (in Cadent’s reasonable opinion) then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 134 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of Cadent
128.—(1) Not less than 14 days before beginning any low risk works the undertaker must submit to Cadent a plan identifying the nature of the works and the planned interaction with apparatus and the undertaker will undertake those works in accordance with the requirements of sub-paragraph (12) of this paragraph and no work will be undertaken in the vicinity of the apparatus without the formal written consent of Cadent in accordance with paragraph 2 of Cadent’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “Specification for safe working in the vicinity of Cadent assets for third parties SSW22”.
(2) Save where sub-paragraph (1) applies in respect of low risk works, not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to Cadent a plan and, if reasonably required by Cadent, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.

(5) Any approval of Cadent required under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (6) or (8); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (2) and/or (3) apply, Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and no less convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) or as relevant sub-paragraph (6), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent and in accordance with all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (5)(a), and Cadent will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where Cadent reasonably requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent’s reasonable satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(9) If Cadent, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 120 to 122 and 125 to 127 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 126(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 14 days (in respect of low risk works) or otherwise 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with—

the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (5)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
sub-paragraph (12) at all times.
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order the undertaker must comply with the Cadent’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “Specification for safe working in the vicinity of Cadent assets requirements for third parties SSW22” and HSE’s “HS(~G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
(13) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 129.
(14) The undertaker must not commence (and must not permit the commencement of) the authorised works or any intrusive environmental (including archaeological) surveys and investigation or intrusive site or soil survey, on any land owned by Cadent or in respect of which Cadent has an easement or wayleave for its apparatus or any other interest or to carry out any works within 15 metres in any direction of Cadent’s apparatus unless and until Cadent is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to Cadent that it will maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of the authorised works) and Cadent has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker (such confirmation not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Expenses
129.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Cadent on demand, following receipt of an invoice from Cadent all charges, costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Cadent in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by Cadent in connection with the negotiation or acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including reasonable professional fees) incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent;

using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under sub-paragraph 126(3) if it elects to do so; and/or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;

(g)
any watching brief pursuant to paragraph 128(7).
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible or appropriate in the circumstances (including due to statutory or regulatory changes) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and

where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
130.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other reasonable expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty (but not criminal penalties, unless such criminal penalties are directly attributable to the undertaker) or costs reasonably incurred by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Cadent becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) will impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or wilful act or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any authorised works and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by Cadent as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 8 (consent to transfer benefit of order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph 3(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 130.
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the promoter and considering and discussing their representations and must keep the undertaker updated on the settlement negotiation and/or any litigation which may arise from it and take such action as the undertaker may reasonably request to avoid, dispute, compromise or defend the matter.

131.—(1) Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between Cadent and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule will affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Cadent in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
(2) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule will affect the provisions of an agreement dated 18 September 1985 between the undertaker (a) and (2) British Gas Corporation (2).
(3) The benefit and burden of that agreement on the part of British Gas Corporation now vests in Cadent, insofar as it affects Cadent’s 8 inch gas main referred to in the agreement.
Co-operation
132.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or Cadent requires the removal of apparatus under sub-paragraph 126(2) or (3) or Cadent makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 128 or Cadent is required to access its apparatus in stopped up streets under paragraph 123, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works—
(a)
in the interests of safety;
(b)
taking into account the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development; and
(c)
taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Cadent’s undertaking,
and Cadent must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever Cadent’s consent, agreement, approval or expression of satisfaction is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
133.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 125(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus) is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable Cadent to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction and both parties must use their best endeavours to co-operate for that purpose.
Arbitration
134.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 128 any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and Cadent under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Cadent, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
Notices
135.  The plans submitted to Cadent by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 128 must be sent to Cadent Gas Limited Plant Protection at Brick Kiln Street, Hinckley, Leicestershire LE10 0NA or such other address as Cadent may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker.

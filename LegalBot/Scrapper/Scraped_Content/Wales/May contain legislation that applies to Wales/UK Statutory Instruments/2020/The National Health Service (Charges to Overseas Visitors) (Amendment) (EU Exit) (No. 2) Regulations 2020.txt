(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/238) (“the Principal Regulations”) which provide for the making and recovery of charges for relevant services provided under the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41) to certain persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.
Regulation 3 inserts regulation 12A into the Principal Regulations to provide that persons who are in scope of the SSC Protocol provisions of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement are able to receive relevant services without charge where there is a right arising from the agreement.
Regulation 4 inserts Ireland and Norway into the list of countries in Schedule 2 to the Principal Regulations, meaning that no charges may be made or recovered in respect of relevant services provided to an overseas visitor where the provision of those services is covered by that reciprocal agreement.

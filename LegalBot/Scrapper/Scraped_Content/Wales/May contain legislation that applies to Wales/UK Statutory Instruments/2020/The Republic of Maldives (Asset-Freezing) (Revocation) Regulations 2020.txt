(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Republic of Maldives (Asset-Freezing) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/861) as the EU Regulation on which they are based has been repealed.
The Republic of Maldives (Asset-Freezing) Regulations 2018 implemented in the United Kingdom Council Regulation (EU) 2018/1001 (OJ L 180, 17.7.2018, p.1), which concerned restrictive measures in view of the situation in the Republic of Maldives.
Council Regulation (EU) 2019/985 (OJ L 160, 18.6.2019, p.1) repealed Council Regulation (EU) 2018/1001, meaning that the UK implementing Regulations may now be revoked.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

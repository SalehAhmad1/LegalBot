28th September 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 122(3) of the Localism Act 2011 (c.20) (“the 2011 Act”) provides that sub-sections (1) and (2), which made amendments to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (c. 8) (“the 1990 Act”), cease to have effect at the end of 7 years beginning with the day on which the inserted section 61W(1) of the 1990 Act comes fully into force. The amendments inserted new provisions requiring prospective developers to consult local communities before submitting planning applications for certain developments. The inserted section 61W(1) of the 1990 Act came fully into force on 17th December 2013 in accordance with article 2 of the Localism Act 2011 (Commencement No. 3) Order (S.I. 2013/2931), so the provisions would cease to have effect on 16th December 2020, unless an order is made under section 122(4) of the 2011 Act. This Order is made under that provision, so the provisions inserted by subsections (1) and (2) of section 122 of the 2011 Act cease to have on 15th December 2025.

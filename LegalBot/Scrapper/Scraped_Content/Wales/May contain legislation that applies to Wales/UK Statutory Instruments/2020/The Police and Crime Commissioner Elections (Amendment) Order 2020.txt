27th February 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Police and Crime Commissioner Elections Order 2012 (“the 2012 Order”).
The 2012 Order sets out certain requirements in relation to “election expenses”, as defined in article 50 of that Order. Part 2 of Schedule 7 to the 2012 Order sets out a list of matters which are excluded from being election expenses within the meaning of article 50. Article 2(3) of this Order adds to that list of matters reasonably incurred expenditure by or on behalf of a disabled candidate that is reasonably attributable to the candidate’s disability.
Article 3 provides for the amendment of election forms specified in the 2012 Order in relation to a police area where, pursuant to an order made under section 4A of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, the police and crime commissioner is also the fire and rescue authority for that area. The effect of these amendments is that, on the specified election forms, references to the police and crime commissioner are replaced by references to the police, fire and crime commissioner save for the reference in Form 7 that is referred to in article 3(2)(b). That reference is amended by article 2(4) so that the declaration by a candidate that the candidate is not nominated for election for any other police area covers all other police areas.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

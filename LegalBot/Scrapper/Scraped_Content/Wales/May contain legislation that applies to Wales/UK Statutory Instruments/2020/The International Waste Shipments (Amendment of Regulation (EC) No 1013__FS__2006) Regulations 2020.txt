7th December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement changes to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (adopted on 22nd March 1989)(1).
In May 2019, the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention adopted decision BC-14/12 by which it amended Annexes II, VIII and IX to the Convention in relation to plastic waste(2).
Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 as it forms part of domestic law on and after IP completion day (see section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16)), which implements the Basel Convention in respect of the United Kingdom, is amended by these Regulations as follows:
Annex IC is amended by regulation 4 to remove a defunct reference to plastic waste classified as B3010, which is no longer a classification used in the Basel Convention, and to include a reference to plastic wastes classified as Y48, which has been added to Annex II to that Convention.
Annex III is amended by regulation 5 to remove defunct references to plastic wastes classified as B3010 and GH013, which are also no longer classifications used in the Basel Convention.
Annex IIIA is amended by regulation 6 to remove defunct references to plastic wastes classified as B3010.
Annex IV is amended by regulation 7 to add plastic wastes classified as:
(a)
AC300, which is the OECD Decision equivalent of classification A3210 which has been added to Annex VIII to the Basel Convention, and
(b)
Y48, which has been added to Annex II to the Basel Convention.
Annex V is amended by regulation 8 to add plastic wastes classified as A3210 and B3011, which have been added to Annexes VIII and II to the Basel Convention respectively.

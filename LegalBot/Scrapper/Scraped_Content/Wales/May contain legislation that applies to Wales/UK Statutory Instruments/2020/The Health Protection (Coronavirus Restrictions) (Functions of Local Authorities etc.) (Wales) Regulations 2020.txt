The Welsh Ministers make the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 45C(1) and (3)(c), 45F(2) and 45P of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 M1.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wales.
The Welsh Ministers consider that the restrictions and requirements imposed by these Regulations are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with section 45R of that Act the Welsh Ministers are of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, Senedd Cymru.

First Minister, one of the Welsh MinistersEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2A of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 enables the Welsh Ministers, by regulations, to make provision for the purpose of preventing, protecting against, controlling or providing a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection or contamination in Wales.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wales.
The Regulations have 5 Parts.
Part 1 contains interpretation provisions. It also provides that the Regulations expire on 8 January 2021 unless they are revoked before then.
Part 2 provides local authorities in Wales with powers to control premises, events and public places in their areas to help control coronavirus within their areas. This includes closing premises and public places and stopping events where necessary.
Part 3 continues a duty already imposed on local authorities, National Park authorities, Natural Resources Wales and the National Trust to close public footpaths and land accessible by the public in Wales where congregation of people may lead to a high risk of exposure to coronavirus.
Part 4 provides for the enforcement of the restrictions or requirements imposed by the Regulations.
Part 5 revokes the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (Functions of Local Authorities) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/984 (W. 221)) and makes a consequential amendment to the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 2) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/725 (W. 162)). The Regulations replace the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (Functions of Local Authorities) (Wales) Regulations 2020 due to a failure to properly record the Welsh Ministers' declaration that the Regulations were urgent, in accordance with section 45R(2) of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely cost and benefit of complying with these Regulations.

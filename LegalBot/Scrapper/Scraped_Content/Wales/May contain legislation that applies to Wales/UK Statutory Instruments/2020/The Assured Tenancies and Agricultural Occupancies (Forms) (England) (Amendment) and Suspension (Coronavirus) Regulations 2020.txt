SCHEDULE
Form No. 6AEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 21(8) of the Housing Act 1988 (c. 50) gives the Secretary of State power to prescribe a form of a notice under section 21(1) or (4) given in relation to an assured shorthold tenancy of a dwelling-house in England. This is a notice of intention to seek possession of a property let on an assured shorthold tenancy.
The relevant form (“Form 6A”) is prescribed in the Assured Tenancies and Agricultural Occupancies (Forms) (England) Regulations 2015 (the Principal Regulations).
Paragraph 12(2) of Schedule 29 to the Coronavirus Act 2020 (c. 7) modifies Form 6A during the relevant period which began on 26th March 2020 and ends on 31st March 2021. The relevant period in paragraph 1 of Schedule 29 to the Coronavirus Act 2020 was extended, in relation to England, by the Coronavirus Act 2020 (Residential Tenancies: Protection from Eviction) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/914).
These Regulations suspend paragraph 12(2) of Schedule 29 and prescribe a new Form 6A by amending the Schedule to the Principal Regulations. They are made to reflect the amendments to the required period of notice of intention to seek possession of a property let on an assured shorthold tenancy and the period of validity of such a notice made by S.I. 2020/914.

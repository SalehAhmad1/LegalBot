16th January 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the following Regulations (“the Inspection Regulations”)—
(a)
the Inspection of Education and Training (Wales) Regulations 2001,
(b)
the Education (School Inspection) (Wales) Regulations 2006,
(c)
the Inspection of Careers and Related Services (Wales) Regulations 2006, and
(d)
the Education (Inspection of Nursery Education) (Wales) Regulations 2015.
Currently the Inspection Regulations require Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education and Training in Wales or Prif Arolygydd Ei Mawrhydi dros Addysg a Hyfforddiant yng Nghymru to carry out an inspection at least once within the 7 year period beginning on 1 September 2016 and ending on 31 August 2023 (“the First Inspection Period”) and at least once within every subsequent 6 year inspection period.
These Regulations amend the First Inspection Period in each of the Inspection Regulations so that it will end on 31 August 2024 instead of 31 August 2023. All subsequent inspections will continue to be once in every 6 year inspection period.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

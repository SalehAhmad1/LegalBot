(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to and revocations of legislation in the field of official controls and other official activities performed by the authorities to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products. Part 2 amends subordinate UK legislation, Part 3 amends retained direct EU legislation and Part 4 revokes retained direct EU legislation.
Part 5 makes a general transitional provision relating to the presentation or other use of model certificates on or after IP completion day in connection with the importation into, or movement through or from, Great Britain, of goods, or the inspection and placing on the market of goods in Great Britain, or the slaughter of animals in Great Britain. It also provides transitional arrangements for model certificates for animals and related products, including products of animal origin.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

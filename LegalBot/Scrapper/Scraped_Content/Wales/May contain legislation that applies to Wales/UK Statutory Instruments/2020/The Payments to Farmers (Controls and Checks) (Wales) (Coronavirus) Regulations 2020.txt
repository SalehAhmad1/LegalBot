21 May 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 modifies Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 809/2014 (“Regulation 809/2014”) laying down rules for the application of Regulation (EU) No. 1306/2013 with regard to the integrated administration and control system, rural development measures and cross compliance for claim year 2020.
Regulation 809/2014 lays down rules on the timing of on-the-spot checks, the control rates of certain on-the-spot checks within the integrated system including for area-related aid schemes, and the increase or reduction of the control rates. In addition, Regulation 809/2014 contains rules on on-the-spot checks relating to eligibility criteria, and commitments.
Several obligations pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 1306/2013 and Regulation (EU) No. 1307/2013 rely on specific and different time frames for their fulfilment, and consequently require the on-the-spot checks to be carried out within those time frames. The measures in place to address the COVID-19 pandemic affects the feasibility of performing the required on-the-spot checks accurately and within the corresponding time limits.
Regulation 2 provides for derogations from those requirements and reduces the minimum rate of the on-the-spot checks compared to the normal control rates for Greening, cross-compliance, Basic Payment Scheme, redistributive and young farmer obligations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

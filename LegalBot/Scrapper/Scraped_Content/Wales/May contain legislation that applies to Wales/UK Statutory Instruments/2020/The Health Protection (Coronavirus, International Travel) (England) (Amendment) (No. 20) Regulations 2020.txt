remove Liechtenstein from, and add the Canary Islands, Denmark, Maldives, and the Greek island of Mykonos to, the list of exempt countries and territories, in Schedule A1 to the principal Regulations, from which passengers arriving in England are not required to self-isolate (regulation 2(2));
(b)
amend the passenger information, in Schedule 1 to the principal Regulations, which passengers arriving in England must provide (regulation 2(3));

(d)
amend the list of specified competitions in Schedule 3 to the principal Regulations, which is relevant to the exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for elite sportspersons (regulation 2(5)).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the power conferred by section 41(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c.1) (“the Act”).
These Regulations amend the Challenges to Validity of EU Instruments (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/673) (“the Principal Regulations”).
The Principal Regulations will come into force on IP completion day by operation of paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the Act.
Regulation 2 amends regulations 3 and 4 of the Principal Regulations by substituting “IP completion day” for “exit day” in consequence of the Act. These amendments ensure that regulation 3 and regulation 4 of the Principal Regulations operate by reference to IP completion day, rather than exit day.

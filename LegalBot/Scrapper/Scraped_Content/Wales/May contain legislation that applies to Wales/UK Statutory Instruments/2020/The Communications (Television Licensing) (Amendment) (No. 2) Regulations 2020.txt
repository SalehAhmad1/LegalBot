11th February 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/692) to make provision for a form of TV licence to be known as a “simple payment plan licence (not black and white only)” (a “simple payment licence”). The 2004 Regulations were amended by the Communications (Television Licensing) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2018 (SI 2018/339) to trial these types of licence, on a temporary basis, permitting the TV licence fee to be paid for in evenly spread monthly or fortnightly instalments, in specified circumstances.
These Regulations bring the temporary scheme into ongoing operation by removing the provisions which time limit the temporary scheme (regulation 4(b)). These Regulations also make some changes to the conditions of the scheme. For example the definition of a “debt advice charity” has been widened (regulation 4(e)). In addition, a new “Circumstance D” has been included for the issue of a simple payment licence to those who have held one in the 12 months before the issue date of the new licence (regulations 4(b) and (d)). The scheme has also been amended to take account of the new licence fee of £157.50 applicable from 1st April 2020. The regulations allow for the duration of the licence to be shortened to reflect the fact that it has been purchased on any date later than the due date. This allows the duration of the licences to be set to ensure that all periods of licensable activity are paid for.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as there will be no impact on the private sector and negligible impact on the voluntary sectors is foreseen.

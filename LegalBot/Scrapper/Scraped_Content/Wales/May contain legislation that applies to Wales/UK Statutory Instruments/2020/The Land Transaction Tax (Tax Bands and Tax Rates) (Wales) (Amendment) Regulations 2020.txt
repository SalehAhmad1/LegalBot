At 10.20 a.m. on 21 December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Land Transaction Tax (Tax Bands and Tax Rates) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/128) (“the 2018 Regulations”) so as to insert revised tax bands and percentage tax rates for higher rates residential property transactions, non-residential property transactions and chargeable consideration which consists of rent.
Regulation 3 applies the revised tax bands and percentage tax rates to the aforementioned land transactions where the effective date of the transaction falls on or after 22 December 2020.
Regulation 4 goes on to set out exceptions to the general application of the revised tax bands and percentage tax rates in respect of higher rates residential property transactions only. Where the effective date for such transactions falls on or after 22 December 2020, but where contracts were exchanged or the substantial performance of that contract took place prior to 22 December 2020, the previous tax bands and percentage tax rates will continue to apply, unless one of the exclusions set out in regulation 5 applies.
Regulation 6 sets out the revised tax bands and percentage tax rates that are to apply to the transactions specified in regulation 3.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a Regulatory Impact Assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Order)
In England and Northern Ireland, only “designated” Ministers and departments can exercise powers in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c.68) to make orders, rules, regulations or schemes. This is one of a series of Orders by which Ministers and departments are designated for the purposes of section 2(2) in relation to different subject areas.
The European Communities Act 1972 was repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) on exit day but its effect, including the power in section 2(2), was saved and modified by section 1A of that Act to give effect to the continued application of EU law during the transition period.
Article 3 designates the Secretary of State in relation to measures relating to the access to, or the pursuit of a regulated profession.

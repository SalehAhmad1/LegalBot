(This note is not part of the Order)
Part 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) makes provision about proscribed organisations (including setting out offences in relation to such organisations in sections 11 to 13). An organisation is proscribed if it is listed in Schedule 2 to that Act or, as in most cases, if it operates under the same name as an organisation so listed (section 3(1)).
Section 3(6) of that Act enables the Secretary of State, by order, to provide that a name that is not specified in Schedule 2 to that Act is to be treated as another name for an organisation that is listed in that Schedule. Article 2 of this Order specifies System Resistance Network as another name for the organisation listed as National Action.

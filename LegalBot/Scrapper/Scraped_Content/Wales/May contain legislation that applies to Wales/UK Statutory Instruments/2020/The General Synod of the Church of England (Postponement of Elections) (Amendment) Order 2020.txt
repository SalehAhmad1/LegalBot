Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under section 84 of the Coronavirus Act 2020.
This Order amends the first Order made under that section, the General Synod of the Church of England (Postponement of Elections) Order 2020 (S.I. 2020/526), by inserting a new Article 4 to make consequential provision about the membership of the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England.
Under paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 to the Care of Cathedrals Measure 2011, membership of the Commission is for a fixed term of five years, which is expressed to begin on the 1st May in the year following that in which the General Synod was last dissolved. Accordingly, the term of office of each current member of the Commission is due to expire on 30th April 2021, before the General Synod will have been dissolved.
The new Article 4 resolves that issue by providing for each person’s membership of the Commission to continue until the 30th April in the year following that in which the next dissolution of the General Synod takes place (unless any particular person ceases to be a member of the Commission for some other reason before that date).

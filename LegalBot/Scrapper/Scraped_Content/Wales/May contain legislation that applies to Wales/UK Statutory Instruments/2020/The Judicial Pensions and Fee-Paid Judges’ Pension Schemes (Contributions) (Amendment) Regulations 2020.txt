(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Judicial Pensions Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/182) (“the 2015 Regulations”) and the Judicial Pensions (Fee-Paid Judges) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/522) make provision for the contributions payable by members of both schemes constituted by those Regulations.
These Regulations provide that the contribution rates currently applicable for both schemes are to continue to apply from 1st April 2020 onwards. New earning thresholds (except for £150,001 and above) are set for those contribution rates from 1st April 2020 in line with the increase of the consumer prices index in September 2019 published by the Statistics Board. Those earning thresholds (except for £150,001 and above) will continue to uprate in April of each year in line with increases in the consumer prices index of the previous September.
Since these Regulations involve a change to a protected element of the scheme constituted by the 2015 Regulations, the Lord Chancellor has consulted representatives of those likely to be affected by the change with a view to reaching agreement with them and has laid a report before Parliament as required by section 22 of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25).
The executive function of the Statistics Board is known as the Office of National Statistics (ONS) and the monthly all items consumer prices index is available on its website at www.ons.gov.uk. The contact details for the ONS are as follows, address: Government Buildings, Cardiff Road, Newport, South Wales NP10 8XG and telephone number: 0845 601 3034.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

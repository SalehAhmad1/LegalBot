(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Plant Health etc. (Fees) (England) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/289) (the “2018 Regulations”) which specify fees payable to the Secretary of State in relation to plant health services and the certification of seed potatoes and fruit plants and fruit plant propagating material.
Regulation 2(2) inserts regulation 6A into the 2018 Regulations to provide for the fee payable by an importer of potatoes originating in Lebanon where an inspector samples a potato lot for the purposes of Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1614 authorising Member States to provide for derogations from certain provisions of Council Directive 2000/29/EC in respect of potatoes, other than potatoes intended for planting, originating in the regions of Akkar and Bekaa of Lebanon (OJ No L 250, 30.9.2019, p.85).
Regulation 2(3) substitutes Schedule 2 to the 2018 Regulations, which sets out reduced rate fees payable by the importer of a third country consignment for plant health checks in respect of certain plant and plant products which are subject to reduced levels of checks agreed under the procedure provided for in Articles 13a(2) and 18(2) of Council Directive 2000/29/EC on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (OJ No L 169, 10.7.2000, p.1). This regulation gives effect to the latest notification published by the European Commission of the reduced plant health checks which are applicable to certain plants and plant products (published on 19 November 2019).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact, or no significant impact, on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

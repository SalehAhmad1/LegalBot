INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING
The Reinforcement to the North Shropshire Electricity Distribution Network Order 2020
Made
20th March 2020
Coming into force
14th April 2020
An application has been made to the Secretary of State under section 37 of the Planning Act 2008 M1 (“the 2008 Act”) in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009 M2 for an Order granting development consent.
The application was examined by a single appointed person (appointed by the Secretary of State) in accordance with Chapters 3 and 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010 M3. The single appointed person, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn and the application together with the accompanying documents, in accordance with section 83 M4 of the 2008 Act, has submitted a report and recommendation to the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State, has considered the representations made and not withdrawn, the report and recommendation of the single appointed person, has taken into account the environmental information in accordance with regulation 3 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2009 M5 and has had regard to the documents and matters referred to in section 104(2) M6 of the 2008 Act.
The Secretary of State is satisfied that the special category land within the Order limits (as defined in article 28(3) of this Order), when burdened with any new rights authorised to be compulsorily acquired under this Order, will be no less advantageous than it was before to the persons in whom it is vested; other persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other rights; and the public; and that, accordingly, section 132(3) of the 2008 Act applies.
The Secretary of State, having decided the application, has determined to make an Order giving effect to the proposals comprised in the application on terms that in the opinion of the Secretary of State are not materially different from those proposed in the application.
Accordingly, the Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers in sections 114, 115 and 120 of the 2008 Act M7, makes the following Order:

(5) Section 11 of the 1965 Act (powers of entry) is modified to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restriction, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section, it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry) M4, 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date) M5, 12 (unauthorised entry) M6 and 13 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) M7 of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 M8 of the 1965 Act (of tenants at will, etc.) applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 of the 1965 Act (interests omitted from purchase) as modified by article 24(4) is also modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restriction imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 22 (application of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981) of The Reinforcement to the North Shropshire Electricity Distribution Network Order 2020 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 23 (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the Reinforcement to the North Shropshire Electricity Distribution Network Order 2020 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house, except where the context otherwise requires.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of twenty-eight days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.

(b)
the relevant planning authority does not give notice of its decision to the undertaker within the decision period specified in paragraph 1;
(c)
on receipt of a request for further information under paragraph 2 the undertaker considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the relevant planning authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or
(d)
on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant planning authority notifies the undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the application.
(2) The appeal process is as follows—
(a)
any appeal by the undertaker must be made within 42 days of the date of the notice of the decision or determination, or (where no determination has been made) expiry of the decision period as determined under paragraph 1;
(b)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning authority and the requirement consultees;
(c)
as soon as is practicable after receiving the appeal documentation, the Secretary of State must appoint a person to determine the appeal (“the appointed person”) and must notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for that person's attention should be sent;
(d)
the relevant planning authority and the requirement consultees must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within 20 business days of the date on which the appeal parties are notified of the appointment of a person under paragraph (c) and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person; and
(e)
the appeal parties must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within 20 business days of receipt of written representations under sub-paragraph (2) (d).
(3) The appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) (c) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(4) If the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable consideration of the appeal the appointed person must, as soon as practicable, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required, the appeal party from whom the information is sought, and the date by which the information is to be submitted.
(5) Any further information required under sub-paragraph (4) is to be provided by the party from whom the information is sought to the appointed person and to other appeal parties by the date specified by the appointed person. Any written representations concerning matters contained in the further information must be submitted to the appointed person and made available to all appeal parties within 10 business days of that date.

(10) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the appeal parties, and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(11) If an approval is given by the appointed person under this Schedule, it is deemed to be an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 (requirements) as if it had been given by the relevant planning authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person's determination.
(12) Except where a direction is given under sub-paragraph (13) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person are to be met by the undertaker.
(13) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to the Planning Practice Guidance on appeals published on 3 March 2014 from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

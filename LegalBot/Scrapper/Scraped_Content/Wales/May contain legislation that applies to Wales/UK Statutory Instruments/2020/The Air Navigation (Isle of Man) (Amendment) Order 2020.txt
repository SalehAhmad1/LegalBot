Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Air Navigation (Isle of Man) Order 2015 makes provision for the Isle of Man in relation to the registration, marking, airworthiness, equipment, manning, operation, movement and safety of aircraft and the licensing and welfare of flight crew.
The Airports and Civil Aviation Act 1987 (an Act of Tynwald), as amended by the Airports and Civil Aviation (Amendment) Act 2018, now provides enabling powers so that the Isle of Man is able to make its own secondary legislation in relation to civil aviation.
This Order accordingly amends the Air Navigation (Isle of Man) Order 2015 by revoking various articles and making consequential amendments where required. Replacement provisions following this initial phase of revocations can be found in the Civil Aviation (Miscellaneous Provision) Order 2020 (SD 2020/0134), the Civil Aviation (Small Unmanned Aircraft) Order 2020 (SD 2020/0135), the Civil Aviation (Air Traffic Services) Order 2020 (SD 2020/0136), the Civil Aviation (Occurrence Reporting) Order 2020 (SD 2020/0137) and the Civil Aviation (Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air) Order 2020 (SD 2020/0138), the commencement dates of which coincide with the coming into force of this Order.

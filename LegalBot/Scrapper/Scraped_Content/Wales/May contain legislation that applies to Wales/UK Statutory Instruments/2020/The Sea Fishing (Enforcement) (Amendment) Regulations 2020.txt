SEA FISHERIES
CONSERVATION OF SEA FISH
The Sea Fishing (Enforcement) (Amendment) Regulations 2020
Made
15th May 2020
Laid before Parliament
19th May 2020
Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1
The Secretary of State makes these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of, and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(1) (“the 1972 Act”).
The Secretary of State is a Minister designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the 1972 Act in relation to the common agricultural policy(2).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the 1972 Act and it appears to the Secretary of State that it is expedient for the references to Article 10 of Council Regulation (EU) 2020/123 fixing for 2020 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters(3) to be construed as a reference to that Article as amended from time to time.

Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 was amended by section 27(1)(a) of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c. 51) and by section 3(3) of, and Part 1 of the Schedule to, the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c. 7).

Functions exercisable by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State acting jointly were transferred to the Secretary of State by S.I. 2002/794.

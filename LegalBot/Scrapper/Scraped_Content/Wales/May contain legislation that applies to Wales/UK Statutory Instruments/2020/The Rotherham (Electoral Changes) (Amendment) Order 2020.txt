(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Rotherham (Electoral Changes) Order 2018 (“the 2018 Order”) which gave effect to recommendations for changes to electoral arrangements for Rotherham, stated in the Local Government Boundary Commission Report of October 2017 (“the report”).
Table 2 in Schedule 2 to the 2018 Order provides that the number of councillors to be elected for the parish of Bramley (“the parish”) is seven. This provision was made in error in consequence of a mistake in the report; this Order corrects that error and provides that the number of councillors to be elected for the parish is 13. This Order is being issued free of charge to all known recipients of the 2018 Order.
The area of the parish and its wards are not affected by this Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

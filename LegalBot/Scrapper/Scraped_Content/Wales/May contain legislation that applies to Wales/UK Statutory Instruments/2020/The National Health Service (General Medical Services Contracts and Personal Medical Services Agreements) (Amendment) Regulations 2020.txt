(d)
to require contractors to offer their registered patients the facility to access online their prospective medical records, as well as their coded records, and, if requested by patients, to offer the facility to access online their full historical medical records (see paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 4 of Schedule 2);
(e)
to require contractors to have an online presence (such as a website) and keep that profile up to date, as well as keeping their profile on the NHS website up to date (see paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 5 of Schedule 2).
These Regulations make also make various consequential amendments (see paragraphs 7 to 10 and 13 of Schedule 1 and paragraphs 6 to 9 and 11 of Schedule 2).
The Regulations also make minor amendments to update contact details in regulation 74F of the GMS Contracts Regulations and regulation 67F of the PMS Agreements Regulations and to update paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the GMS Contracts Regulations so that it refers to the most recent edition of “Health for all Children” by Alan Emond (a revised fifth edition was published by OUP on 28th February 2019) (see paragraphs 11 and 12 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 to these Regulations).

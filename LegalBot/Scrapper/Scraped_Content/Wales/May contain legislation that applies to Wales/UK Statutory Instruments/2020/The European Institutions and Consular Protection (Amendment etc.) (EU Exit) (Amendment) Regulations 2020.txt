3rd December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations amend the European Institutions and Consular Protection (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1391). These Regulations amend references to “exit day” in the 2018 Regulations to “IP completion day”. These Regulations also omit certain regulations in the 2018 Regulations which are redundant as a result of provisions in the Withdrawal Agreement (which is the agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union which sets out the arrangements for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (as that agreement is modified from time to time in accordance with any provision of it)).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

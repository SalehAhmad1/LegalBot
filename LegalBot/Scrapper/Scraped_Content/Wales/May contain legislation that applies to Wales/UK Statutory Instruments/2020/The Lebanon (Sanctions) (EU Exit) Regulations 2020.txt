Minister of State
Foreign and Commonwealth OfficeEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) to establish a sanctions regime in relation to Lebanon for the purposes of compliance with the United Kingdom's United Nations obligations under resolution 1701 (2006). Following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, these Regulations also replace the European Union sanctions regime in respect of Lebanon, implemented via an EU Council Decision and Regulation.
The Regulations impose trade restrictions on military goods and technology in relation to Lebanon. Related controls are also imposed on the provision of technical assistance, financial services and funds, and brokering services.
The Regulations provide for certain exceptions to this sanctions regime, in particular in relation to acts done for the purpose of national security or the prevention of serious crime. The Regulations also confer powers on the Secretary of State to issue licences in respect of activities that would otherwise be prohibited under the trade sanctions imposed.
The Regulations make it a criminal offence to contravene, or circumvent, any of the prohibitions in these Regulations and prescribe the mode of trial and penalties that apply to such offences. The Regulations also confer powers on specified maritime enforcement officers to stop and search ships in international and foreign waters for the purpose of enforcing specified trade sanctions and to seize goods found on board ships which are being, or have been, dealt with in contravention, or deemed contravention, of those prohibitions. The Regulations prescribe powers for the provision and sharing of information to enable the effective implementation and enforcement of the sanctions regime.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1412/2006 of 25 September 2006, concerning certain restrictive measures in respect of Lebanon is revoked by these Regulations. The Lebanon (Technical Assistance, Financing and Financial Assistance) (Penalties and Licences) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/2681) are also revoked.
An Impact Assessment has not been produced for these Regulations, as they are intended to ensure existing sanctions remain in place following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. An Impact Assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and can be found at:

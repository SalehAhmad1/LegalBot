These Regulations make provision concerning the membership and procedure of Digital Health and Care Wales (“DHCW”). DHCW is a Special Health Authority established under section 22 of the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 by the Digital Health and Care Wales (Establishment and Membership) Order 2020.
In particular, Part 2 of these Regulations provides the procedure for the appointment of the office of the chair, vice-chair, the chief officer and other members of DHCW (regulations 3, 4 and 5). Part 3 makes provision regarding the term of office of those appointments (regulations 6, 7 and 8). Part 4 makes provision in relation to eligibility and disqualification of members (regulations 9 and 10) and suspension and removal from office of members (regulations 11, 12, 13 and 14).
Part 5 makes provision relating to the procedures of DHCW, including the powers of a vice-chair in the chair’s absence (regulation 15) and the appointment of, and exercise of functions by, committees, sub-committees, joint committees and joint sub-committees (regulations 16 and 17). Provision is also made in relation to the conduct of meetings and proceedings (regulation 18). Part 6 makes provision requiring DHCW to prepare and keep accounts and to prepare and furnish reports to the Welsh Ministers (regulations 19 and 20).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

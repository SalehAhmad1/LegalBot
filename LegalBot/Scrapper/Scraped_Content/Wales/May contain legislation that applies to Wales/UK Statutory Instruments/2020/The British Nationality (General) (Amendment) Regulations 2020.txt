(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the British Nationality (General) Regulations 2003 (“the 2003 Regulations”), which detail the procedures and requirements relating to applications in connection with British nationality made under the British Nationality Act 1981 (“the 1981 Act”). In particular, regulation 5A sets out the circumstances in which an applicant for naturalisation as a British citizen under section 6 of the 1981 Act is to be taken to have sufficient knowledge of the English language and about life in the United Kingdom for the purposes of the application.
The Home Office has set up a scheme, the Windrush Scheme, to deal with requests concerning the immigration or British nationality status of certain people who settled in the United Kingdom before 1st January 1973, as well as people who arrived between that date and 31st December 1988. Regulation 2 is made in connection with that scheme.
Regulation 2 amends the 2003 Regulations so that returned residents who had indefinite leave to enter or remain in the UK on 1st January 1973 but who subsequently lost and re-acquired that leave, fall within the definition of a ‘relevant pre-1973 entrant’ at paragraph (5) of regulation 5A and are thereby considered to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the English language and life in the United Kingdom. The amendments made by Regulation 2 provide that eligible children of returned residents will also be considered to fulfil this requirement and will remain an eligible child of a pre-1973 entrant where the parent subsequently loses their indefinite leave to remain.
Regulation 3 adds Malta to the list of specified English speaking countries at paragraph 2 of Schedule 2A to the 2003 Regulations.
Hard copies of the Windrush Scheme can be obtained from the Home Office, Access to Work, Services and Windrush Policy Group, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF or at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-scheme.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

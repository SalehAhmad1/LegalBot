(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;

(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.

(a)
any building falling within paragraph (1) and any land within its curtilage; and

where necessary or expedient, land which is adjacent to the building falling within paragraph (1) but outside its curtilage (whether or not such adjacent land is inside or outside the Order limits).
(4) The power to survey buildings and land conferred by paragraph (3) includes the power to place and leave monitoring apparatus on land or within a building and to remove such apparatus.

where the works cannot be carried out reasonably conveniently without entering land which is adjacent to the building but outside its curtilage, enter the adjacent land (whether or not such adjacent land is inside or outside the Order limits) but not any building erected on it,
and in either case the undertaker may take exclusive possession of the building and land if this is reasonably necessary for the purpose of constructing the protective works.
(6) Before exercising—
(a)
a right under paragraph (1) to carry out protective works to a building;
(b)
a right under paragraph (3) to enter a building and land within its curtilage;
(c)
a right under paragraph (5)(a) to enter and take possession of a building and land within its curtilage; or

(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.

(5) Section 11 M2 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 25), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A M3 (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B M4 (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date, 12 M5 (unauthorised entry) and 13 M6 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 M7 (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 31(4) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—

13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraw the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.

(2) If, for the purpose of carrying out any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the statutory undertaker in question 28 days' written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a statutory undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the statutory undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the statutory undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably practicable use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) The obligation imposed on the statutory undertaker under sub-paragraph (3) does not extend to the exercise by the statutory undertaker of any power to acquire any land or rights in land by compulsory purchase order.

(7) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (6), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the statutory undertaker in question that it desires itself to carry out any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being carried out by the statutory undertaker, may be carried out by the undertaker, in accordance with plans and in a position agreed between the statutory undertaker and the undertaker or, in default of agreement, determined by arbitration in accordance with article 67 (arbitration), without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the statutory undertaker.
(8) In carrying out any work under sub-paragraph (7) the undertaker must comply with all statutory obligations which would have been applicable had the works been carried out by the statutory undertaker.

(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the statutory undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that statutory undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

(2) Those works must be carried out only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the statutory undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the statutory undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the carrying out of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a statutory undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 28 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a statutory undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs (1) to (4) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2).

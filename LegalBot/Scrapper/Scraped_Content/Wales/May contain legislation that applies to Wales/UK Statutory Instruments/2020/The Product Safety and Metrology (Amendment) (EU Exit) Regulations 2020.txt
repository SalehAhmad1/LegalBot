(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend two sets of Regulations which were made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular, in relation to the provisions these Regulations amend, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) of section 8(2) and paragraph (a) of section 8(3) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. The two sets of Regulations are the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/696) (“the 2019 Regulations”) and the Product Safety, Metrology and Mutual Recognition Agreement (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1246), Part 3 of which itself amends the 2019 Regulations. These Regulations therefore address the same deficiencies as the Regulations they amend address (namely, in particular, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) of section 8(2) and paragraph (a) of section 8(3) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 20108).
The amendments made in these Regulations change references to “exit day” to references to “IP completion day” in the two sets of Regulations amended and as such are consequential on the agreement that the United Kingdom will remain following EU law until IP completion day.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Order)
Part 1 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 (c. 28) (“the 2007 Act”) provides for structural and boundary changes in relation to local government areas in England. Structural change is a change from two-tier local government (a county council and district councils) in an area to a single tier of local government. There is a single tier of local government for an area if there is either a county council and no district councils for that area, or a district council and no county council for that area (section 1(2) of the 2007 Act).
The Secretary of State may by order implement (with or without modification) a proposal received for a single tier of local government (section 7 of the 2007 Act). This order makes provision which is incidental, consequential and supplementary to the implementation by order of structural change in Buckinghamshire (the Buckinghamshire (Structural Changes) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/957)) (“the Buckinghamshire Order”). Article 2 makes provision as to the Conservation Board for the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty to reflect the changes to local authority arrangements as a result of the Buckinghamshire Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

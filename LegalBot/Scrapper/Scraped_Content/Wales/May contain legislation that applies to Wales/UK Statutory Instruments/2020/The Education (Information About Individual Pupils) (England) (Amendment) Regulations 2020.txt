(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Information About Individual Pupils) (England) Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”), which prescribe various pieces of information about individual pupils that the proprietors of certain schools are required to provide, on request, to the Secretary of State or other prescribed persons.
Schedule 1 to the 2013 Regulations prescribes some of those pieces of information, including: the number of school sessions that the pupil (or former pupil) could have attended during a given period; the number of authorised and unauthorised absences from those sessions; and (in certain cases) the reasons for the absences. Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends Schedule 1 to the 2013 Regulations to expand the range of information that must be provided on request to include the number of all attendances and non-attendances recorded in the school’s attendance register in each of the different ways specified in the Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 and any information recorded about them in the electronic register (if there is one). Regulation 2 also revokes a definition used in the 2013 Regulations that is no longer needed.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

26th November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) (“the International Travel Regulations”) to add Aruba, Bhutan, Kiribati, Mongolia, the Federated States of Micronesia, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga and Vanuatu to the list of exempt countries and territories at Schedule A1, from which passengers arriving in England are not required to self-isolate. Estonia and Latvia are also removed from the list.
These Regulations also revoke the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Travel from Denmark) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1277), which placed restrictions on travel to the UK from Denmark and remove additional amendments made to the International Travel Regulations which accompanied those restrictions.
Passengers are not required to self-isolate on arrival in England if, during the 14 days preceding their arrival, they have only been in or transited through exempt countries or territories, or exempt parts of countries or territories. Passengers who have been in or transited through a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory, must self‑isolate until 14 days have elapsed since the day after they last left a non-exempt country or territory, or a non-exempt part of a country or territory. The changes to Schedule A1 will not affect passengers who arrive in England before 4.00 a.m. on 28th November 2020.

28th January 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018 (“the principal Regulations”).
These Regulations set fees for applications for entry clearance to enter, and applications for limited leave to remain in, the United Kingdom as a Global Talent Migrant under the United Kingdom immigration rules. They also set fees for applications for approval letters from an endorsing body in respect of proposed applications of this kind, and fees for applications by dependants of a Global Talent Migrant for entry clearance to enter, and for limited leave to remain in, the United Kingdom under those rules. For these purposes, “Global Talent Migrant” and “endorsing body” are defined by reference to the United Kingdom immigration rules, as most recently amended by the Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules laid before Parliament on 30th January 2020 (HC 56).
These Regulations also amend paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 to the principal Regulations to provide for a reduction of the new fees for applications for entry clearance and limited leave to remain as a Global Talent Migrant where the applicant is a national of a State which has ratified the European Social Charter agreed by the Council of Europe at Turin on 18th October 1961 (ETS No. 035).
The amendments to the principal Regulations made by these Regulations also remove existing fees relating to applications for entry clearance to enter, and applications for limited leave to remain in, the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) Migrant, and existing fees for approval letters connected with such applications. The United Kingdom immigration rules no longer provide for such applications. However, dependants of individuals who have already been granted entry clearance to enter or leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Exceptional Talent) Migrant will still be able to apply for entry clearance or limited leave to remain in that capacity, and the fees for such applications are therefore retained (see fee 2.1.1 in Table 2 in Schedule 1 to the principal Regulations, and fee 7.1.1 in Table 7 in Schedule 2 to those Regulations).
An impact assessment has been prepared in respect of this instrument and the Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules laid before Parliament on 30th January 2020. The impact assessment is available alongside these Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk and from the Home Office, Fees and Income Planning Team, 8th Floor, Southern House, Wellesley Grove, Croydon, CR0 1XG.

2nd June 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement amendments made to Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (“the 2010 Directive”) (OJ No L 153, 18.6.2010, p. 13). The 2010 Directive was amended by Directive 2018/844/EU of 30 May 2018 (“the 2018 Amending Directive”) (OJ No L 156, 19.06.2018, p.75) and Regulation 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action (“the 2018 Regulation”) (OJ No L 328, 21.12.2018, p. 1).
These Regulations transpose articles 2a, 10(6) and 20(2) of the 2010 Directive as amended by the 2018 Amending Directive and 2018 Regulation by amending the Energy Efficiency (Building Renovation and Reporting) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”) (S.I. 2014/952).
Regulation 1(3) provides that these Regulations cease to have effect at the instant immediately before the point immediately before IP completion day.
Regulation 2 inserts new regulations 5A to 5C into the 2014 Regulations.
New regulation 5A requires the Secretary of State, after consultation with Northern Ireland departments, Scottish Ministers, Welsh Ministers and the public, to submit a long-term renovation strategy to the Commission of the European Union.
New regulation 5B requires the Secretary of State and other competent authorities to link financial support for energy efficiency improvements in the renovation of buildings to targeted or achieved energy savings. This is necessary to link UK Government financial support to the quality of energy renovation. This regulation requires this be done using the results of a relevant, transparent, and proportionate method that shows the improvement in energy performance.
New regulation 5C requires the Secretary of State and other competent authorities to provide information to owners or tenants of buildings to improve the energy performance of their building. This should include information about energy performance certificates, cost-effective measures and, where appropriate, financial instruments. Information on the replacement of fossil fuel boilers with more sustainable alternatives should also be provided to owners or tenants of buildings. This must be done via accessible and transparent advisory tools such as renovation advice and one-stop shops.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum and a transposition note are available with these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

(a)
approve the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation for the scheme year, making any corrections to the historical activity level, preliminary annual number of allowances or final annual number of allowances determined or calculated by the regulator that the UK ETS authority considers appropriate; and
(b)
inform the regulator accordingly.
(7) The regulator must give notice to the operator of the installation—
(a)
of the relevant error;

34W.—(1)  The regulator may, by notice (a “notice to withhold”) to the registry administrator, require the registry administrator to withhold allowances that would otherwise have been allocated in respect of an installation under article 34E or to a person with an entry in the aviation allocation table under article 34O in any of the following circumstances—
(a)
if the regulator is investigating whether the installation has ceased operation;
(b)
if the operator of the installation has applied to surrender the installation's permit under paragraph 11 of Schedule 6 but the application has not yet been determined;
(c)
if a surrender notice under that paragraph or a revocation notice under paragraph 12 of that Schedule has been given to the operator of the installation but the surrender or revocation of the permit has not yet taken effect;
(d)
if an appeal against a revocation notice given to the operator of the installation has been made and has not been determined or withdrawn;
(e)
if the regulator is assessing a renunciation notice given by the operator of the installation under Article 24 of the Free Allocation Regulation;
(f)
if, following an application for the transfer of the installation's permit under paragraph 7 of Schedule 6, the regulator—
(i)
considers that, if the application is granted, there may be a merger or split (as defined in Article 2(17) and (18) of the Free Allocation Regulation); or
(ii)
is assessing the reports referred to in Article 25(3) of that Regulation;
(g)
in a case where allowances have not already been allocated in respect of the installation for a scheme year, if the regulator is investigating whether, as a result of a relevant error (as defined in article 34H), the final annual number of allowances set out in the allocation table to be allocated in respect of the installation for the scheme year exceeds the number that would otherwise have been set out in the table but for the relevant error;
[F2(ga)
in relation to allowances that would otherwise have been allocated in respect of the installation for the 2023 scheme year, if the operator of the installation has made an application under Article 5a of the Activity Level Changes Regulation that has not been determined or has been granted an extension of time to make such an application that has not expired;]
[F3(gb)
if the regulator is investigating for the purposes of Article 2b(4)(b) of the Free Allocation Regulation whether the installation has produced electricity for sale for consumption outside the installation;]
(h)
if the regulator is investigating whether the person with an entry in the aviation allocation table has permanently ceased to perform aviation activity under article 34P;
(i)
if the regulator is assessing an application under article 34Q for the transfer of some or all of the aviation free allocation entitlement of the person with an entry in the aviation allocation table;
(j)
in a case where allowances have not already been allocated to a person for a scheme year under article 34O, if the regulator is investigating whether, but for a relevant error (as defined in article 34R), the number of allowances set out in the aviation allocation table as the person's aviation free allocation entitlement for the scheme year would be materially less.
(2) The notice to withhold must set out the installation referred to in [F4paragraph (1)(a) to (ga)] [F4paragraph (1)(a) to (gb)] or the person referred to in paragraph (1)(h) to (j).
(3) Where a notice to withhold is given, no allowances may be allocated in respect of the installation set out in the notice, or to the person set out in the notice, until a further notice under paragraph (4) is given.
(4) The regulator may by further notice to the registry administrator withdraw the notice to withhold at any time, and must do so as soon as reasonably practicable after the circumstances for giving the notice to withhold no longer apply and, where relevant, the UK ETS authority has updated the allocation table in consequence of those circumstances.
(5) Where the regulator gives a notice to withhold, the regulator must also give notice to the operator of the installation set out in the notice to withhold, or to the person set out in the notice to withhold, setting out the reasons for giving the notice.
(6) Where the regulator gives a further notice under paragraph (4), the regulator must also give notice to the operator of the installation set out in the notice to withhold, or to the person set out in the notice to withhold, setting out any explanation that the regulator considers appropriate.]

RE is the installation's reportable emissions (determined as if the modification made to Article 38(2) of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018 by [F2paragraph 13(4)(a)(i)] of Schedule 7 did not apply) in the penalty year;
[F3FA is—
(a)
where—
(i)
an application in respect of the installation was made under the Free Allocation Regulation for free allocation in the same allocation period as the penalty year is in; and
(ii)
the UK ETS authority informed the regulator under Article 15a(4) of that Regulation that the application was valid,
the number of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent represented by the final annual number of allowances that would have been allocated under Part 4A in respect of the installation for the penalty year if the installation had not been a hospital or small emitter for the penalty year, disregarding any adjustment to free allocation that might have been made under the Activity Level Changes Regulation;
(b)
in any other case, zero;]
CP is the carbon price for the penalty year;
PP is, where a penalty notice imposing a civil penalty under article 54 in respect of the penalty year has previously been given to the operator, the amount of the civil penalty.
(5) In this article—
“hospital-qualifying installation” has the meaning given in paragraph 1 of Schedule 7;
“maximum amount” has the meaning given in that paragraph;
“penalty year” means a scheme year for which the installation—
(a)
is a hospital or small emitter; but
(b)
would not have been a hospital or small emitter if, by reason of the matters referred to in paragraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii), the regulator had, in the default year, given a conversion notice as required by paragraph 23(1) to (3) of Schedule 7 to the operator of the installation.

(a)
1st January in the year following the default year is not in the same allocation period as the excess year; or
(b)
a permit for the installation is in force on that date.
(5) When setting the amount of the civil penalty to be imposed, the regulator may increase the amount calculated under paragraph (2)(b) by a factor designed to ensure that the amount of the civil penalty exceeds the value of any economic benefit that the operator has obtained as a result of carrying out a regulated activity that was not authorised by the relevant permit.
(6) The regulator must—
(a)
estimate CA and RE under paragraph (2); and
(b)
exercise the regulator's functions under paragraph (5),
in accordance with a direction given by the relevant national authority under section 52 of CCA 2008.
(7) In this article—
“maximum amount” has the meaning given in paragraph 1 of Schedule 8;

1.  For mixed fuels, the aircraft operator may either assume the absence of biomass and apply a default fossil fraction of 100% or determine a biomass fraction in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3.
2.  Where biofuels are physically mixed with fossil fuels and delivered to an aircraft in physically identifiable batches, the aircraft operator may carry out analyses in accordance with Articles 32 to 35 to determine the biomass fraction on the basis of a relevant standard and the analytical methods set out in those Articles, provided that the use of that standard and those analytical methods is approved by the regulator. Where the aircraft operator provides evidence to the satisfaction of the regulator that such analyses would incur unreasonable costs or are technically not feasible, the aircraft operator may base an estimation of the biomass fraction on a mass balance of fossil fuels and biofuels purchased.
3.  Where purchased biofuel batches are not physically delivered to a specific aircraft, the aircraft operator shall not use analyses to determine the biomass fraction of the fuels used. In such a case, the aircraft operator may determine the biomass fraction using purchase records of biofuel of equivalent energy content, provided that the aircraft operator provides evidence to the satisfaction of the regulator that there is no double counting of the same biofuel quantity, in particular that the biofuel purchased is not claimed to be used by anyone else.
4.  Where a biofuel meets the sustainability criteria F14..., the emission factor of the biofuel shall be zero; and for the purpose of determining whether the sustainability criteria are met, the biofuel (wherever supplied) must be treated as supplied in the United Kingdom.
5.  Where a biofuel does not meet [F15the sustainability criteria], the carbon content of the biofuel shall be treated as fossil carbon.
[F166.  In this Article, “sustainability criteria”, in relation to biofuel, means the sustainability criteria (within the meaning of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007) that applied for the purposes of that Order on the date of purchase of the biofuel.”].]

Transfer of permits: grant of application
9.—[F19(1) An application for the transfer or partial transfer of a permit may be granted only if—
(a)
the regulator considers that, from the transfer date, the new operator—
(i)
will be the operator of the installation;
(ii)
will be capable of monitoring and reporting the installation’s reportable emissions in accordance with the monitoring and reporting conditions of the permit (including as varied under this paragraph); and
(iii)
where the application is for the transfer or partial transfer of a greenhouse gas emissions permit of an installation that is an FA installation, will be capable of complying with the free allocation conditions of the permit (including as varied under this paragraph);
(b)
the monitoring plan or the variations referred to in paragraph 8(1)(d) and, in the case of an application for the partial transfer of the permit, the variations referred to in paragraph 8(1)(e) have been approved under the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018 (see paragraph 8(1A)); and
(c)
where the application is for the transfer or partial transfer of a greenhouse gas emissions permit of an installation that is an FA installation, the monitoring methodology plan or the variations referred to in paragraph 8(2)(a) and, in the case of an application for the partial transfer of the permit, the variations referred to in paragraph 8(2)(b) have been approved under the Free Allocation Regulation (see paragraph 8(4)).]
[F20(1A) But [F21sub-paragraph (1)(a)(iii) and (c) do not apply] if the application contains a statement by the new operator that the new operator renounces free allocation in respect of the transferred units.]
(2) Where an application for a transfer or a partial transfer is granted, the regulator must give notice of the transfer to—
(a)
the transferring operator; and
(b)
the new operator.
(3) Where an application for the partial transfer of a permit is granted—
(a)
the regulator must issue a new greenhouse gas emissions permit (the “new permit”) to the new operator that—
(i)
sets out that the new permit comes into force on the transfer date;
(ii)
sets out the transferred activities and the transferred units at which the transferred activities may be carried out;
(iii)
includes such other provisions as the regulator considers appropriate to take account of the transfer;
(b)
the regulator may make such corresponding variations under paragraph 6 to the permit (the “original permit”) held by the transferring operator as the regulator considers appropriate to take account of the transfer;
(c)
the new permit comes into force on the transfer date to authorise the transferred activities to be carried out at the transferred units from that date;
(d)
the variations to the original permit have effect from the transfer date (which must be set out in the original permit).
[F22(3A) But if the new operator already holds a permit (the “existing permit”) for an installation that is on the same site as the transferred units, the regulator may, instead of issuing a new greenhouse gas emissions permit to the new operator under sub-paragraph (3), vary the existing permit under paragraph 6 so that it includes such variations as the regulator considers necessary to take account of the transferred units and transferred activities; and if the regulator does so—
(a)
the regulator must make such corresponding variations under paragraph 6 to the permit (the “original permit”) held by the transferring operator as the regulator considers appropriate to take account of the transfer;
(b)
the variations to the existing permit and the original permit have effect from the transfer date, which must be set out in the existing permit and the original permit.]
(4) Where an application for the transfer of a permit (other than for a partial transfer) is granted—
(a)
the regulator must vary the permit under paragraph 6 so that it includes—
(i)
the name and other particulars of the new operator;
(ii)
the transfer date;
(iii)
such variations to the monitoring plan as the regulator considers appropriate;
(b)
the new operator is the holder of the permit as varied from the transfer date.
(5) But if the new operator already holds a permit (the “existing permit”) for an installation that is on the same site as the transferred units, the regulator may, instead of varying the transferring operator's permit under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
vary the existing permit under paragraph 6 so that it includes such variations as the regulator considers necessary to take account of the transferred units and transferred activities; and the variations have effect from the transfer date, which must be set out in the existing permit; and
(b)
by giving notice to the transferring operator, cancel the permit held by the transferring operator so that the permit ceases to authorise regulated activities to be carried out from the transfer date.
[F23(5A) Where a permit is cancelled under sub-paragraph (5)(b), the regulator must give notice to the registry administrator as soon as reasonably practicable.]
(6) In this paragraph, “transfer date” means the date agreed by the transferring operator, the new operator and the regulator as the date on which the transfer or partial transfer to the new operator is to take effect.

Surrender of permits
11.—(1) Where a permit authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation that has ceased operation, the operator must apply to the regulator to surrender the permit on or before—
(a)
the last day of the period of 1 month beginning with the day on which it ceased operation; or
(b)
such later date as may be agreed by the regulator.
(2) Where a permit authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation where a regulated activity is no longer being carried out but it is not technically impossible to resume operation, the operator of the installation may apply to the regulator to surrender the permit.
(3) Where the regulator grants an application to surrender a permit under sub-paragraph (1) or (2), the regulator must give a notice (a “surrender notice”) to the operator.
(4) The surrender notice must—
(a)
set out a date (the “end date”) on which the surrender of the permit takes effect;
(b)
require the operator to—
(i)
submit to the regulator on or before a date set out in the notice a report of the installation's reportable emissions in the period beginning on 1st January in the scheme year (the “end year”) in which the end date falls and ending on the end date;
(ii)
ensure that the report is prepared and verified in accordance with the monitoring and reporting conditions of the permit;
[F25(iii)
where the permit is a greenhouse gas emissions permit, on or before a date set out in the notice (which must not be before 30th April in the end year), surrender allowances equal to the sum of—
(aa)
the installation’s reportable emissions in the period referred to in sub-paragraph (i); and
(bb)
if, in relation to reportable emissions before that period, the operator fails to comply with the surrender condition of the permit, the number of allowances in respect of which the operator fails to comply.]
(5) The operator must comply with the requirements of the surrender notice.
(6) Where a surrender notice is given—
(a)
the permit ceases to be in force on the end date (and therefore ceases to authorise a regulated activity to be carried out at the installation from that date); but
(b)
the conditions of the permit continue to have effect as if the permit were in force until the regulator certifies that the conditions of the permit and the requirements of the surrender notice have been complied with [F26or that there is no reasonable prospect of their being complied with].
(7) The reference in sub-paragraph (6)(b) to the conditions of the permit that continue to have effect includes a reference to conditions relating to reportable emissions [F27, or reports on activity levels,] before the end year that the operator is required to comply with on or before a date that may fall after the end date (for example, in the case of a greenhouse gas emissions permit, the [F28conditions referred to in paragraph 4(2)(b) and (6)(b)] and the surrender condition or, in the case of a hospital or small emitter permit, the condition referred to in paragraph 11(2)(b) of Schedule 7).
[F29(8) Despite sub-paragraphs (6)(b) and (7), the condition referred to in paragraph 4(6)(b) does not have effect to require the operator to prepare a report on the installation’s activity levels in the scheme year before the first non-entitled scheme year (as defined in Article 26(2) of the Free Allocation Regulation).]

(2) Where a permit authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation that is included in the ultra-small emitter list for 2026-2030, the regulator must revoke the permit so that it ceases to be in force at the end of 31st December 2025.
(3) The regulator may revoke a permit if—
(a)
the operator fails to comply with—
(i)
a requirement imposed on the operator by or under—
(aa)
this Order;
(bb)
the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018;
(cc)

(ii)
a condition of the permit; or
(b)
the operator of an installation fails to pay the charge for maintaining the permit in force M10.
(4) A permit is revoked by giving a notice (a “revocation notice”) to the operator.
(5) The revocation notice must—
(a)
set out a date (the “end date”) on which the revocation of the permit takes effect;
(b)
require the operator to—
(i)
submit to the regulator on or before a date set out in the notice a report of the installation's reportable emissions in the period beginning on 1st January in the scheme year (the “end year”) in which the end date falls and ending on the end date;
(ii)
ensure that the report is prepared and verified in accordance with the monitoring and reporting conditions of the permit;
[F31(iii)
where the permit is a greenhouse gas emissions permit, on or before a date set out in the notice (which must not be before 30th April in the end year), surrender allowances equal to the sum of—
(aa)
the installation’s reportable emissions in the period referred to in sub-paragraph (i); and

(6) The operator must comply with the requirements of the revocation notice.
(7) Where a revocation notice is given—
(a)
the permit ceases to be in force on the end date (and therefore ceases to authorise a regulated activity to be carried out at the installation from that date); but
(b)
the conditions of the permit continue to have effect as if the permit were in force until the regulator certifies that the conditions of the permit and the requirements of the revocation notice have been complied with [F32or that there is no reasonable prospect of their being complied with].
(8) The reference in sub-paragraph (7)(b) to the conditions of the permit that continue to have effect includes a reference to conditions relating to reportable emissions [F33, or reports on activity levels,] before the end year that the operator is required to comply with on or before a date that may fall after the end date (for example, in the case of a greenhouse gas emissions permit, the [F34conditions referred to in paragraph 4(2)(b) and (6)(b)] and the surrender condition or, in the case of a hospital or small emitter permit, the condition referred to in paragraph 11(2)(b) of Schedule 7).
[F35(8A) Despite sub-paragraphs (7)(b) and (8), the condition referred to in paragraph 4(6)(b) does not have effect to require the operator to prepare a report on the installation’s activity levels in the scheme year before the first non-entitled scheme year (as defined in Article 26(2) of the Free Allocation Regulation).]
(9) A regulator who gives a revocation notice may, by notice to the operator, withdraw the revocation notice at any time before the end date.

Emissions targets: banking overachieved target
20.—(1) In this paragraph, an installation's “bankable amount”, in relation to a scheme year, means ET – RE, where—
ET is the installation's emissions target for that year;
RE is the reportable emissions stated in the installation's emissions report for that year.
(2) But if the installation's emissions target for a scheme year is calculated in accordance with any of the following provisions (emissions targets based on estimates), for the purposes of this paragraph the installation's bankable amount for that scheme year must be treated as zero—
(a)
paragraph 16(4)(a);
(b)
paragraph 16(5)(a) or (b);
(c)
paragraph 17(4)(a);
(d)
paragraph 17(5)(a) or (b).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraphs (5) and (6), where an installation's bankable amount for a scheme year (the “scheme year in question”) is greater than zero—
(a)
the regulator may increase the installation's emissions target for the following scheme year (the “next scheme year”) by the bankable amount; and
(b)
if the regulator does so, the regulator must vary the installation's hospital or small emitter permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 by substituting the increased emissions target for the existing target.
(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (6), where the amount of reportable emissions stated in the installation's emissions report for the scheme year in question is amended following a determination of emissions under article 45, the regulator must—
(a)
calculate the bankable amount for the scheme year in question as if RE in sub-paragraph (1) were the amount of reportable emissions for that year as amended following the determination; and
(b)
where an increased emissions target for the next scheme year has been substituted under sub-paragraph (3)(b), further vary the permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 by substituting a revised emissions target for that year, based on the revised calculation of the bankable amount under paragraph (a).
(5) Sub-paragraph (3) does not apply if the scheme year in question is—
(a)
the 2025 scheme year;
(b)
the 2030 scheme year.
(6) Except where the installation is a hospital-qualifying installation, if increasing the emissions target for the next scheme year would result in an emissions target that exceeds the maximum amount, the emissions target must be increased by such amount as results in an emissions target of the maximum amount.

(a)
an installation is an ultra-small emitter for any of the 2021, 2022, 2023, 2026, 2027 and 2028 scheme years; and
(b)
the regulator considers that the installation's reportable emissions in any of those years (the “excess year”) exceed the maximum amount.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (7), the regulator must, as soon as reasonably practicable, give a notice to the operator of the installation.
(3) The notice must—
(a)
set out the grounds for the notice;
(b)
state that the installation is not an ultra-small emitter—
(i)
where the notice is given in the scheme year following the excess year, for the scheme year following the scheme year in which the notice is given;

comply with the conditions of the permit—
(aa)
where paragraph (b)(i) applies, from 1st January in the scheme year following the year in which the notice is given; or
(bb)
where paragraph (b)(ii) applies, from no later than the date (the “relevant date”) set out in the notice.
(4) But the notice must also state that, where sub-paragraph (5) applies, the operator must apply for a hospital or small emitter permit and comply with the requirements of that permit, instead of a greenhouse gas emissions permit.
(5) This sub-paragraph applies where—
(a)
the operator within 14 days of the date of the notice—

(b)
the regulator gives notice to the operator that the regulator considers that the installation is not an ineligible installation.
(6) Where sub-paragraph (3)(b)(ii) applies, although the installation is not an ultra-small emitter for the scheme year in which the notice is given (see paragraph 2), the operator—
(a)
must comply with paragraph 5 in respect of the period beginning on 1st January in the scheme year in which the notice is given and ending on the earlier of—
(i)
the day before a permit for the installation comes into force; and
(ii)
the relevant date;
(b)
is not liable to a civil penalty under article 50 in respect of that period (but is liable to a civil penalty under article 60).
(7) Sub-paragraph (2) does not apply where—
(a)
it is not possible for the notice to be given in the same allocation period as the excess year; or
(b)
although it is possible for the notice to be given in the same allocation period as the excess year, the regulator considers that it would not be reasonable to expect the operator to apply for a permit before the end of the allocation period.

where relevant, determine the historical activity level of every sub-installation referred to in paragraph 3(1)(b) in accordance with Article 17(1) of the Free Allocation Regulation;]
(a)
calculate the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation and of each sub-installation of the installation for each eligible scheme year;
(b)
send the [F13determination (if any) and] calculation to the UK ETS authority.
[F14(3) The final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of a sub-installation for an eligible scheme year is the preliminary annual number of allowances to be allocated for the scheme year multiplied by the reduction factor for the scheme year (as defined in Article 18a(11) of the Free Allocation Regulation), where—
(a)
for sub-installations referred to in paragraph 3(1)(b), the preliminary annual number of allowances must be calculated in accordance with Article 18(1) of the Free Allocation Regulation;
(b)
for all other sub-installations, the preliminary annual number of allowances is the number previously calculated under Article 16 of the Free Allocation Regulation (including any corrections required under Article 16(11)).]
(4) But where the relevant notice is a notice under paragraph 7 of Schedule 8 and the first eligible scheme year is the scheme year referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of that term in paragraph 1 of this Schedule, the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of a sub-installation for the first eligible scheme year is the number calculated under sub-paragraph (3) of this paragraph multiplied by D/Y, where—
D is the number of days in the first eligible scheme year after the date on which the installation’s greenhouse gas emissions permit comes into force;
Y is the number of days in the first eligible scheme year.
(5) The final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of an installation for an eligible scheme year is the sum of the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of all sub-installations of the installation for the scheme year.
(6) On receipt of the [F15determination (if any) and] calculation, the UK ETS authority must as soon as reasonably practicable—
(a)
approve the final annual number of allowances to be allocated in respect of the installation, making any corrections to the calculation [F16(including, in the case of a sub-installation referred to in paragraph 3(1)(b), to the historical activity level and preliminary annual number of allowances)] that the UK ETS authority considers appropriate;
(b)
inform the regulator accordingly.
(7) The regulator must give notice to the operator of the final annual number of allowances approved under sub-paragraph (6).
(8) For the purpose of the calculations referred to in sub-paragraphs (3) to (5), the number of allowances to be allocated in respect of sub-installations and installations must be expressed as the nearest integer, taking 0.5 as nearest to the previous integer.

SCHEDULE 11
Transitional provisions: installations
Permits under GGETSR 2012
1.—(1) This paragraph applies to a permit within the meaning of GGETSR 2012 that immediately before this Schedule comes into force authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation.
(2) But this paragraph does not apply to a permit—
(a)
in respect of which an application under regulation 13 of GGETSR 2012 for the surrender of the permit has been made but has yet to be determined;
(b)
that is due, in accordance with provision made under GGETSR 2012, to be surrendered or revoked; or
(c)
that authorises a regulated activity to be carried out at an installation included in the ultra-small emitter list for 2021-2025.
(3) Where the installation is included in the hospital and small emitter list for 2021-2025, the regulator must—
(a)
convert the permit into a hospital or small emitter permit the provisions of which satisfy the requirements of paragraph 11 of Schedule 7 and that authorises the regulated activity to be carried out at the installation from 1st January 2021; and
(b)
give notice of the conversion to the operator of the installation.
(4) In any other case, the regulator must—
(a)
convert the permit into a greenhouse gas emissions permit the provisions of which satisfy the requirements of paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 and that authorises the regulated activity to be carried out at the installation from 1st January 2021; and
(b)
give notice of the conversion to the operator of the installation.
(5) When converting a permit under sub-paragraph (3) or (4), the regulator may make only such changes to the operator's obligations under the permit as the regulator considers necessary to convert the permit into a greenhouse gas emissions permit or, as the case may be, a hospital or small emitter permit.
(6) But sub-paragraph (5) does not prevent the regulator correcting errors.
(7) When converting a permit under sub-paragraph (4), the regulator may include under paragraph 4(2)(d) of Schedule 6 a condition to give proper effect to Article 69(4) of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018 that requires the operator to submit a report to the regulator relating to non-conformities or recommendations for improvements stated in a verification report under [F1Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067 (as it had effect in EU law)] in respect of the scheme year (within the meaning of GGETSR 2012) beginning on 1st January 2020.
(8) The conversion of a permit under sub-paragraph (3) or (4) does not affect the operator's obligations under the permit in respect of specified emissions before 1st January 2021 (and GGETSR 2012 continue to apply in relation to such obligations).
(9) A permit that is converted under this paragraph continues in force as if issued under this Order until cancelled, surrendered or revoked under this Order.

Applications for permits, etc. under GGETSR 2012
2.—(1) An application under regulation 10 of GGETSR 2012 for a permit for an installation that is made to the regulator before 1st January 2021, but not determined before that date—
(a)
where the installation is included in the hospital and small emitter list for 2021-2025, must be treated as an application for a hospital or small emitter permit under paragraph 7 of Schedule 7 to this Order;
(b)
in any other case (except where the installation is included in the ultra-small emitter list for 2021-2025), must be treated as an application for a greenhouse gas emissions permit under paragraph 1 of Schedule 6 to this Order.
(2) An application under regulation 11 of GGETSR 2012 to vary a permit that is made to the regulator before 1st January 2021, but not determined before that date, must be treated as an application to vary the permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 to this Order.
(3) An application under regulation 12 of GGETSR 2012 for the transfer of a permit that is made to the regulator before 1st January 2021, but not determined before that date, must be treated as an application to transfer the permit under paragraph 7 of Schedule 6 to this Order.
[F2(4) This sub-paragraph applies where—
(a)
a permit for an installation is converted into a greenhouse gas emissions permit under paragraph 1(4);
(b)
the monitoring methodology plan approved in respect of the installation under Article 8 of the Free Allocation Regulation is contained in the permit by virtue of paragraph 4(1)(hb) or (7) of Schedule 6; and
(b)
a significant modification of the monitoring methodology plan is notified for approval under Article 9 of the Free Allocation Regulation on or before 31st December 2020, but not approved before that date.
(5) Where sub-paragraph (4) applies, the notification of the significant modification must be treated as an application to vary the permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 to make the significant modification.]

Sch. 11 para. 3 in force at 12.11.2020, see art. 2(1)EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order establishes a new emissions trading scheme covering greenhouse gas emissions from power and heat generation, energy intensive industries and aviation. The scheme will be called the UK Emissions Trading Scheme or UK ETS (see article 16). It is the successor, in the UK, to the EU Emissions Trading System (established by Directive 2003/87/EC).
Part 1 contains definitions that are used throughout the Order, including key concepts such as the “trading period” (1 January 2021 to 31 December 2030 – see article 4) the activities covered by the scheme (“regulated activity”, defined in article 4 and Schedule 2, and “aviation activity”, defined in article 4 and Schedule 1), the different greenhouse gases covered by the scheme (see article 4 and Schedule 2 for installations and the definition of “aviation emissions” for aircraft), the participants in the scheme (“operators” of installations, defined in article 5, and “aircraft operators”, defined in articles 6 to 8) and who the scheme's “regulator” is for different purposes (articles 9 to 13). Article 15 introduces Schedule 3 which contains provision about applications, notices, etc.
Part 2, after introducing the scheme and establishing a review requirement (articles 16 and 17), sets out other elements of the scheme relevant to both operators of installations and aircraft operators. The basic proposition of the scheme is that, for each year, participants have to surrender “allowances” equivalent to their greenhouse gas emissions within the scope of the scheme. So article 18 sets out what an allowance is and articles 19 to 22 set out rules limiting the number of allowances that can be issued. Article 23 permits allowances to be traded except where this is prohibited by other legislation. The rules on how allowances are to be issued do not, however, appear in this Order and will be the subject of separate legislation on free allocation of allowances and auctioning. Articles 24 and 25 introduce Schedules 4 and 5 which adapt existing EU legislation on monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, and how reports of emissions are verified, for the purposes of the UK ETS.
Parts 3 and 4 contain provisions specific (respectively) to operators of installations and aircraft operators. The scheme has slightly different rules for these different types of participants. For operators of installations there is a general rule that they need a permit (article 26(1)) and need to surrender allowances to account for emissions (article 27). From the general rule, there are different levels of derogation for hospitals and small emitters and for ultra-small emitters. Detailed provision in respect of each category of operator is set out in Schedules 6 to 8, although for operators subject to the general rule, and for hospitals and small emitters, many of the rules take the form of specified contents of permits. For aircraft operators, there is no need for a permit as such. However, aircraft operators must apply for emissions monitoring plans which fulfil some of the same functions (article 28). For aircraft operators, provisions about reporting emissions and surrendering allowances are in articles 33 and 34.
Part 5 contains provision allowing the regulators to charge for the performance of their regulatory functions under the Order.
Part 6 contains provision allowing the regulators to monitor compliance with the Order, including through inspections of premises and exercising powers of entry.
Part 7 contains provision about enforcement, including a range of civil penalties (articles 50 to 68) that may be imposed in respect of specified breaches of the Order or of permit conditions. General provision about civil penalties is in articles 47 and 48. In addition, article 44 makes provision about enforcement notices and article 45 about circumstances where a regulator can determine the greenhouse gas emissions of a participant in the UK ETS.
Part 8, which is supplemented by Schedules 9 and 10, contains provision about appeals from decisions made by the regulator about applications and appeals in respect of a number of notices (specified in article 70(2)) that may be given under the Order.
Part 9 brings together provisions without a natural home elsewhere in the Order, covering information notices (article 75), Crown application (article 76) and transitional provisions (article 77 with Schedule 11).
A regulatory impact assessment of the effect that the UK ETS will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Industrial Energy Directorate, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0ET and is available alongside the instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

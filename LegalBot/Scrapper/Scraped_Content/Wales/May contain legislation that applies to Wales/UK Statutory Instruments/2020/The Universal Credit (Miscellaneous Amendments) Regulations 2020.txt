(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376) (“the UC Regulations”) and the Universal Credit, Personal Independence Payment, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance (Claims and Payments) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/380) (“the Claims and Payments Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends regulation 82 of the UC Regulations, which provides an exemption from the benefit cap that would otherwise apply in accordance with regulations made under section 96 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012. The amendment makes it clear that claimants are exempt from the application of the benefit cap if their previous employment was paid at the national living wage in force during that period of employment. This ensures claimants benefit from having a history of sustained employment even if the national living wage has subsequently increased.
Regulation 3 amends regulations 38 and 40 of the Claims and Payments Regulations to enable the Secretary of State to request, and landlords to provide, evidence regarding a claimant’s housing costs where a change of circumstances has occurred.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

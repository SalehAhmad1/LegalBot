(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 (“the 2006 Regulations”) to relax requirements on schools in relation to keeping registers of pupil attendance, in light of the fact that, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, not all children who would usually be expected to attend school are doing so.
Regulation 2(3) inserts a provision into the 2006 Regulations the effect of which is to disapply, from the date these Regulations come into force until the end of the 2019-20 school year, the obligations on a school in the 2006 Regulations to record specified particulars in the school’s attendance register.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

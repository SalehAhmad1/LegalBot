Coming into force

The Secretary of State makes these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 1, 2(1) and 3 of, and paragraph 3(a) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 9 of Schedule 3 to, the Public Service Pensions Act 2013(1).
In accordance with section 21 of that Act, the Secretary of State has consulted such persons, and the representatives of such persons, as appeared to the Secretary of State to be likely to be affected by these Regulations.
The retrospective provision contained in these Regulations does not appear to the Secretary of State to have significant adverse effects in relation to the pension payable to or in respect of members of the scheme established by the Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 2013(2) or the schemes preserved by the Local Government Pension Scheme (Transitional Provisions, Savings and Amendment) Regulations 2014(3), nor in any other way in relation to members of those schemes. Accordingly, the procedures set out in section 23 of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 are not applicable in respect of these Regulations.
In accordance with section 3(5) of that Act, these Regulations are made with the consent of the Treasury.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 2013 to create a discretion for administering authorities to determine the amount of exit credit which should be payable to an employer leaving the Local Government Pension Scheme. Section 3(3)(b) of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 provides that scheme regulations may make retrospective provision.
No impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations because no impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

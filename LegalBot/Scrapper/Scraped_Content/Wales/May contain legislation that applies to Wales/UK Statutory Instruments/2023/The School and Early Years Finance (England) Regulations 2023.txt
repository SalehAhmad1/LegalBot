(ii)
62.5 in respect of all-through schools; and
(iii)
120 in respect of secondary schools other than middle schools or all-through schools,

(a)
a value of 1, with each school being allocated the same weighting; or
(b)
a value determined as follows—
(i)
if D is equal to or greater than C, the value of 1;
(ii)
if D is less than C but greater than 0.8 x C, the value of 1 – (C – D) / (0.2 x C).
(13) The final value is the amount given by multiplying the year-group weighting, the distance weighting and the lump-sum funding for sparsity determined by the local authority and that lump sum must not exceed £100,000.
(14) The local authority must use the same method of calculating the final value in accordance with paragraphs (11) to (13) in respect of all schools to which paragraph (10) applies.
(15) For the purposes of paragraphs (9) to (14)—
A is the number which represents the average size of a year group at the school (derived by dividing the number of pupils by the number of year groups);

A is the value of the factor in the local authority’s funding formula (the “local factor value”) for the previous funding period except—
(a)
where a local authority did not use this factor in its formula for the previous funding period, in which case A should be taken as £0; or
(b)
in the case of the factor relating to English as an additional language, if—
(i)
in the previous funding period, the local authority used the EAL1 version of the factor relating to English as an additional language, then A = the local factor value x 0.333;
(ii)
in the previous funding period, the local authority used the EAL2 version of the factor relating to English as an additional language, then A = the local factor x 0.667;
B is the national funding formula factor value for the previous funding period(1), adjusted to account for geographical variations in labour market costs (the “area cost adjustment” or “ACA”(2)), except where a local authority is in the London fringe area, where B = the national funding formula factor value for the previous funding period, adjusted by the lowest ACA applied within that local authority;
C is the absolute value of A – B;
D is the local factor value for this funding period;
E is the national funding formula factor value in this funding period(3), adjusted to account for geographical variations in labour market costs (the “area cost adjustment” or “ACA”(4)), except where a local authority is in the London fringe area, where E = the national funding formula factor in this funding period, adjusted by the lowest ACA applied within that local authority;
F is the absolute value of D – E;
(2) The local authority must set D so that—
(a)
F is equal to or smaller than (C x 0.9); or,
(b)
D is equal to or greater than (E x 0.975); and
(c)
D is equal to or smaller than (E x 1.025).
(3) If A is smaller than B, the local authority must set D to be equal to, or smaller than (E x 1.025).
(4) If A is greater than B, the local authority must set D to be equal to, or greater than (E x 0.975).
(5) In this regulation—
“the absolute value” of a number means that number expressed as a positive number;
“EAL1” means the version of the factor relating to English as an additional language that is applied only in respect of a pupil who—
(a)
has English as an additional language; and
(b)
was not recorded as attending a school or schools in England on any school census before 7th October 2021;
“EAL2” means the version of the factor relating to English as an additional language that is applied only in respect of a pupil who—

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for local authorities’ financial arrangements in relation to the funding of maintained schools and providers of funded early years provision in England, for the financial year 2023-2024.
The School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/59) are revoked on 1st April 2023. The School and Early Years Finance (England) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/27) remain in force.
These Regulations define the non-schools education budget (regulation 4 and Schedule 1), the schools budget (regulation 6 and Schedule 2), central expenditure and the individual schools budget (regulation 8 and Schedule 2). They require local authorities to determine budget shares for schools maintained by them and amounts to be allocated in respect of early years provision in their areas, in accordance with the appropriate formulae (regulations 10 and 11). Regulations 13, 15 and 17 to 22 make provision for certain factors that the local authority must include in their local funding formulae for certain schools. In relation to early years, local authorities are required in their formulae to include one or more social deprivation factors (regulation 16) and information about hours of attendance (regulation 23). Regulation 29 provides that a local authority must set single per pupil amounts, or single sums or lump sums for certain mandatory factors in the calculation of the local authority funding formula for schools. The allowable ranges for these amounts or sums are set in relation to the distance between their respective value in the national funding formula, and the value in the local authority’s funding formula in the previous funding period (financial year 2022 – 2023).
The Regulations also impose a minimum per pupil amount (regulation 30) and a minimum funding guarantee for schools (regulation 31 and Schedule 4). There is a requirement to pass 95 per cent of funding to early years providers (regulation 32) and a twelve per cent limit on the amount of funding that may be attributable to the discretionary (supplementary) part of the early years formulae (regulation 33). There are also requirements in relation to local authorities’ schemes (regulation 40 and Schedule 5). Regulation 26 makes provision in the event that a school enters into a risk protection arrangement.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

but otherwise, the HRT only PPC is valid from the date on which the application is received.
(7) A HRT only PPC is only valid in respect of a prescription item that is a listed HRT prescription item at the time of the supply of the prescription item, unless—
(a)
the prescription item was a listed HRT prescription item before that time but it has since been removed from the list in the Drug Tariff; and
(b)
it was a listed HRT prescription item at the time the prescription in pursuance of which the product is supplied was issued (whether the product is supplied in accordance with that prescription or a serious shortage protocol),
in which case, the HRT only PPC is also valid in respect of that product.
(8) As regards any HRT only PPCs that are to be valid during the first month for which any arrangements as mentioned in paragraph (1) are made—
(a)
the date to be included by the applicant in the application pursuant to paragraph (5) must be a date no earlier than the date on which the arrangements start; and

Amended by S.I. 2018/1114.Signed by authority of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
Neil O’Brien
Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,
Department of Health and Social Care
20th February 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013 (“the PLPS Regulations”), which govern the arrangements in England, under Part 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”), for the provision of pharmaceutical and local pharmaceutical services. These Regulations also amend the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) Regulations 2015 (“the Charges Regulations”), which include the charges payable for the supply of drugs and appliances as part of the NHS in England. They also amend the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2015 (“the GMS Regulations”) and the National Health Service (Personal Medical Services Agreements) Regulations 2015 (“the PMS Regulations”), which make provision in respect of the services provided in England under a general medical services contract or a personal medical services agreement made pursuant to Part 4 of the 2006 Act.
The amendments made to the Charges Regulations provide for the introduction of a pre-payment certificate (PPC) purchasable by NHS patients who are prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT) drugs or appliances which are on a list of HRT products that is to be published in the Drug Tariff (“the Drug Tariff list”). Purchasers of such PPCs will be exempt from any prescription charges that would otherwise be payable for the products on the Drug Tariff list under the Charges Regulations. These PPCs will be valid for a period of 12 months (regulations 6, 7, 9 and 10).
If a HRT product is on the Drug Tariff list, prescribers in GP practices that hold contracts under the GMS Regulations or the PMS Regulations are required to prescribe one item per NHS prescription form or repeatable prescription, whenever they prescribe items on that list (the number of items that they may prescribe on each NHS prescription form or repeatable prescription is not otherwise restricted under the GMS Regulations or the PMS Regulations) (regulations 13 and 16). If a NHS community pharmacy or the dispensary of a NHS dispensing doctor does receive a NHS prescription form or repeatable prescription with at least one item on the Drug Tariff list on it, together with at least one other item, they may refuse to dispense any of the items on that prescription form or repeatable prescription if the patient is claiming a prescription charge exemption for any of those items on the basis of the new PPC (regulations 2 to 5).
Ordinarily, community pharmacies must dispense exactly what is written on a prescription form or repeatable prescription but in the event of actual or anticipated serious shortages, the Secretary of State has the power to issue Serious Shortage Protocols (SSPs) to enable them to dispense alternatives. If a smaller quantity of a drug or appliances needs to be dispensed, patients who would otherwise have needed to pay a prescription charge were already exempt from doing so. This principle is extended so that if additional items have to be dispensed (for example, a new inhaler to support the supply of an alternative drug), no additional prescription charges are payable (regulation 8).
Where the Secretary of State acquires information about medicines shortages or the discontinuation of the supply of medicines under the Health Service Products (Provision and Disclosure of Information) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/677), he or she has powers to pass that information on to providers of NHS services such as GP practices. However, prior to these Regulations, no statutory gateway existed for the Secretary of State to supply that information to GP practices via intermediaries who would not otherwise be authorised to have that information, such as providers of GP prescribing software. Where a GP practice that holds a contract under the GMS or PMS Regulations wishes to receive this type of information via their prescribing software and the supplier of the prescribing software is able to fulfil that wish, a new obligation is imposed on the GP practice, as part of their GP contract, to include in their contract with their supplier of prescribing software appropriate provision to reflect that wish – giving effect to which is then supported by the creation of the necessary statutory gateway (regulations 11, 12, 14 and 15).
An impact assessment in relation to the measures in these Regulations that relate to prepayment certificates for hormone replacement therapy treatments is available from the Department of Health and Social Care, 39 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0EU. A copy of it is also published alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk. A full impact assessment has not been undertaken in relation to the other measures in these Regulations as they are not expected to have a significant impact on the public and voluntary sectors, and only a limited impact on the private sector, below the threshold for undertaking a full impact assessment.

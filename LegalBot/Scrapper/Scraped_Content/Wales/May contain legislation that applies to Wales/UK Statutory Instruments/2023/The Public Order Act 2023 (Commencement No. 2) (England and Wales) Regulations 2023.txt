These Regulations bring into force provisions of the Public Order Act 2023 (c. 15) (“the Act”). They are the third commencement regulations to be made under the Act, but the second which extend only to England and Wales.
Regulation 2 brings into force sections 30 and 31 of the Act.
Section 30 confers powers on the Secretary of State to issue guidance to chief officers of police and the chief constables of the British Transport Police, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and the Ministry of Defence Police in relation to serious disruption prevention orders. Chief officers of police and such chief constables must have regard to any such guidance issued.
Section 31 requires the Secretary of State to lay a draft of any guidance proposed to be issued under section 30 before Parliament for 40 days (excluding any days during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or adjourned for more than 4 days). If within that 40 day period either House resolves not to approve the guidance it may not be issued.

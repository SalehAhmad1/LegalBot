20th November 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of this Order)
This Order increases candidate election expense limits and registered party expenditure limits for UK parliamentary elections, Northern Ireland Assembly elections and local government elections in England to take into account inflation since the limits were set. The limits have been increased by 80.06%, 80.06% and 31.03% respectively. The Order also increases several political donation reporting thresholds by 49.09%. Percentages here have been rounded to 2 decimal places. The calculated figures have been rounded down to the nearest £10. The extent of the increases also reflect the passage of time since the figures were set.
Article 2 increases the expenses limits for candidates in UK parliamentary general elections, known as the short campaign and the long campaign. Separate spending limits apply in each of these periods. It also increases the fixed limit for candidates in parliamentary by-elections and in local government elections in England.
Article 3 increases the campaign expenditure limits for registered parties for relevant periods in UK parliamentary general elections and Northern Ireland Assembly elections.
Article 4 increases the thresholds for the reporting of regulated donations (and/or transactions as the case may be) for registered parties, regulated donees and permitted participants (in the context of referendums under Part 7 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (c. 41)).
Article 5 makes a transitional provision so that certain existing campaign expenditure limits in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 apply to any expenditure during a relevant period prior to the coming into force of article 3, while the new campaign expenditure limits (as provided for by that article) apply to expenditure during the whole of that relevant period which begins before but ends on or after that coming into force date.
In addition, article 5 makes a transitional provision so that, where a political contribution triggers the notification requirement for the reporting of gifts received by the association to the Electoral Commission between 31st October 2023 and 31st December 2023, the reporting thresholds as provided for by article 4 do not apply to gifts received up to and including 31st December 2023, even if reported after that date. It also provides that the new thresholds do not apply for the purposes of reporting in relation to the quarter ending on 31st October 2023.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

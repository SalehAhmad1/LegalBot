(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends Schedule 2 to the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/330) so as to clarify that the waiver of fees otherwise payable by those who fall within the Appendix Temporary Permission to Stay for Victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery to the immigration rules (HC 719) issued on 18th October 2022 applies to all those coming within that Appendix. That regulation also makes consequential amendments to that Schedule.
Regulation 3 of, and the Schedule to, these Regulations amend the Passport (Fees) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/660). The amendments increase some of the fees imposed in Parts 1 and 2 of the Schedule to those Regulations in respect of passport applications by approximately 9.1% and reduce the fees in respect of certain other passport applications specified in those Parts.

PART 3
INTERPRETING THE STANDARDS
21 The standards specified in Part 1 of this Schedule must be interpreted as follows.
22
The standards only apply to the extent that a body—
(a)
delivers services to a person, or
(b)
deals with any other person in connection with delivering services—
(i)
to that other person, or
(ii)
to a third person.
23 The standards only apply to the extent that the standards relate to the provision by a body of a service provided to the public in the exercise of the body’s functions as a water undertaker or a sewerage undertaker for the whole or any part of Wales.
24 A body is not required to produce, to publish, to display or to send material in Welsh to the extent that another enactment has specified the wording of a document, a sign or a form which would run contrary to that requirement.
25
For the purposes of the standards—
(a)
a requirement to produce, to send, to publish, to display, to make available or to issue any written material in Welsh does not mean that the material should be produced, sent, published, displayed, made available or issued in Welsh only, nor does it mean that the material should be produced in Welsh first (unless that is specifically stated in the standard);
(b)
a requirement to provide a service or activity in Welsh does not mean that that service or activity should only be provided in Welsh (unless that is specifically stated in the standard).
26
(1) A body is not required to translate into Welsh any text that it has not produced (“text A”).
(2) A body will not be treating the Welsh language less favourably if it does not translate text A into Welsh but see sub-paragraph (3).
(3) A body must use the Welsh version of text A if another person has produced text A in Welsh in accordance with—
(a)
its Welsh Language Scheme,
(b)
a duty to comply with standards,
(c)
Standing Orders of Senedd Cymru,
(ch)
section 35(1C) of the 2006 Act, or
(d)
the Senedd Commission’s Official Languages Scheme.
(4) In this paragraph—
(a)
“Welsh Language Scheme” means a Welsh language scheme produced in accordance with Part 2 of the Welsh Language Act 1993(1);
(b)
“a duty to comply with standards” means a duty to comply with a standard under section 25 of the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011;
(c)
“the 2006 Act” means the Government of Wales Act 2006(2);

(d)
“the Senedd Commission’s Official Languages Scheme” means the Scheme adopted and published under paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 to the 2006 Act.
27
(1) If the conditions in paragraphs (a) to (c) are met or the condition in sub-paragraph (2) is met, a body is not required to comply with any of the standards in respect of an activity or a service referred to in paragraph (b)—
(a)
the first condition is that an emergency has occurred, is occurring or is about to occur;
(b)
the second condition is that the activity being carried out or the service being provided by the body is necessary for the purpose of preventing, controlling or mitigating an aspect or effect of an emergency;
(c)
the third condition is that the need for the activity or the service referred to in paragraph (b) is urgent.
(2) The condition is that the body is undertaking an emergency drill.
(3) If the condition in sub-paragraph (2) is met, then the reference to “an emergency” in sub-paragraph (1)(b) is to be read as “the simulated emergency situation”.
28 For the purposes of standards 2 and 32, a body corresponds with a member of the public in Wales or sends a form to a member of the public in Wales for the first time when it corresponds or sends a form for the first time after the date on which a compliance notice has required the body to comply with the standard.
29 For the purposes of standards 2 and 4, “system generated correspondence” means bills, meter reading requests, new account correspondence and account closure correspondence.
30 For the purposes of standards 7, 10, 11, 13 and 16, “service helpline” means a telephone helpline dealing with water services or sewerage services but not account enquiries.
31 In standard 17, an “automated” telephone system means a system that answers telephone calls and guides persons through a set procedure with a recorded message which, for example, asks a person to press different keys in order to choose different options.
32 Standards 18 to 19C do not apply when the meeting is held at short notice (for example, when a body makes door to door enquiries).
33
Where a standard refers to material that is to be produced in Welsh (with the exception of standards 36 to 42 (websites and apps) and 44 and 45 (social media)), references to treating the Welsh language no less favourably than the English language, or to treating a Welsh language version no less favourably than an English language version, include, amongst other matters, (and in addition to specific matters referred to in any individual standard), treating the Welsh language no less favourably as regards—
(a)

(b)
the size of the material;
(c)
the position and prominence of the material in any public place;
(ch)
when and how the material is published, provided or exhibited;
(d)

(1)
1991 c. 56.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 (nawm 1) (“the 2011 Measure”) makes provision for the specification of standards of conduct in relation to the Welsh language (“standards”). These replace the system of Welsh language schemes provided for by the Welsh Language Act 1993 (c. 38).
Section 26 of the 2011 Measure enables the Welsh Ministers to specify standards, and section 39 enables them to provide that a standard is specifically applicable to a person by authorising the Welsh Language Commissioner (“the Commissioner”) to give a notice to that person requiring compliance with the standard (a “compliance notice”).
These Regulations specify standards in relation to the conduct of water and sewerage undertakers set out in Schedule 4 to the Regulations (which are referred to in the Regulations as “bodies”). Water and sewerage undertakers are appointed under section 6 or by a variation of an appointment under section 7 of the Water Industry Act 1991 (c. 56).
The Regulations also authorise the Commissioner to give a compliance notice to those bodies, in relation to standards specified by the Regulations. This is referred to in the 2011 Measure as making a standard “specifically applicable” to a body.
Because the bodies which these standards relate to are within Schedule 8 to the 2011 Measure, section 37 of the 2011 Measure provides that only service delivery standards and record keeping standards can be made specifically applicable to them. A service delivery standard only applies to the extent that it relates to the provision by the body of a service specified in column 2 of the body’s entry in Schedule 8 to the 2011 Measure. In the case of the water and sewerage undertakers falling within Schedule 4 to these Regulations, the specified services are services provided to the public in the exercise of the functions of water undertaker or sewerage undertaker (as appropriate) for the whole or any part of Wales.
In accordance with section 44 of the 2011 Measure, the Commissioner may (by way of a compliance notice) require a body to comply with one or more standards that are specifically applicable to it. To reflect that, the standards specified by the Regulations are expressed in the second person narrative, meaning that they are in “you must” form (where “you” means the relevant body in each case).
Using the flexibility provided by section 44 of the 2011 Measure, the Commissioner may (if it is reasonable and proportionate, and the Commissioner wishes to do so) require a body to comply with one standard in some circumstances and another standard in other circumstances. For example, if a standard is specifically applicable to a body, the Commissioner may require the body to comply with the standard in some circumstances but not others, or require it to comply with the standard only in some areas. Similarly, if two or more standards relate to a specific conduct (for example, standards 8 and 9 in relation to answering telephone calls), the Commissioner may (by way of a compliance notice) require a body to comply with one of those standards only, or with different standards at different times, in different circumstances, or in different areas, as is appropriate for the body. The Commissioner is not, therefore, obliged to require every body to comply with every standard.
In accordance with section 46 of the 2011 Measure, the compliance notice given to a body must state the imposition day, or imposition days; meaning the day or days upon which the body becomes required to comply with a standard (or comply with a standard in a specific way). Using the flexibility provided for by section 46, the Commissioner may set an early imposition day for a body to comply with a standard (provided this is at least 6 months after the date on which the body was given the related compliance notice), or set an imposition day further in the future (for example, in relation to more challenging standards).
Where a standard specified in these Regulations requires written material to be displayed or provided in Welsh, or for a service to be provided in Welsh, this does not mean that the material must be displayed or provided in Welsh only, or that the service must only be provided in Welsh (unless that is specifically stated).
Schedule 1 to the Regulations specifies service delivery standards. Section 28 of the 2011 Measure provides that a “service delivery standard” means a standard that relates to a service delivery activity, and is intended to promote or facilitate the use of the Welsh language, or to work towards ensuring that the Welsh language is treated no less favourably than the English language, when that activity is carried out. A “service delivery activity” means a person delivering services to another person, or dealing with any other person in connection with delivering services to that other person, or to a third person.
Schedule 2 to the Regulations specifies record keeping standards. Section 32 of the 2011 Measure provides that a “record keeping standard” is a standard relating to the keeping of records about other specified standards, records about complaints concerning compliance with other specified standards, or records about other complaints concerning the Welsh language.
Schedule 3 to the Regulations specifies standards that deal with supplementary matters. These are specific forms of service delivery standards and record keeping standards that deal with the matters referred to in section 27(4) of the 2011 Measure (which are supplementary to the matters dealt with in Schedules 1 and 2).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

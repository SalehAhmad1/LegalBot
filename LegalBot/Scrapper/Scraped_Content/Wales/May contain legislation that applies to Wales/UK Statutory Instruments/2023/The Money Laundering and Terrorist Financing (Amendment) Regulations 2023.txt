13th December 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/692) (the “MLRs”) to secure the result referred to in section 77(3) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (c. 29); that for the purposes of assessments under regulation 35(3) of the MLRs, where the customer is a domestic PEP (a politically exposed person), or a family member or known close associate of a domestic PEP, the starting point for the assessment is that the customer presents a lower level of risk than a non-domestic PEP. The extent of enhanced customer due diligence measures to be applied in relation to that customer should be less than for non-domestic PEPs, unless enhanced risk factors apply.

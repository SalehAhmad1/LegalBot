METHOD OF DETERMINING THE STRENGTH OF ALCOHOLIC PRODUCT
1.—(1) Except where sub-paragraph (2) applies, the strength of spirits is to be determined—
(a)
by determining the density of the spirits in air at 20 degrees Celsius and taking the strength of the spirits to be the percentage of alcohol by volume corresponding to that density in the Laboratory Alcohol Table, provided that where the density of any spirits determined as mentioned falls between any two consecutive numbers in that table the strength shall be determined by linear interpolation, or
(b)
using any method that measures the strength of spirits to a level of accuracy equivalent to, or greater than, that measured by a method set out in sub-paragraph (a).
(2) Where spirits contain any substance other than alcohol and water the Commissioners may either—
(a)
require that the strength of the spirits be ascertained by any of the means prescribed by sub-paragraph (1) after removing from the spirits any such substance to the extent which they consider necessary by distillation or such other process as they direct and adding water to replace the volume so removed, or

(ii)
the distillate is to be made up at the temperature of 20 degrees Celsius with distilled water to the original measure of the quantity before distillation,
(iii)
the strength of the distillate made up in accordance with sub-paragraph (ii) is to be ascertained by determining its density in air at the temperature of 20 degrees Celsius by means of a pycnometer, and
(iv)
the strength of alcoholic product is to be taken to be the percentage of alcohol by volume in the Laboratory Alcohol Table which corresponds to the density determined in accordance with paragraph (iii) except that where the density so determined is between two consecutive numbers in the table aforesaid the strength is to be determined by linear interpolation, or
(b)
using any method that measures the strength of alcoholic product to a level of accuracy equivalent to, or greater than, that measured by the method set out in sub-paragraph (a).
(2) Where the result ascertained by a method specified in sub-paragraph (1) is rendered inaccurate by the presence of substances other than alcohol, that method is to be adjusted for the purpose of producing an accurate result until such result is produced.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for a single excise duty system for alcoholic products generally, consolidating and replacing the various systems used for individual alcoholic products. Duty is based on the volume and strength of the finished product. These Regulations also make provision for reliefs from excise duty.
Part 1 of these Regulations provides for citation, commencement and interpretation.
Part 2 provides for a new system for measuring alcoholic strength. Regulations 2 and 3 set out the methods for ascertaining the volume and strength of alcoholic products respectively. Regulation 4 sets out the circumstances in which and the means by which HMRC may carry out assessments where an incorrectly low amount of duty has been applied.
Part 3 makes provision in relation to reliefs from duty. Regulation 5 does so for undrinkable sediment, regulation 6 for grower’s domestic consumption relief and regulation 7 for draught relief. Regulations 8 to 14 do so for small producer relief (specifically as to what constitutes a small producer alcoholic product in Northern Ireland, how payments of duty may be made where products are moved between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, documentation to be provided, and record-keeping.
Part 4, in regulation 15, makes provision in relation to denatured alcohol.
Part 5, in regulation 16, makes provision in relation to travellers’ allowances (specifically in relation to rates).
Schedule 1 provides for the tolerance requirements for large packs filled with metered or weighed volumes of alcoholic product. Schedule 2 provides for the method of determining the strength of alcoholic product where due care has not been taken to ensure that the strength ascertained in accordance with any of the deeming methods set out in regulation 3 accurately represents the actual strength of the alcoholic product.
Any notices referred to in these Regulations will be published at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/alcohols-notices. A person unable to access the notices electronically may access them in hard copy by post free of charge on application to Alcohol Policy, Indirect Tax, HM Revenue & Customs, Trinity Bridge House, 2 Dearmans Place, Salford, M3 5BS.

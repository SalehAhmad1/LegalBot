28th June 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the retained version of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (“the REACH Regulation”).
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends Article 41(5) of the REACH Regulation to extend the periods during which that Article requires the Health and Safety Executive to carry out compliance checks on minimum percentages of certain types of registration dossiers.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations amends Article 127P(4B) of the REACH Regulation to amend the definition of “relevant post-IP completion period”. The change of definition for “relevant post-IP completion period” extends the period within which information must be submitted to the Health and Safety Executive under Articles 127B, 127L and 127M. It also affects the period of time in which a “protected transitional import” can be made under Article 127E(2).
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF, and is published with an Explanatory Memorandum alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

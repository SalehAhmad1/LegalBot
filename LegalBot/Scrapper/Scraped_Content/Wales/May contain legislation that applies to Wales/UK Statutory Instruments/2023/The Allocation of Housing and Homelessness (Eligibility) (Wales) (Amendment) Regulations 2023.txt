(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Allcation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (Wales) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2603 (W. 257)) (“the 2014 Regulations”) which make provision for which persons subject to immigration control are eligible for an allocation of housing accommodation and for housing assistance.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 3 of the 2014 Regulations which relates to the eligibility of persons subject to immigration control for an allocation of housing accommodation under Part 6 the Housing Act 1996 Act (“the 1996 Act”). It prescribes an additional class of persons (“Class M”) subject to immigration control who are eligible for an allocation of housing accommodation under the 1996 Act.
Class M applies to persons who are victims of human trafficking or slavery and who have been granted temporary leave to remain in the United Kingdom in accordance with the Immigration Rules made under section 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77).
Regulation 4 amends regulation 5(1) of the 2014 Regulations which relates to the eligibility of persons subject to immigration control for housing assistance under section 66, 68, 73 or 75 of the Housing (Wales) Act 2014. It prescribes an additional class of persons (“Class N”) who are eligible for such assistance. This class is equivalent to Class M inserted by regulation 3.

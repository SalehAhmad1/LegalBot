(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make adjustments to the level of European seabass that may be caught within British fishery limits, as specified in Article 10 of Council Regulation (EU) 2020/123 (EUR 2020/123), both as by-catch and as a targeted species by commercial fishing vessels. These Regulations also adjust the dates of the fishing seasons for recreational fisheries for European seabass contained in that Article so that the fishing seasons for recreational fisheries are aligned with the fishing seasons for commercial fishing activity.
These Regulations also make adjustments to the list of prohibited species contained in Article 16 of Council Regulation (EU) 2020/123 to remove picked dogfish under or equal to 100cm in length from the list and to add shortfin mako shark to the list. Fish species contained on the prohibited species list may not be targeted, retained on board, transhipped or landed and if accidentally caught must be promptly released back to the sea unharmed.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

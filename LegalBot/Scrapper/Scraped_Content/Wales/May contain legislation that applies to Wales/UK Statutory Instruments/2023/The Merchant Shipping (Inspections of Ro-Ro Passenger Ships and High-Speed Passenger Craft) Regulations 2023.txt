at the request of the company, and

(4) Where the Secretary of State decides that a replacement ship may start operating in accordance with paragraph (3), that ship may only be used to continue to operate the service if, within one month of the ship starting to operate as a replacement ship, or any additional period that the Secretary of State may decide is appropriate, the Secretary of State ensures that an inspection of the ship is carried out consisting of—

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace the Merchant Shipping (Mandatory Surveys for Ro-Ro Ferry and High Speed Passenger Craft) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/152).
These Regulations apply to ro-ro passenger ships and high-speed passenger craft operating a regular service between a port in the UK and a port of a country other than a member State and to those on domestic voyages in sea areas in which ships of class A may operate in accordance with the Merchant Shipping (Passenger Ships on Domestic Voyages) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/2687) (regulation 3). Regulation 4 and Schedule 1 provide for the minimum qualification criteria for inspectors. The requirements for pre-commencement inspections, exemptions from pre-commencement inspections and for regular inspections are set out in regulations 5 to 7 respectively and Schedules 2 and 3.
Regulation 8 makes provision for detention of ships and service of prohibition of departure notices prohibiting a ship’s departure where any deficiencies confirmed or revealed by an inspection in relation to the ship have not been rectified and the deficiencies are hazardous to health or safety. A prohibition of departure notice may also be issued if the Secretary of State has not been able to carry out an inspection as required to do so under these Regulations. All future amendments to the provisions of the international conventions referenced in regulation 2 will be automatically incorporated into the regulation by way of ambulatory reference.
Regulation 9 and Schedule 4 require the drawing up of a written inspection report, set out what must be contained in the report and provide that a copy of the report must be given to the ship’s master and the company. The expression “company”, which is defined in regulation 2, means, in relation to a ship or craft, whoever has agreed to take over obligations imposed by the International Management Code for Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention or in certain cases the owner or whoever has assumed operating responsibility from the owner.
Responsibility for the costs of service of prohibition of departure notices are provided for in regulation 10.
Regulation 12 requires the Secretary of State to review the operation and effect of these Regulations and publish a report before the end of the period of five years beginning with the date on which these Regulations come into force and at intervals not exceeding five years after that. Following a review, it will fall to the Secretary of State to consider whether the Regulations should remain as they are or be amended or revoked. A further instrument would be needed to amend or revoke the Regulations.
Schedule 5 makes consequential amendments.

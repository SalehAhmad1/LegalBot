(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Criminal Legal Aid (Remuneration) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/435; the “2013 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends Schedule 1 to the 2013 Regulations to provide for a fee payable to a trial advocate in a case where a special measures direction provides for a video recording to be admitted under section 28 (video recorded cross-examination or re-examination) of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (c. 23) (the “1999 Act”). Regulation 2(7) inserts amendments providing that in such cases, a fee of £670 per case is payable to the trial advocate of the respect of all cross-examination, including any re-examination, which is recorded by means of video recording and where such a recording is admissible, so far as it relates to any such cross-examination, including re-examination, by virtue of a special measures direction. For this purpose, “special measures direction” has the meaning given in section 33(1) interpretation etc of Chapter I of the 1999 Act. Regulation 2 also clarifies that the trial does not include such a cross-examination or re-examination for the purposes of identifying the “trial advocate” in certain provisions in the 2013 Regulations concerning payment of advocates.
Regulation 3 makes provision about the application of the amendments.

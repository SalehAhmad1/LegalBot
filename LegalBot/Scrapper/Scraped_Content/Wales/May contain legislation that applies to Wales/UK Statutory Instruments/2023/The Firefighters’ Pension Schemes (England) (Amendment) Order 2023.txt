(14) Where a person did not receive a notification from the authority under rule 5B(8) of this Part, despite the authority using reasonable endeavours to notify eligible persons as required by that paragraph, an election under paragraph (1) may take effect after 31st March 2025.”.

“Purchase of service during the extended limited period – total pensionable service
6D.—(1) This rule applies where—

a person joined this Scheme as a special member or as a standard member in respect of service which that person could otherwise reckon as special pensionable service and purchased service following an application under rule 5A of this Part;
(b)
that person purchased additional service under rule 5 of this Part at the same time as the election under rule 5A;
(c)
that person elects to purchase service in respect of the extended limited period under rule 5B of this Part, and
(d)
the addition of the period of service in respect of the extended limited period to the member’s special pensionable service (within the meaning in rule 2A(1) of Part 10) would result in a period exceeding 30 years.
(2) The authority must revise the election to purchase additional service under rule 5, in accordance with paragraph (3), so that the total special pensionable service does not exceed 30 years by the member’s normal retirement age.
(3) The period by which the total special pensionable service would exceed 30 years (“the excess service”) at the member’s normal retirement age is to be deducted from the additional service which the member elected to purchase under rule 5.
(4) Any contributions paid by the member in respect of the excess service are to be deducted from the contributions due in respect of the service in respect of the extended limited period purchased under rule 5B.
(5) Where the contributions paid by the member in respect of the excess service exceed the contributions due in respect of the service purchased under rule 5B, the authority is to refund the excess contributions to the member.
Compensation deduction
6E.—(1) The authority must deduct from a special member’s mandatory special period pension contributions an amount calculated in accordance with this rule (the “compensation deduction”) where a special member—
(a)
elects to pay mandatory special period pension contributions in respect of the special member’s service during the mandatory special period in accordance with rule 6A of this Part, in relation to service purchased following an application under rule 5B of this Part, and
(b)
provides the statement referred to at paragraph (5).
(2) The compensation deduction must be calculated on the advice of the Scheme Actuary and must be equal to the amount of tax relief on mandatory special period pension contributions to which the special member would have been entitled in the compensation scenario described in paragraph (3) (“the compensation scenario”), together with interest calculated at the past interest rate and applied to that amount of tax relief as described under rule 6A(13), taking into account any tax relief on mandatory special period pension contributions that has been received through PAYE.
(3) The compensation scenario means that it is assumed that the special member—
(a)
had been entitled to join this Scheme as a special member on the first day of the mandatory special period;
(b)
from that date, had paid the special period pension contributions in accordance with rule 3(1A) of Part 11 (pension contributions), deducted from each instalment of the member’s pensionable pay in accordance with rule 3(2) of that Part, and
(c)
tax relief on the special period pension contributions at the rate set out in paragraph (4) had been applied at the time each instalment of pensionable pay had been paid.
(4) The rate of tax relief which must be applied in the compensation scenario is—
(a)
where a special member establishes, with such supporting evidence as the authority may reasonably require, that the rate of tax relief which would have applied to the special member in the compensation scenario is a higher tax rate, that higher tax rate, or
(b)
in any other case, the basic rate of tax that would have applied to the special member during the mandatory special period.
(5) In order to be entitled to the compensation deduction the special member must provide a statement to the authority that the special member will not claim tax relief in respect of the mandatory special period pension contributions.”.

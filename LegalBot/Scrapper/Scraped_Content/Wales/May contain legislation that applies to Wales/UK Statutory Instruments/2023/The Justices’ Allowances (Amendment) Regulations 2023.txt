(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Justices’ Allowances Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1423) (“the 2015 Regulations”), which govern the claiming of allowances by lay justices for travelling, subsistence or financial loss under section 15 of the Courts Act 2003.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 2 of the 2015 Regulations. It removes the requirement for lay justices to submit an Annual Declaration and to use a prescribed claim form in order to claim allowances, as well as removing the authorisation for lay justices to submit claims in a different format with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor. It also revokes the Schedules to the 2015 Regulations containing the prescribed forms.
Regulation 2 also prescribes in detail the generic particulars to be provided in order to submit an allowances claim, as well as additional particulars to be provided for a claim for travelling, subsistence or financial loss allowances.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

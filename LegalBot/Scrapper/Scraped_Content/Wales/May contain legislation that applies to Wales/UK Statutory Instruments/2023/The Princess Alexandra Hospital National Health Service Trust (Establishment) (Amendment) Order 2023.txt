It further removes the reference to particular establishments and facilities from which the Trust carries out its functions.
Article 4 omits the specification of the trust’s “operational date” as it is of no on-going relevance.
Article 5 revokes articles 6 and 7 of the Establishment Order as they relate to the period before the operational date and are of no on-going relevance.

4th July 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Taxes (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) (Country-by-Country Reporting Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/237) (“the Principal Regulations”).
The Principal Regulations give effect to the OECD Country-by-Country Reporting Guidance set out in the “Transfer Pricing Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting, Action 13: 2015 Final Report” published on 5th October 2015. (Available on the OECD website at https://www.oecd.org/tax/transfer-pricing-documentation-and-country-by-country-reporting-action-13-2015-final-report-9789264241480-en.htm). The Principal Regulations impose certain reporting requirements on entities that are members of multi-national groups.
These Regulations amend the Principal Regulations to remove a notification requirement ancillary to the main reporting requirement imposed by the Principal Regulations and that is now considered to be unnecessary. These Regulations also make minor consequential amendments to remove redundant cross-references in the Principal Regulations to the revoked notification requirement.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared in relation to these changes as they contain no substantive changes to tax policy.

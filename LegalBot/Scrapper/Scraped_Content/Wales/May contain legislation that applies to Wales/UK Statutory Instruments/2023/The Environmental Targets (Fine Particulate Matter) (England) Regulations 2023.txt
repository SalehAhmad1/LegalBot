11.  This Part applies in relation to monitoring and assessment of PM2.5 levels carried out for the purposes of the annual mean concentration target and the population exposure reduction target.Monitoring stations
12.—(1) The Secretary of State must ensure that the requirements in Schedule 2 (relating to the location and number of monitoring stations and position of monitoring equipment) are met.
(2) Subject to any determination under paragraph (3)(b), every AQSR monitoring station which was in operation immediately before the coming into force of this regulation is a monitoring station for the purposes of these Regulations.
(3) The Secretary of State may from time to time—
(a)
establish new monitoring stations to measure PM2.5 levels for the purposes of these Regulations; or
(b)
determine that a monitoring station is to cease to be used for the purposes of these Regulations, provided that the requirements in paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 (minimum number of monitoring stations) continue to be met.
(4) References to monitoring stations in these Regulations are to monitoring stations for the measurement of PM2.5 levels to which paragraph (2) applies or which are established by the Secretary of State under paragraph (3)(a) except—

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply to England, set—
a target in respect of the annual mean concentration of PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) in ambient air under section 2 of the Environment Act 2021 (c.30) (“the annual mean concentration target”), and
a long-term target to reduce population exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulate matter), within the priority area of air quality under section 1 of that Act (“the population exposure reduction target”).
The Regulations specify, in respect of both targets, the target to be achieved and the date by which it is to be achieved.
Part 2 makes provision in relation to the annual mean concentration target. Regulation 4 sets the target to ensure that the annual mean concentration of PM2.5 in ambient air is equal to or less than 10 micrograms per cubic metre by 31st December 2040. Regulation 5 makes provision about how this is to be measured.
Part 3 makes provision in relation to the population exposure reduction target. Regulation 7 sets the target to ensure that there is at least a 35% reduction in population exposure to PM2.5 by 31st December 2040, as compared with a baseline period of 1st January 2016 to 31st December 2018. Regulation 8 makes provision about how this is to be measured, taking into account any changes over time to the network of monitoring stations used to measure PM2.5 levels. Schedule 1 specifies calculations to be made for the purposes of enabling it to be determined whether the target is met and enabling progress towards meeting the target to be measured.
Regulations 6 and 9 set the reporting date for each target for the purposes of section 6(1) of the Environment Act 2021.
Part 4 and Schedule 2 contain provisions about monitoring and assessment which apply in relation to both targets.
Part 5 and Schedule 3 contain provisions about information to be published.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF, and is published with an Explanatory Memorandum alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

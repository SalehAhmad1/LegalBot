(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/238) (“the 2015 Regulations”), which provide for the making and recovery of charges for relevant services provided under the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41) to overseas visitors (people who are not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom).
Regulation 2 amends regulation 13A of the 2015 Regulations, which is concerned with charges for the provision of healthcare services to individuals who have made a late application for leave to remain or enter under the European Union Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”). The amendments provide that individuals who have made such an application, but have not been granted EUSS pre-settled or settled status, must not be charged for relevant healthcare services provided to them whilst their application is under consideration, and that any charges for such services which have already been made should either not be collected or, if already paid, should be refunded.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

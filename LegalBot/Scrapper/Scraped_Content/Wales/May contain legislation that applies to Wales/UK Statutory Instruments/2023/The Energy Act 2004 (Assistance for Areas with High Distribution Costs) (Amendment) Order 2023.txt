(This note is not part of the Order)
The Energy Act 2004 (Assistance for Areas with High Distribution Costs) Order 2005 (“the 2005 Order”) (S.I. 2005/528) established the Hydro Benefit Replacement Scheme (“HBRS”) for Great Britain. The HBRS is a scheme for offsetting the costs of distributing electricity in a specified area of northern Scotland and is implemented by way of modifications to the conditions of the licences of authorised suppliers, authorised transmitters (in effect, only the operator of the electricity transmission system for Great Britain) and authorised distributors in the specified area (in effect, only the one electricity distributor operating in the specified area).
This Order makes a number of modifications to the licence conditions of authorised suppliers (article 3 and Schedule 1) and authorised transmitters (article 4 and Schedule 2) with respect to the HBRS. It also amends overarching text in the 2005 Order regarding the implementation of the HBRS (article 2).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument because no significant, impact on business, civil society organisation or the public sector is foreseen.
The licences modified by this Order may be inspected at the Registry of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, 10 South Colonnade, Canary Wharf, London E14 4PU.

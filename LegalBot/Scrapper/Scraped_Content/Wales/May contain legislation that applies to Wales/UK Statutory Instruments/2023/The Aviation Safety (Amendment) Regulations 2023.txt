(a)
Upon receiving an application from an organisation for the initial issue of a certificate, the CAA must verify the organisation’s compliance with the applicable requirements.
(b)
The CAA must convene a meeting with the accountable manager of the applicant at least once during the investigation for initial certification to ensure that that person understands their role and accountability.
(c)
The CAA must record all the findings issued, closure actions as well as the recommendations for the issue of the certificate.
(d)
The CAA must confirm to the organisation in writing all the findings raised during the verification. For initial certification, all findings must be corrected to the satisfaction of the CAA before the certificate can be issued.
(e)
When satisfied that the organisation complies with the applicable requirements, the CAA may:
1.
issue the certificate in Appendix III (CAA Form 3-145) in accordance with the class and rating system provided for in Appendix II;
2.
formally approve the MOE.
(f)
The certificate reference number must be included on the CAA Form 3-145 certificate.

The certificate must be issued for an unlimited duration. The privileges and the scope of the activities that the organisation is approved to conduct, including any limitations as applicable, must be specified in the terms of approval attached to the certificate.
(h)
To enable the organisation to implement changes without prior CAA approval in accordance with point 145.A.85(c), the CAA must approve the relevant MOE procedure that sets out the scope of such changes and describes how such changes will be managed and notified to the CAA.
145.B.330    Changes – organisations
(a)
Upon receiving an application for a change that requires prior approval, the CAA must verify the organisation’s compliance with the applicable requirements before issuing the approval.
(b)
The CAA must establish the conditions under which the organisation may operate during the change unless the CAA determines that the organisation’s certificate needs to be suspended.
(c)
When it is satisfied that the organisation complies with the applicable requirements, the CAA must approve the change.
(d)
Without prejudice to any additional enforcement measures, if the organisation implements changes requiring prior approval without having received the approval of the CAA pursuant to point (c), the CAA must consider the need to suspend, limit or revoke the organisation’s certificate.
(e)
For changes not requiring prior approval, the CAA must include the review of such changes in its continuing oversight in accordance with the principles set out in point 145.B.300. If any non-compliance is found, the CAA may notify the organisation, request further changes, and act in accordance with point 145.B.350.
145.B.350    Findings and corrective actions; observations
(a)
The CAA must have a system in place to analyse findings for their safety significance.
(b)
The CAA must issue a level 1 finding when any significant non-compliance is detected with the applicable requirements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, with the organisation’s procedures or manuals, or with the organisation’s certificate including the terms of approval, which lowers safety or seriously endangers flight safety.
(c)
Level 1 findings include:
1.
any failure to grant the CAA access to the organisation’s facilities referred to in point 145.A.140 during normal operating hours and after two written requests;
2.
obtaining the organisation certificate or maintaining its validity by falsification of the submitted documentary evidence;
3.

4.
the lack of an accountable manager.
(d)
The CAA must issue a level 2 finding when any non-compliance is detected with the applicable requirements of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, with the organisation’s procedures or manuals, or with the organisation’s certificate including the terms of approval, which is not classified as a level 1 finding.
(e)
Where a finding is detected during oversight or by any other means, the CAA must, without prejudice to any additional action required by Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, communicate the finding in writing to the organisation and request corrective action to address the non-compliance identified.
1.
Where there are any level 1 findings, the CAA must take immediate and appropriate action to prohibit or limit the activities of the organisation involved and, if appropriate, it must take action to revoke the certificate or to limit or suspend it in whole or in part, depending on the extent of the level 1 finding, until successful corrective action has been taken by the organisation.
2.
Where there are any level 2 findings, the CAA must:
(i)
grant the organisation a corrective action implementation period appropriate to the nature of the finding which must not be more than 3 months. The period must commence from the date of the written communication referred to in point (e). The CAA may extend the corrective action implementation period referred to in point (e) provided the relevant organisation has agreed a corrective action plan with the CAA;
(ii)
assess the corrective action plan and implementation plan proposed by the organisation and accept them if they are sufficient to address the non-compliance.
3.
If the organisation fails to submit an acceptable corrective action plan, or fails to perform the corrective action within the time period accepted or extended by the CAA, the CAA must raise the finding to level 1 and action must be taken as laid down in point (e)(1).
4.
The CAA must record all the findings that it has raised or that have been communicated to it and, where applicable, the enforcement measures it has applied, as well as all corrective actions and the dates of the action closures for all the findings.
(f)
The CAA may issue observations for any of the following cases not requiring level 1 or level 2 findings:
1.
for any item whose performance has been assessed to be ineffective;
2.
when it has been identified that an item has the potential to cause a non-compliance under point (b) or (d);
3.
when suggestions or improvements are of interest for the overall safety performance of the organisation.
(g)
The CAA must communicate the observations issued under this point in writing to the organisation and must keep a record of those observations.
145.B.355    Suspension, limitation and revocation
The CAA must:
(a)
suspend a certificate where it considers that there are reasonable grounds to believe that such action is necessary to prevent a credible threat to aircraft safety;
(b)
suspend, revoke or limit a certificate where such action is required pursuant to point 145.B.350;
(c)
suspend or limit in whole or in part a certificate where unforeseeable circumstances outside the control of the CAA prevent its inspectors from discharging their oversight responsibilities over the oversight planning cycle.”.Amendment of Appendix II to Annex II to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014
24.  For Appendix II substitute—
“APPENDIX II
CLASS AND RATING SYSTEM FOR THE TERMS OF APPROVAL OF PART-145 MAINTENANCE ORGANISATIONS
(a)
Except as stated otherwise for the smallest organisations referred to in point (m), the table in point (l) provides the possible classes and ratings to be used to establish the terms of approval of the certificate of the organisation approved in accordance with Annex II (Part-145). An organisation must be granted terms of approval that range from a single class and rating with limitations to all classes and ratings with limitations.
(b)
In addition to the table in point (l), each maintenance organisation is required to indicate its scope of work in its MOE.
(c)
Within the approval classes and ratings established by the CAA, the scope of work specified in the MOE defines the exact limits of its approval. It is therefore essential that the approval classes and ratings and the organisation’s scope of work match.
(d)
A “category A class rating” means that the maintenance organisation may carry out maintenance on aircraft and components (including engines, auxiliary power units (APUs) or both), in accordance with the aircraft maintenance data or, if agreed by the CAA, in accordance with the component maintenance data, only while such components are fitted to the aircraft. Nevertheless, such an A-rated maintenance organisation may temporarily remove a component for maintenance in order to improve access to that component, except when its removal generates the need for additional maintenance that the organisation is not approved to perform. Such removal of component for maintenance by A-rated maintenance organisation must be subject to an appropriate control procedure in the MOE. The limitation column must specify the scope of such maintenance in order to indicate the extent of the approval.
(e)
Category A class ratings are subdivided into “Base” or “Line” maintenance categories. Such an organisation may be approved for either “Base” or “Line” maintenance, or both. It should be noted that a “Line” facility located at a main base facility requires a “Line” maintenance approval.
(f)
A “category B class rating” means that the maintenance organisation may carry out maintenance on uninstalled engines, APUs and engines, APU components or a combination of them, in accordance with the engine or APU maintenance data or both, or, if agreed by the CAA, in accordance with the component maintenance data, only while such components are fitted to the engine, the APU or both. Nevertheless, such a B-rated approved maintenance organisation may temporarily remove a component for maintenance in order to improve access to that component, except when its removal generates the need for additional maintenance that the organisation is not approved to perform. The limitation column must specify the scope of such maintenance, thereby indicating the extent of the approval. A maintenance organisation that is approved with a category B class rating may also carry out maintenance on an installed engine during aircraft base and line maintenance, provided that an appropriate control procedure in the MOE has been approved by the CAA. The scope of work in the MOE must reflect those activities if they are permitted by the CAA.
(g)
A “category C class rating” means that the maintenance organisation may carry out maintenance on uninstalled components (excluding complete engines and APUs) that are intended to be fitted on the aircraft or the engine or APU. The limitation column must specify the scope of such maintenance, thereby indicating the extent of the approval. A maintenance organisation that is approved with a category C class rating may also carry out maintenance on an installed component (other than a complete engine or APU) during aircraft base and line maintenance, or at an engine or APU maintenance facility provided that an appropriate control procedure in the MOE has been approved by the CAA. The scope of work in the MOE must reflect those activities if they are permitted by the CAA.
(h)
A “category D class rating” means a self-contained class rating that is not necessarily related to a specific aircraft, engine or other component. The D1 – Non-Destructive Testing (“NDT”) rating is only necessary for a maintenance organisation that carries out NDT as a particular task for another organisation. A maintenance organisation that is approved with a class rating in the A, B or C category may carry out NDT on products that it maintains without the need for a D1 class rating provided that the MOE contains appropriate NDT procedures.
(i)
The limitation column is intended to give the CAA the flexibility to customise an approval for any particular organisation. Ratings may only be mentioned on the approval if they are appropriately limited. The table in point (l) specifies the types of limitations that are possible. It is acceptable to stress in the limitation column the maintenance task rather than the type or manufacturer of the aircraft or engine, if that is more appropriate to the organisation (an example could be avionics systems installations and the related maintenance). If that is mentioned in the limitation column, it indicates that the maintenance organisation is approved to carry out maintenance up to and including that particular type or task.
(j)
When reference is made to the series, type and group in the limitation column of class A and B, it must be understood as follows:
“series” means a specific type series such as the Airbus 300, 310, 319, the Boeing 737-300 series, RB211-524 series, Cessna 150, Cessna 172, Beech 55 series or the Continental O-200 series;
“type” means a specific type or model such as the Airbus 310-240 type, the RB 211-524 B4 type, or the Cessna 172RG type. Any number of series or types may be quoted;
“group” means, for example, Cessna single piston engine aircraft or Lycoming non-supercharged piston engines, etc.
(k)
By way of derogation from point 145.A.85(a)(1), where a component capability list is used that could be subject to frequent amendments, then the organisation may propose to include such amendments in the procedure referred to in point 145.A.85(c) for changes not requiring prior approval.

At 12.00 p.m. on 30th May 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to retained EU law in the field of aviation safety, specifically to implementing rules, using powers conferred by Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of 4 July 2018 on common rules in the field of civil aviation.
Regulations 2 to 11 amend Commission Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 (initial airworthiness) to implement International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) standards set out in Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention of 7th December 1944. These require organisations designing or producing aircraft, engines and components to implement a Safety Management System (“SMS”) and make a number of amendments to detailed technical requirements set out in the Regulation. In particular they introduce a requirement for organisations holding a type-certificate for a product or part to produce a standardised set of instructions on maintaining it to ensure continued airworthiness, and an alleviation from certain requirements for new aircraft parts where the Civil Aviation Authority (“the CAA”) determines there is no impact on safety; they also align the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 to provisions regarding ageing aircraft introduced by Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/640 (airworthiness specifications).
Regulations 12 to 31 amend Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 (continuing airworthiness) to require maintenance organisations to implement an SMS to bring into effect ICAO standards set out in Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention. These changes mirror those mentioned above in relation to Commission Regulation (EU) 748/2012 on initial airworthiness.
Regulation 32 amends Articles 3b and 3c of Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/395 (“the Balloons Regulation”). It extends the date in Article 3b of the Balloons Regulation, by which a balloon licence issued by the CAA under the Air Navigation Order 2016 (S.I. 2016/765) must be replaced with a balloon licence (BPL) issued in accordance with the Balloons Regulation, from 8th December 2023 to 30th September 2025. It also extends the deadline in Article 3c of the Balloons Regulation, by which training for the issue of a balloon licence must have been commenced to be credited towards the issue of a BPL, from 8th December 2023 to 30th September 2025.
Regulation 33 amends Articles 3b and 3c of Commission Regulation (EU) 2018/1976 (“the Sailplanes Regulation”). It extends the date in Article 3b of the Sailplanes Regulation by which a sailplane certificate issued by the British Gliding Association (BGA) must be replaced with a sailplane licence (SPL) issued in accordance with the Sailplanes Regulation, from 8th December 2023 to 30th September 2025. It also extends the deadline in Article 3c of the Sailplanes Regulation, by which training for the issue of a sailplane certificate must have been commenced in order to be credited towards the issue of an SPL under the Sailplanes Regulation, from 8th December 2023 to 30th September 2025.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument. However a De Minimis Assessment was conducted and no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. The changes contained in this instrument were subject to separate impact assessments carried out during consultation by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. The consultation documents containing the impact assessments can be found at https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/notices-of-proposed-amendment/npa-2019-05. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends to the Bailiwick of Guernsey, with modifications, the Civil Aviation (Investigation of Air Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/321) (“the 2018 Regulations”).
Subject to the transitional provisions in article 3, this Order revokes the Civil Aviation (Investigation of Air Accidents and Incidents) (Guernsey) Order 1998 (S.I. 1998/1503).
The 2018 Regulations as modified and extended to the Bailiwick of Guernsey by this Order (“the modified Regulations”), make provision for the investigation of air accidents and incidents which occur in or over the Bailiwick of Guernsey.
The modified Regulations also make provision for a safety investigation to be conducted (insofar as it is practicable to do so) where an accident or serious incident occurs in or over a country or territory other than the Bailiwick of Guernsey or any State which is party to the Chicago Convention. Regulation 11 of the modified Regulations applies where the accident or serious incident involves an aircraft in respect of which the Bailiwick is the territory in respect of which the United Kingdom is the State of Registry, the State of the Operator, the State of Design or the State of Manufacture (as defined in regulation 11 of the modified Regulations) and where an investigation is not conducted by a State which is party to the Chicago Convention.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument because the territorial extent of the instrument and the modified Regulations is the Bailiwick of Guernsey; no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sector in the United Kingdom.

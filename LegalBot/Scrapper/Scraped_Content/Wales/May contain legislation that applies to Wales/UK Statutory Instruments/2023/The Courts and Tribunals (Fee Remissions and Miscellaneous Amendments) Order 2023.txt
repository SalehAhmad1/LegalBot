(2) The applicable threshold is—
(a)
£1,420, for a party that is single and has no children;

Step 3
Add together the amounts calculated at Step 2 (if there are two or more such amounts).
Subject to sub-paragraph (6), the result is the amount payable.

Part of excess income Rate
Up to and including £1,000 50%
£1,001 to £2,000 70%
£2,001 to £3,000 90%

“Gross monthly income— passporting benefits
11A.—(1) If a party satisfies the disposable capital test, no fee is payable under this Order if, at the time when the fee would otherwise be payable, the party is in receipt of any passporting benefits.

pension credit (Guarantee Credit); and
(e)
universal credit with additional gross annual earnings of less than £6,000.”.

12.  No remission is available if a party’s gross monthly income exceeds the applicable threshold determined in accordance with paragraph 11(2), plus the sum of £3,000.”.
(13) For paragraph 13 (gross monthly income) substitute—
“Gross monthly income
13.—(1) Subject to paragraph 14, “gross monthly income” means the total sum of—
(a)
the lower of—
(i)
the gross amount that has been earned by the party in the month immediately preceding that in which the application for remission is made; or
(ii)
the average of the gross amount that has been earned by the party in the three months immediately preceding that in which the application for remission is made, and
(b)
the gross amount received by the party from any other source in the month immediately preceding that in which the application for remission is made, other than receipt of any of the excluded benefits.
(2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), earnings from a trade, business or gainful occupation other than an occupation at a wage or salary are calculated as the lower of—
(a)
the party’s net profits for the month preceding that in which the application for remission is made; or
(b)
the average of the party’s net profits for the three months preceding that in which the application for remission is made.
(3) In sub-paragraph (2), “net profits” means the profits which have accrued to the party less all sums necessarily expended to earn those profits.”.
(14) In paragraph 15 (application for remission of a fee)—

“(5) The Lord Chancellor may by written notice request such additional information or evidence as is required to assess the party’s entitlement to fee remission under this Order, and the period specified by such notice must not be less than 7 days, beginning with the day after the date on which the notice is sent.
(6) An application for remission of a fee may be treated as abandoned and no further action taken, if a party fails to provide the information requested under sub-paragraph (5) within the period specified by that notice, or such other extended period as may be agreed in writing at the Lord Chancellor’s discretion.”.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes amendments to the fee remissions system for courts and tribunals as provided in the following Fees Orders—
the Non-Contentious Probate Fees Order 2004
the Gender Recognition (Application Fees) Order 2006
the Court of Protection Fees Order 2007
the Civil Proceedings Fees Order 2008
the Family Proceedings Fees Order 2008
the Magistrates’ Courts Fees Order 2008
the Supreme Court Fees Order 2009
the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber) Fees Order 2009
the First-tier Tribunal (Gambling) Fees Order 2010
the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum) (Judicial Review) (England and Wales) Fees Order 2011
the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Fees Order 2011
the First-tier Tribunal (Property Chamber) Fees Order 2013
Eligibility for remission or part remission of a fee is determined against the disposable capital test and the gross monthly income test.
Articles 2(3), 3(3)(b), 4(3) and 5(3) amend the disposable capital test to replace the current ten-band system with a simplified three-band structure and increase the lower disposable capital threshold from £3,000 to £4,250. As the size of a fee increases above £1,421 the applicable disposable capital threshold increases at a multiplier of three times the level of the fee payable, up to a maximum disposable capital threshold of £16,000. A party who satisfies the disposable capital test will be considered against the gross monthly income test, which will determine if a party will receive full fee remission, pay the fee in full or in part.
Articles 2(4)(b), 3(3)(c)(ii), 4(4)(b) and 5(4)(b) raise the ‘age cap’ from 61 to 66 years old. The ‘age cap’ provides that a party or their partner aged 66 or over satisfies the disposable capital test if they have less than £16,000 as disposable capital.
Articles 2(5), 3(3)(d), 4(5) and 5(5) amend the definition of ‘disposable capital’ to refer to a party’s savings and investments.
Articles 2(9), 3(3)(h), 4(9) and 5(9) update the list of capital that is disregarded (‘excluded disposable capital’) for the purposes of the disposable capital test. Household furniture, articles of personal clothing and tools and implements of trade are removed from the list of excluded disposable capital. In addition, the list is amended to include payments received from specified compensation schemes.
Articles 2(10), 3(3)(i), 4(10) and 5(10) amend the gross monthly income test. The gross monthly income test applies a series of applicable thresholds to a party. The applicable threshold for a party is determined by reference to their household composition. The applicable threshold for a party who is single with no children is £1,420, with an additional £710 applied to this threshold for a couple. If a party has children an additional £710 is applied for each child aged 14 or over, and a further £425 applied for each child aged 13 or below. A party whose gross monthly income falls below the applicable threshold will receive full fee remission.
Articles 2(11), 3(3)(j), 4(11) and 5(11) further amend the gross monthly income test to provide that a party who receives any ‘passporting benefits’ as defined by this Order automatically satisfies the gross monthly income test and will be eligible for full fee remission.
Articles 2(12), 3(3)(k), 4(12) and 5(12) amend the gross monthly income cap. A party with income in excess of £3,000 above the applicable threshold will not be eligible for any remission.
Articles 2(13), 3(3)(l), 4(13) and 5(13) amend the definition of ‘gross monthly income’ so that it may be determined against either the party’s gross monthly earnings in the month immediately preceding the application for fee remission, or as an average of the party’s earnings in the three months immediately preceding the application for fee remission, plus any gross amount received from any other source other than excluded benefits in the month preceding the application.
Articles 2(14), 3(3)(m), 4(14) and 5(14) provide the Lord Chancellor (or the Chief Executive of the Supreme Court in the case of the Supreme Court Fees Order 2009) with the power to request further information and evidence to assess a party’s eligibility for fee remission. They further provide the Lord Chancellor (or the Chief Executive of the Supreme Court in the case of the Supreme Court Fees Order 2009) the discretion to treat an application as abandoned where a party fails to comply with the request within a specified period of time.
This Order also amends Fee 2.1(a) of the Civil Proceedings Fees Order 2008 to apply this fee to cases assigned to the new ‘intermediate track’. Prior to the introduction of the ‘intermediate track’ such cases would have been assigned to the ‘multi-track’, for which the same Fee 2.1(a) is prescribed.
Savings provisions in Article 6 preserve the current remission system for applications for remission received before 27th November 2023, including an application for a refund received on or after 27th November 2023 relating to a fee paid before 27th November 2023.
In respect of the amendments made by this Order to the fee remissions scheme, a full impact assessment was published alongside the response to the consultation ‘revising the ‘Help with Fees’ remission scheme’, and copies can be obtained on legislation.gov.uk website.
No impact assessment has been carried out for amendments to Fee 2.1(a) of the Civil Proceedings Fees Order 2008 as no, or no significant impact, on the private, voluntary, or public sectors is foreseen.

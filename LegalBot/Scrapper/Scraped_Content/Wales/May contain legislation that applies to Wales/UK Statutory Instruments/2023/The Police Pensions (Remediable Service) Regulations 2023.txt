Sch. para. 12 in force at 1.10.2023, see reg. 1(b)EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25) (“PSPA 2013”) makes provision, and confers powers to make further provision (in the form of “scheme regulations” as defined in section 1 of PSPA 2013), about the establishment of public service pension schemes. The Police Pensions Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/445) (“the 2015 Regulations”) are the scheme regulations establishing the successor police pension scheme (“the reformed scheme”) to the schemes established by the Police Pensions Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/257) and the Police Pensions Regulations 2006 (S. I. 2006/3415) (“the legacy schemes”). The 2015 Regulations provided for transitional protection for certain cohorts of legacy scheme members. Transitional protection of this sort was subsequently found to unlawfully discriminate between legacy scheme members on the basis of age.
The Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7) (“PSPJOA 2022”), at Chapter 1, makes provision, and confers powers for scheme regulations under PSPA 2013 to make further provision, in relation to specified service (“remediable service” as defined in section 1 of PSPJOA 2022) of members who benefitted from transitional protection, and of members who did not benefit from transitional protection only by reason of their age. Section 27 of PSPJOA 2022 requires certain powers to make scheme regulations to be exercised in accordance with Treasury directions.
These Regulations are scheme regulations under PSPA 2013 and in accordance with PSPJOA 2022 in relation to a member’s remediable service in a police pension scheme. They are, to the extent required by section 27 of PSPJOA 2022, made in accordance with Treasury directions under that section (in the form of the Public Service Pensions (Exercise of Powers, Compensation and Information) Directions 2022). These Regulations have retrospective effect, which is authorised by section 3(3)(b) of PSPA 2013.
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision about when and to whom a remediable service statement is to be provided by the scheme manager, as well as the contents of the remediable service statement.
Part 3 makes provision about the principal decisions that may be made in relation to a member’s remediable service—
(a)
Chapter 1 makes provision about when and how an election may be made for service in respect of which a member opted-out of a police pension scheme to be reinstated and treated as remediable service;
(b)

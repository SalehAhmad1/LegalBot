(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are the tenth commencement regulations under the Elections Act 2022 (c. 37) (“the Act”).
Regulation 2(a) commences section 4 of the Act, which inserts new section 112A into the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2). New section 112A(1) provides that a person who is a political campaigner in respect of a parliamentary election or a local government election in England commits an offence (which is a corrupt practice) if the person handles a postal voting document that has been issued to another person for use in that election. New section 112A(2) to (4) provides certain defences to that offence. Section 112A(7) defines “political campaigner”.
Regulation 2(b) commences the remainder of section 5 of the Act. Section 5 makes amendments to the conduct rules for parliamentary elections (which are contained in Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983) to allow admission to polling stations for persons who are handing in postal voting documents, and to ensure that handed in postal voting documents which have been rejected in accordance with relevant provisions regulating the handing in of postal voting documents are not classed as duly returned.
Regulation 2(c) commences section 7 of the Act, which amends section 66 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 to extend the requirement of secrecy to information contained in, and the completion of, postal ballot papers, and to limit the communication of such information by any person who has undertaken to assist a voter who is blind, disabled or is unable to read in voting.
Regulation 2(d) commences section 12 of, and Schedule 6 to, the Act in part, to the extent to which Schedule 6 makes equivalent provision to that made by sections 4, 5 and 7 of the Act in respect of local elections in Northern Ireland and elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

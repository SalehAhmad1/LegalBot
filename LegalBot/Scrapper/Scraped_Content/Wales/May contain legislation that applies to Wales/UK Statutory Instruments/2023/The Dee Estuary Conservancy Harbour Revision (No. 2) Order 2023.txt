The Dee Estuary Conservancy Harbour Revision (No. 2) Order 2023
Made
21st June 2023
Coming into force
12th July 2023
The Natural Resources Body for Wales is the conservancy authority, harbour authority and local lighthouse authority for the estuary of the river Dee(1) and has applied for a harbour revision order in accordance with section 14 of the Harbours Act 1964(2) (“the 1964 Act”).
There were objections made to the application which were not withdrawn, and an inquiry was held in accordance with paragraph 18(1) of Schedule 3 to the 1964 Act(3).
The Secretary of State has considered the objections made and not withdrawn and the report of the person holding the inquiry.
The Secretary of State is satisfied as mentioned in section 14(2)(b) of the 1964 Act.
The Secretary of State for Transport, being the appropriate Minister(4) under section 14(7) of the 1964 Act, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 14(1), (2A) and (3) of the 1964 Act and now vested in the Secretary of State for Transport(5), makes the following Order.
(1)
The functions of conservancy authority and harbour authority were conferred on the Dee Conservancy Board by sections 35 and 36 of the Dee Conservancy Act 1889 (c. clvi) and subsequently transferred to the River Dee Catchment Board. That Board was, by virtue of the Rivers Dee and Clwyd Catchment Area Order 1946 (S.I. 1946/1036) combined with the River Clwyd Catchment Board to form the Rivers Dee and Clwyd Catchment Board; this was replaced by the Dee and Clwyd River Board by virtue of the Dee and Clwyd River Board Constitution Order 1950 (S.I 1950/1085) and, in turn, by the Dee and Clwyd River Authority by virtue of the Dee and Clwyd River Authority Constitution Order 1964 (S.I. 1964/1015). Section 2 of the Water Act 1973 (c. 37) transferred the functions of the said River Authority to the Welsh National Water Development Authority and section 142 of the Water Act 1989 (c. 15) transferred that Authority’s functions of a conservancy authority to the National Rivers Authority. Those functions were subsequently transferred to the Environment Agency by virtue of section 2(1)(a)(vi) of the Environment Act 1995 (c. 25). In relation to the functions of local lighthouse authority for the Dee Estuary, section 193(2) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 (c. 21) had the effect of conferring those functions on the National Rivers Authority as the then statutory harbour authority before they were vested in the Environment Agency, as mentioned above. The Natural Resources Body for Wales, whose head office address is located at Cambria House, 29 Newport Road, Cardiff CF24 0TP (www.naturalresources.wales), was established by the Natural Resources Body for Wales (Establishment) Order 2012 (S.I. 2012/1903 (W.230)) and the above-mentioned functions of the Environment Agency were transferred to that Body by virtue of the Natural Resources Body for Wales (Functions) Order 2013 (S.I. 2013/755 (W.90)). Mostyn Docks Limited is, however, the harbour authority for that part of the river Dee Estuary described in the Mostyn Docks Orders 1988 to 2016 (see the Mostyn Docks Harbour Revision Order 2016 (S.I. 2016/75)).
(2)
1964 c. 40; section 14 was amended by the Transport Act 1981 (c. 56), section 18 and Schedule 6, paragraphs 2 to 4(1) and (8), 14 and section 40 and Schedule 12 (Part II), by the Transport and Works Act 1992 (c. 42), section 63(1) and Schedule 3, paragraph 1, by S.I. 2006/1177, regulation 2 and the Schedule (Part I), by the Planning Act 2008 (c. 29), section 36 and Schedule 2, paragraphs 8 and 9, by S.I. 2009/1941, article 2(1) and Schedule 1, paragraph 12 and by the Criminal Justice Act 1982 (c. 48), sections 37 and 46. Section 54 (orders and regulations) was amended by the Transport Act 1981 (c. 56), sections 18 and 40 and Schedules 6 and 12 (Part II) and by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (c. 23), section 315 and Schedule 21, paragraphs 1 and 3(2).
(3)
Schedule 3, paragraph 18(1) was amended by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (c. 23), Schedule 21, paragraph 5(1) and (2).

11.—(1) In the application of the 1995 Act to the conservancy authority, section 252 (powers of harbour and conservancy authorities in relation to wrecks) of that Act has effect in relation to a vessel sunk, stranded or abandoned before as well as after the making of this Order, and any reference in that section to the Secretary of State is to be treated as a reference to the Secretary of State as defined in article 2(1).
(2) Subject to paragraph (3), and to any enactment for the time being in force limiting its liability, the conservancy authority may recover from the owner of any vessel in relation to which it has exercised its powers under section 252 of the 1995 Act any expenses reasonably incurred by it under that section in relation to that vessel which are not reimbursed out of the proceeds of sale (if any) within the meaning of those sections.
(3) Except in a case which is in the opinion of the conservancy authority a case of emergency, paragraph (2) does not apply in relation to any vessel unless, before exercising in relation to that vessel any of the powers conferred on it by section 252 of the 1995 Act, other than the power of lighting and buoying, the authority has given to the owner of the vessel not less than 48 hours’ notice of its intention to do so.
(4) If before the notice expires, the conservancy authority receives from the owner counter-notice in writing that the owner desires to dispose of the vessel itself, the owner will be at liberty to do so, and the conservancy authority must not exercise the powers in section 252 in relation to that vessel until the expiration of—
(a)
seven days from the receipt of the counter-notice, and
(b)
any further continuous period during which the owner of the vessel proceeds with the disposal of the vessel with all reasonable diligence and in compliance with any directions for the prevention of interference with navigation which may be given to the owner by the authority.
(5) A notice under paragraph (3) to the owner of a vessel may be served by the conservancy authority—
(a)
by delivering it to the owner,
(b)
by sending it to the owner by registered post or recorded delivery service, addressed to the owner at his or her last known place of business or abode in the United Kingdom, or

if the identity of the owner or any such place of business or abode is not known to the authority, or is not in the United Kingdom, by displaying the notice at such places as the authority considers appropriate for the period of duration of the notice.
(6) In this article “owner”, in relation to any vessel means, as the case may be—
(a)
the present owner, or
(b)
the person who was the owner of the vessel at the time of the sinking, stranding or abandonment of it.

make different provisions for different parts of the estuary or in relation to different classes of vessels or vehicles; and
(d)

(a)
that the offence was not caused or facilitated by any act or neglect on the part of that person or on the part of any other person engaged or employed by that person, and
(b)
if that person was at the material time the owner or master of a vessel, that all reasonable steps were taken to prevent the commission of the offence.

section 238,
of the Local Government Act 1972(1) (“the 1972 Act”) (which relate to the procedure for making, and evidence of, byelaws) apply to any byelaws made by the conservancy authority under this article as if the authority was a local authority for the purposes of the 1972 Act, other than a council for a principal area in Wales.
(6) The provisions referred to in paragraph (5), in their application to any byelaws made under this article, have effect subject to the modification that for the references to a local authority there are substituted references to the conservancy authority.
(7) Section 236(7) of the 1972 Act, in its application to any byelaws made under this article is, subject to sub-paragraph (8), to be read as if it were modified by the insertion of the words “with or without modifications” after the word “confirm” in the second place where that word occurs.

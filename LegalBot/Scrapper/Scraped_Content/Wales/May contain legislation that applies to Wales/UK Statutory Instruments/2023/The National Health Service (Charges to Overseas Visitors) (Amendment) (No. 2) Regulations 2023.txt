These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/238), which provide for the making and recovery of charges for relevant services provided under the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41) to overseas visitors (people who are not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom).
Regulation 2 adds Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, and Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands into the list of countries and territories in Schedule 2 to the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2015 meaning that no charges may be made or recovered in respect of relevant services provided to an overseas visitor where the provision of those services is covered by a healthcare agreement with those territories.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

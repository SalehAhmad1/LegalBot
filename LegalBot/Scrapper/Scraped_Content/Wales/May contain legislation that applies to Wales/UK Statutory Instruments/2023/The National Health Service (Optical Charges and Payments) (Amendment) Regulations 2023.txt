(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Optical Charges and Payments) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/461) (“the 2013 Regulations”) which make provision for payments to be made by means of vouchers to eligible persons, to meet or contribute towards costs incurred in connection with the supply, replacement and repair of optical appliances pursuant to Part 6 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41). They apply to England only.
The 2013 Regulations are amended to increase voucher values. Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 20 of the 2013 Regulations to increase the redemption value of a voucher issued for replacement of a single contact lens or repair of a frame by 4.5% overall.
Regulations 2(3) to (5) amend Schedules 1, 2 and 3 to the 2013 Regulations to increase the value of vouchers issued towards the cost of supply and replacement of glasses and contact lenses, increase the additional value of vouchers for prisms, tints, photochromic lenses and special categories of appliances and increase the value of vouchers for the cost of the repair and replacement of optical appliances. The rate of increase is 4.5% overall.
Regulation 3 is a saving provision which provides that the old values will continue to apply in relation to vouchers accepted or presented before 1st April 2023.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

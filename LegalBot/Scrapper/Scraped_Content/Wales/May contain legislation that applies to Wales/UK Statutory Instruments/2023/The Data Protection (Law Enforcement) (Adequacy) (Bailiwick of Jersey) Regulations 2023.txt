(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations specify the Bailiwick of Jersey (“Jersey”) as a third country which provides an adequate level of protection of personal data for the purposes of Part 3 (law enforcement processing) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12).
This means that personal data can be transferred by UK competent authorities to relevant authorities in Jersey (authorities with comparable law enforcement functions to a UK competent authority), which are subject to the relevant Jersey data protection legislation (specifically the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2018) without the need for any specific authorisation.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector or community bodies is foreseen.

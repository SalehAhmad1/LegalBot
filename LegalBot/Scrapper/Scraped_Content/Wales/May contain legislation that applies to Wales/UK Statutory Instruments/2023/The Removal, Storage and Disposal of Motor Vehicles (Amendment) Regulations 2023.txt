(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Police (Retention and Disposal of Vehicles) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/723) (‘the 1995 Regulations’), the Police (Retention and Disposal of Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/3049) (‘the 2002 Regulations’) and the Road Traffic Act 1988 (Retention and Disposal of Seized Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/1606) (‘the 2005 Regulations’) to enable police officers to electronically serve notices of seizure or removal of vehicles.
These Regulations also substitute regulation 9 of the 1995 Regulations including by introducing two tables of charges. Different charges are prescribed for different classes of vehicle. The first table prescribes charges for the removal of vehicles. The charge for removal previously specified in the 1995 Regulations was £105. The second table prescribes charges for the retention of vehicles. The charge for retention previously specified in the 1995 Regulations was £12 for storage for each period of 24 hours or a part thereof. The level of the new charges prescribed is an increase of 28% (based on the increase in inflation calculated by comparing the increase in GDP deflators between 2008 and 2021/2022) in the charges, prior to amendment by these Regulations, in regulations 4 and 5 of the Removal, Storage and Disposal of Vehicles (Prescribed Sums and Charges) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/2095) (‘the 2008 Regulations’).
These Regulations also amend the 2002 Regulations, the 2005 Regulations and the 2008 Regulations by providing an increase in the charges of 28% (based on the increase in inflation calculated by comparing the increase in GDP deflators between 2008 and 2021/2022). The amendments provide different fees for different classes of vehicles.

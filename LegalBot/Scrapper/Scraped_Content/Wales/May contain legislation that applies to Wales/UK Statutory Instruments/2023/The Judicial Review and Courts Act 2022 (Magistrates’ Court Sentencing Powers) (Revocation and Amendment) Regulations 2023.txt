17th October 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument is made under section 13(10) of the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (c. 35).
These regulations amend both primary and secondary legislation to correct drafting errors in the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (Magistrates’ Court Sentencing Powers) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/149). Those regulations reflected changes made by section 13 of the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 which amended section 224 of the Sentencing Act 2020 (c. 17) which specifies the maximum penalty that the magistrates’ court may impose for a summary offence and for a triable either way offence. In particular, an amendment made in error to the maximum sentence that the Crown Court may impose for the offence of failing to surrender under section 6(7) of the Bail Act 1976 (c. 63), is now corrected so that the original wording “12 months” is reinstated.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary, or public sector is foreseen.

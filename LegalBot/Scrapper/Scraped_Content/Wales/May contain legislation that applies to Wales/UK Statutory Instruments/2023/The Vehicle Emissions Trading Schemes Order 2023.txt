Calculate the “relevant percentage” for each scheme year which is—
(a)
for the 2024 scheme year, 100%
(b)
for the 2025 scheme year and the 2026 scheme year, the sum of—
(i)
the percentage shown in column 2 of the Table in Part 1 of Schedule 6 (percentage of car registrations for calculating CRTS allowances) for that scheme year;
(ii)
the percentage shown in article 15(2) (limits on borrowed CRTS allowances) for that scheme year; and
(iii)
the percentage shown in article 23(3) to (5) (limits on conversion of unused CCTS allowances into CRTS credits) for that scheme year; and
(c)
for the 2027 scheme year, the 2028 scheme year, the 2029 scheme year and the 2030 scheme year, the percentage shown in column 2 of the Table in Part 1 of Schedule 6 for that scheme year.
Step 2
Calculate the number of cars registered during the trading period by a low-volume CRTS participant or by a CRTS participant described in article 13(4) or (6).
Step 3
Calculate the total number of cars registered during the trading period, subtract from that number the number obtained at Step 2, and multiply the resulting number by the average of the relevant percentages obtained at Step 1.
Step 4
Calculate the number which is equal to 2.5% of all the cars, vans and SPVs which are registered during the trading period.
Step 5
Calculate the number of ZE SPVs of category M1 of which an SPV car manufacturer is the manufacturer, which were to be used exclusively by a car club for the provision of a car club service for a period of 18 months from the date the SPV was registered and which were registered during the trading period, and multiply that number by 0.5.
Step 6
Calculate the number of ZE SPVs of category M1 which are registered during the trading period.
Step 7
Calculate the number of ZE wheelchair accessible SPVs which are registered during the trading period and multiply that number by 0.5.
Step 8
Add together the numbers which result from Steps 2 to 7.Allocation of CRTS allowances

(14) Where a decision by a CRTS participant not to account for borrowed CRTS allowances for a scheme year would result in the participant having banked CRTS allowances standing in its name in the registry for the following scheme year, the CRTS participant must give a notification under paragraph (13) which relates to the number of borrowed CRTS allowances which would prevent that outcome.
(15) A borrowed CRTS allowance may not be traded under article 25.Banked allowances: pool CRTS participants
16.—(1) The administrator must transfer to a departing member its share of any banked pool allowances, calculated in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3).

Step 1
Calculate “PNZE”, which is the number of NZE cars of which the pool CRTS participant is treated as being the manufacturer in accordance with article 8(3) and which were registered during the scheme year of pooling.
Step 2
Calculate “MNZE”, which is the number of NZE cars of which the departing member is the manufacturer and which were registered during the scheme year of pooling.
Step 3
Divide MNZE by PNZE.
Step 4
The departing member’s share of the in-year borrowed allowances for a scheme year of pooling is the number of those allowances multiplied by the number obtained at step 3.
(3) A departing member must account for its share of the borrowed pool allowances in accordance with article 15(7), as if those allowances had been borrowed by the departing member for the scheme year of pooling for which they were borrowed by the pool CRTS participant.
(4) Any borrowed CRTS allowances which have not been accounted for by a joining manufacturer in accordance with article 15(7) must be so accounted for by the pool CRTS participant for the scheme years of pooling, as if those allowances had been borrowed by the pool CRTS participant for the scheme year for which they were borrowed by the joining manufacturer.
(5) The administrator must update the registry to reflect the apportionment of borrowed CRTS allowances in accordance with this article.CRTS credits: general

44.—(1) A VRTS allowance is an allowance for the registration of one NZE van.
(2) The total amount of VRTS allowances which may be allocated for the trading period is limited in accordance with article 45.
(3) The total number of units of activity in the VRTS which may be accounted for by the surrender of a VRTS allowance or a VRTS credit in accordance with article 59 for the trading period is limited to the number which results from the following calculation.
Step 1
Calculate the “relevant percentage” for each scheme year which is—
(a)
for the 2024 scheme year and the 2025 scheme year, 100%;
(b)
for the 2026 scheme year, the sum of—
(i)
the percentage shown in column 2 of the Table in Part 2 of Schedule 6 (percentage of van registrations for calculating VRTS allowances) for that scheme year;

for the 2027 scheme year, the 2028 scheme year, the 2029 scheme year and the 2030 scheme year, the percentage shown in column 2 of the Table in Part 2 of Schedule 6 for that scheme year.
Step 2
Calculate the number of vans registered during the trading period by a low-volume VRTS participant or by a VRTS participant described in article 45(4) or (6).
Step 3
Calculate the total number of vans registered during the trading period, subtract from that number the number obtained at Step 2, and multiply the resulting number by the average of the relevant percentages obtained at Step 1.
Step 4
Calculate the number which is equal to 2.5% of all the cars, vans and SPVs which are registered during the trading period.
Step 5
Calculate the number of ZE SPVs of category N1, and ZE SPVs of category N2 which are within the description in paragraph (c) of the definition of “van” in article 3(1), of which an SPV van manufacturer is the manufacturer, which were to be used exclusively by a car club for the provision of a car club service for a period of 18 months from the date the SPV was registered and which were registered during the trading period, and multiply that number by 0.5.
Step 6
Calculate the number of ZE SPVs of category N1, or of category N2 which fall within the description in paragraph (c) of the definition of “van” in article 3(1), which are registered during the trading period.
Step 7
Add together the numbers which result from Steps 2 to 6.Allocation of VRTS allowances
45.—(1) The administrator must allocate VRTS allowances in accordance with paragraphs (2) to (7) and subject to paragraph (8).

(4) Paragraph (5) applies for the purpose of calculating the number of VRTS allowances to be allocated to a VRTS participant where—
(a)
the VRTS participant is not a low-volume VRTS participant for the scheme year for which the calculation is made (referred to in this paragraph and in paragraph (5) as “the transition year”);
(b)
the VRTS participant was a low-volume VRTS participant for the scheme year immediately preceding the transition year; and
(c)
the transition year is not the 2030 scheme year.
(5) Where this paragraph applies, the administrator must allocate to the VRTS participant a number of VRTS allowances for the transition year which is equal to the higher of—

(6) A VRTS participant may borrow VRTS allowances which are due to be allocated to it for the 2025 scheme year, the 2026 scheme year or the 2027 scheme year and must account for any borrowed allowances in accordance with the following paragraphs of this article.
(7) Where a VRTS participant borrows a number of VRTS allowances to surrender for a scheme year, the participant must surrender an equivalent number of VRTS allowances or VRTS credits for the following scheme year or a subsequent scheme year, together with an additional number of VRTS allowances or VRTS credits, calculated in accordance with paragraphs (8) to (11).
(8) If the VRTS participant accounts for the borrowed allowances for the scheme year which follows immediately after the scheme year for which the borrowed allowances were surrendered, the VRTS participant must surrender—
(a)
a number of VRTS allowances or VRTS credits which is equal to the number of borrowed allowances; and
(b)
an additional number of VRTS allowances or VRTS credits which amounts to 3.5% of the number of borrowed allowances.
(9) If the VRTS participant accounts for the borrowed allowances for a scheme year which begins one year after the end of the scheme year for which the borrowed allowances were surrendered, the VRTS participant must surrender—

(13) Where a VRTS participant decides to account for borrowed VRTS allowances for a scheme year earlier than the 2027 scheme year, that participant must notify the administrator of its decision, before the end of the trading window which follows the scheme year for which the participant intends to account for the allowances.
(14) Where a decision by a VRTS participant not to account for borrowed VRTS allowances for a scheme year would result in the participant having banked VRTS allowances standing in its name in the registry for the following scheme year, the VRTS participant must give a notification under paragraph (13) which relates to the number of borrowed VRTS allowances which would prevent that outcome.
(15) A borrowed VRTS allowance may not be traded under article 57.Banked allowances: pool VRTS participants
48.—(1) The administrator must transfer to a departing member its share of any banked pool allowances, calculated in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3).
(2) The departing member’s share of the banked pool allowances is the number which results from adding together the departing member’s share of the in-year banked allowances for each of the scheme years of pooling during which it was a member of the pool VRTS participant, calculated in accordance with paragraph (3).
(3) The departing member’s share of the in-year banked allowances for a scheme year of pooling is calculated as follows.
Step 1
Calculate “PZE”, which is the number of ZE vans of which the pool VRTS participant is treated as being the manufacturer in accordance with article 8(3) and which were registered during the scheme year of pooling.
Step 2
Calculate “MZE”, which is the number of ZE vans of which the departing member is the manufacturer and which were registered during the scheme year of pooling.
Step 3
Divide MZE by PZE.
Step 4
The departing member’s share of the in-year banked allowances for a scheme year of pooling is the number of those allowances multiplied by the number obtained at step 3.
(4) A departing member may use its share of the banked pool allowances in accordance with article 46, as if those allowances had been allocated to it for the scheme year of pooling for which they were allocated to the pool VRTS participant.
(5) Any banked VRTS allowances which remain available for use in accordance with article 46 by a joining manufacturer may be used by the pool VRTS participant in accordance with article 46 for the scheme years of pooling, as if those allowances had been allocated to the pool VRTS participant for the scheme year for which they were allocated to the joining manufacturer.
(6) The administrator must update the registry to reflect the apportionment of banked pool allowances in accordance with this article.Borrowed allowances: pool VRTS participants
49.—(1) A departing member’s share of the borrowed pool allowances is the number of VRTS allowances which results from adding together the departing member’s share of the in-year borrowed allowances for each of the scheme years of pooling during which it was a member of the pool VRTS participant, calculated in accordance with paragraph (2).
(2) The departing member’s share of the in-year borrowed allowances for a scheme year of pooling is calculated as follows.
Step 1
Calculate “PNZE”, which is the number of NZE vans of which the pool VRTS participant is treated as being the manufacturer in accordance with article 8(3) and which were registered during the scheme year of pooling.
Step 2
Calculate “MNZE”, which is the number of NZE vans of which the departing member is the manufacturer and which were registered during the scheme year of pooling.
Step 3
Divide MNZE by PNZE.
Step 4
The departing member’s share of the in-year borrowed allowances for a scheme year of pooling is the number of those allowances multiplied by the number obtained at step 3.
(3) A departing member must account for its share of the borrowed pool allowances in accordance with article 47(7), as if those allowances had been borrowed by it for the scheme year of pooling for which they were borrowed by the pool VRTS participant.
(4) Any borrowed VRTS allowances which have not been accounted for by a joining manufacturer in accordance with article 47(7) must be so accounted for by the pool VRTS participant for the scheme years of pooling, as if those allowances had been borrowed by the pool VRTS participant for the scheme year for which they were borrowed by the joining manufacturer.
(5) The administrator must update the registry to reflect the apportionment of borrowed VRTS allowances in accordance with this article.VRTS credits: general
50.—(1) A VRTS participant may acquire a VRTS credit in accordance with articles 51, 52 and 55.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under sections 44, 46(3), 54 and 90(3) of, and Parts 1 and 3 of Schedule 2 and paragraph 9 of Schedule 3 to, the Climate Change Act 2008 (c. 27). It establishes four new trading schemes which limit, or encourage the limitation of, CO2 emissions resulting from the registration of new cars and light commercial vehicles (vans). Two of the schemes apply to cars: the Non-Zero-Emission Car Registration Trading Scheme (“CRTS”) and the Non-Zero-Emission Car CO2 Trading Scheme (“CCTS”), and two apply to vans: the Non-Zero-Emission Van Registration Trading Scheme (“VRTS”) and the Non-Zero-Emission Van CO2 Trading Scheme (“VCTS”). They are collectively referred to as “the Trading Schemes”, and apply in Great Britain.
Part 1 contains definitions that are used throughout the Order, including key concepts such as “car” and “van”, the “trading period” (the date the Order comes into force to 31st December 2030), “scheme year”, “trading window” (the period from 1st November to 31st December following a scheme year), “specific emissions of CO2”, “registration”, “NZE” (non-zero-emission) and “ZE” (zero-emission). Part 2 establishes the Trading Schemes (article 4) and makes some general provision in relation to the schemes and their administration.
Chapter 1 of Part 3 contains provisions which are specific to the CRTS. This trading scheme applies to the activity of registering NZE cars, measured by reference to the number of such cars registered (article 10). The manufacturer of a car which is registered during a scheme year, or a group of such manufacturers, is a CRTS participant (article 11). CRTS allowances are allocated by the administrator according to the proportion of a participant’s new car registrations which may be NZE cars (article 13 and Part 1 of Schedule 6). Participants may acquire credits in relation to activities that represent a reduction in CO2 emissions, subject to limits (articles 18 to 20 and 23). Certain credits may also be acquired by non-participants which manufacture special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) (articles 21 and 22). CRTS participants may trade CRTS allowances and credits with other CRTS participants during the trading window, and may acquire credits from SPV manufacturers, following which they must account for their activity during a scheme year by surrendering CRTS allowances or credits (article 27). Failure to do so results in an obligation to make a payment of £15,000 for each unit of unaccounted for activity (article 28).
Chapter 2 of Part 3 contains provisions which are specific to the CCTS. This trading scheme applies to the activity of registering NZE cars, measured by reference to each gram of CO2 emitted by such cars (article 31). The manufacturer of 1,000 or more NZE cars which are registered during a scheme year, or a group of such manufacturers, is a CCTS participant (article 32). CCTS allowances are allocated by the administrator according to the number of NZE car registrations attributable to the participant, multiplied by that participant’s baseline CO2 emissions, calculated in accordance with Schedule 1. Activity in the CCTS is measured by reference to a car’s specific emissions of CO2, reduced by any CO2 savings from eco-innovations (article 36). Trading CCTS allowances is permitted in the trading window (article 37) and activity in each scheme year must be accounted for by surrendering CCTS allowances (article 38). CCTS participants must make a payment of £86 for each unit of unaccounted for activity (article 39).
Chapter 3 of Part 3 contains provisions which are specific to the VRTS. These provisions replicate the CRTS in relation to vans, with certain differences. These differences relate to matters such as the proportion of a VRTS participant’s new van sales which may be NZE vans (Part 2 of Schedule 6), and the payment amount for a unit of activity which is unaccounted for in the VRTS (usually £18,000, article 60).
Chapter 4 of Part 3 contains provisions which are specific to the VCTS. These provisions replicate the CCTS in relation to vans. Activity in the VCTS is measured in the same way as in the CCTS, although there is provision to assess the specific emissions of CO2 of vans which are manufactured in two or more stages (Schedule 3).
Part 4 contains provision about information required for the purposes of the Trading Schemes. Part 5 includes powers to enable the administrator to monitor compliance with the Order. Part 6 includes a range of civil penalties that may be imposed in respect of specified breaches of the Order. Part 7 contains provision about appeals from decisions made by the administrator to the First-tier Tribunal. Part 8 deals with the retained EU law governing the CO2 emission limits of new cars and vans which the Trading Schemes build on and replace for Great Britain, and which remains in place, with consequential amendments, for Northern Ireland.
An impact assessment (in the form of a cost benefit analysis) of the effect that the Trading Schemes will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Department for Transport, Great Minster House, 33 Horseferry Road, London SW1P 4DR, and is available alongside the instrument and the Explanatory Memorandum on www.legislation.gov.uk.

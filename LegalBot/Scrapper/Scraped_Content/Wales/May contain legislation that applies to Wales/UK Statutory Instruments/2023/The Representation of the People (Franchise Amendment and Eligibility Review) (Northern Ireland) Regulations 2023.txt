30th October 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision related to the change in franchise for citizens of the European Union for local government elections in Northern Ireland.
Part 2 provides, at Chapter 2, a process for the review of the entitlement of citizens of member States of the European Union to remain registered on the register of local electors in Northern Ireland following the change in registration criteria in section 4 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2).
Part 3 provides for a revised date by which the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland must publish under section 13 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 revised versions of the Officer’s electoral registers for 2024.
Part 4 makes amendments to the Representation of the People (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/1741) regarding the content of applications for registration on the register of local electors in Northern Ireland, and the marking of certain entries in registers to indicate that an EU citizen is registered only in the register of local electors.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument, and the corresponding instrument for local and Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England, will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities at 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF and published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

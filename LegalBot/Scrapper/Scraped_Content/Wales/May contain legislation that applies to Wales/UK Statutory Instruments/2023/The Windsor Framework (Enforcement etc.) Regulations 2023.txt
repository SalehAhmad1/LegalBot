S.I. 2008/3206.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement the Windsor Framework(1) in respect of enforcement.
Part 2 implements enforcement provisions in respect of the movement of plants under the Windsor Framework.
Part 3 applies Northern Ireland enforcement provisions in respect of public health, marketing and organic products standards. These provisions are relevant where standards applicable in Great Britain are applied to consignments of retail agri-food goods moving under the Retail Movement Scheme to the extent that EU public health, marketing and organic products standards listed in Annex 1 to the SPS Regulation are disapplied by virtue of Article 1(2) and Chapter 2 of that Regulation. The SPS Regulation allows retail agri-food goods, plants, seed potatoes and other items to move from Great Britain to Northern Ireland without undergoing checks in relation to EU standards which would otherwise apply.
A full impact assessment has not been published for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

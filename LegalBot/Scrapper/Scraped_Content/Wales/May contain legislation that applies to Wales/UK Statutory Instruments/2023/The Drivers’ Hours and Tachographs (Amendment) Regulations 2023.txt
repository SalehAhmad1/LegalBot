(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend definitions of certain tachographs by reference to recently updated standards, and make modifications for these purposes to Annex IC of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/799, to facilitate compliant domestic and cross-border operations.
In addition, these Regulations alter implementation dates for a smart tachograph 1 or smart tachograph 2 in certain circumstances.
Regulation 2 amends Regulation (EU) No 2014/165 to—
(a)
amend Article 2 to update the definition of “smart tachograph 2” to provide for a ‘transitional’ smart tachograph 2;
(b)
amend Article 3 to—
(i)
allow a smart tachograph 1 to be fitted and used in certain vehicles first registered on or before 20th February 2024 when operating domestically; and
(ii)
delay the requirement for a smart tachograph 2 to be fitted and used in certain vehicles operating domestically to only those vehicles first registered on or after 21st February 2024.
(c)
amend Article 8 to—
(i)
update the date from which certain tachographs must be connected to a positioning service based on a satellite navigation system; and
(ii)
ensure the date from which a smart tachograph 2 is required, as it applies to vehicles operating domestically, is consistently presented;
(d)
amend Article 9 to update the date from which certain tachographs must be able to remotely communicate with the competent control authorities;
(e)
amend Article 10 to update the conditions for the use of standardised interfaces.
Regulation 3 introduces the Schedule of modifications.
Regulation 4 provides for the Secretary of State to undertake a review of the regulatory provisions contained in these Regulations firstly after three years, and then on a five yearly basis after that.
The Schedule makes modifications to Annex IC to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/799 necessary for the interpretation of the standards referred to in the definition of “smart tachograph 2”.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

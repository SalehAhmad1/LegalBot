(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/2920) (“the 2012 Fees Regulations”).
All existing fees payable to local planning authorities under the 2012 Fees Regulations are increased in respect of applications made, or deemed to be made, on or after these Regulations coming into force. Fees to be paid in respect of applications, deemed applications, requests or site visits relating to major development are increased by 35%. All other existing fees are increased by 25%.
A new provision is added to the 2012 Fees Regulations so that, from 1st April 2025, all fees under those Regulations can be increased annually (new regulation 18A). The amount of any increase will be in line with inflation, or if lower, 10%.
Further amendments are made to the 2012 Fees Regulations to remove the exemptions from fees for repeat applications and to introduce a fee for an application under Part 19 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Development) (England) Order 2015. In addition, provision is made so that where the statutory determination period for a planning application is 8 weeks, a refund of any fee paid may be obtained, under regulation 9A, if the application is not determined within 16 weeks and an extension of time has not been agreed with the applicant.
These Regulations also make related savings provisions, and other minor amendments to the 2012 Fees Regulations.
A full regulatory impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business and the voluntary sector is available from the Planning – Development Management Division, Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, Third Floor, Fry Building, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF, and is annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum which is available alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Sywell Aerodrome,

Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in 
the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(a), a fly-in booking slot can be made 
online at the event website (www.aeroexpo.co.uk).

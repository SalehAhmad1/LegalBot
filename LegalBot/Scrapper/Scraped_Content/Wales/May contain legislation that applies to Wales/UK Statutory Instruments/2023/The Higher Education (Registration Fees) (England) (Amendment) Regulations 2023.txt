The register is maintained by the Office for Students under section 3 of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (c. 29). By virtue of regulation 1(3), the increase applies to the amount of the ongoing fee payable by an institution on or after 1st August 2023.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations because no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

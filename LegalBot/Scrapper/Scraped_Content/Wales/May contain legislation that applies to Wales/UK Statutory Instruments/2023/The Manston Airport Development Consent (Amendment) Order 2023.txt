22nd September 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Manston Airport Development Consent Order 2022 (“the 2022 Order”), a development consent order under the Planning Act 2008 (“the Act”).
This Order follows an application under paragraph 2 of the Schedule 6 to the Act for a non-material change to allow an alteration to the amount of funds to be available before the use of compulsory acquisition powers, to reflect the significantly reduced compulsory acquisition powers.
It also corrects a drafting error in article 21 to make clear that the 1 year period only starts to run from the expiry of the challenge period, or the final determination of any challenge to the 2022 Order.

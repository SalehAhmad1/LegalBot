any particular details of a fixed price contract other than the price-fix date.
(4) Where the methodology provides, in relation to a category of supply contract, for more than one reference wholesale price to be determined—
(a)
subject to paragraph (b), the methodology must provide for how it is to be determined which of those reference wholesale prices applies to any particular supply contract in that category;
(b)
in relation to a DAI price contract, the methodology may provide for different reference wholesale prices to apply in different periods.

Reg. 9 in force at 26.4.2023, see reg. 1(1)Reference wholesale price – flexible price contracts
10.—(1) In relation to a flexible price contract, the reference wholesale price for any period in which energy is supplied (a “relevant period”) is the volume-weighted average contracted wholesale price for the relevant period.
(2) The volume-weighted average contracted wholesale price for a relevant period is determined by reference to any of the following that apply under that contract—
(a)
any elections (and the quantities, periods and prices subject to those elections) made by the customer to fix the contracted wholesale price;
(b)
any cancellations by the customer of such an election;
(c)
any amounts (so far as relating to wholesale prices) payable by or to the customer in respect of such elections or cancellations;
(d)
any amounts payable by the customer in respect of quantities of energy in default of such elections;
(e)
the quantities, periods and prices on the basis of which the contracted wholesale price was fixed under any other mechanism under the contract;
(f)
other amounts referable to the wholesale cost of electricity in accordance with the principle in paragraph (3),
each so far as attributable to energy supplied under the contract in the relevant period.
(3) The principle is that amounts payable by the customer under the supply contract—
(a)
should be included in the contracted wholesale price where such payment has the effect of passing through to the customer a cost or risk incurred by the supplier and related to the cost of wholesale energy;
(b)
should not be included in the contracted wholesale price where such amount is payable to compensate or reward the supplier for bearing, and not passing through to the customer, such a cost or risk.

(a)
establish a methodology setting out the basis on which it will determine the reference wholesale price under each flexible price contract, or each kind of flexible price contract, that it enters or has entered into;

keep the methodology under review and update it if appropriate;
(c)
maintain, in respect of each flexible price contract, the data necessary to make those determinations in accordance with the relevant methodology;
(d)
apply the relevant methodology in making those determinations.
(5) The Secretary of State may make rules about the determination (including as to what is, and what is not, to be taken into account in the determination) of volume-weighted average contracted wholesale prices in respect of flexible supply contracts in accordance with this regulation.

(3) A supplier must give notice to the customer of the determinations made under paragraph (1).
(4) The determinations in respect of a supply contract under paragraph (1) must be made and notice under paragraph (3) given by the later of the scheme introduction date and the time at which the supply contract is entered into.
(5) A supplier must apply the methodology established and updated from time to time in accordance with regulation 12 in making the determinations under paragraph (1).
(6) The Secretary of State may make rules—
(a)
about the basis on which it is to be determined whether a supply contract is a fixed price contract, a variable price contract, a flexible price contract or a DAI price contract;
(b)
about the basis on which the price-fix date of a fixed price contract is to be determined;
(c)
specifying circumstances in which a supply contract must be treated for the purposes of the scheme as comprising, as to different portions of the energy supplied under it, more than one contract, and, for these purposes, the two or more contracts which it is to be treated as comprising may be of the same or different categories referred to in paragraph 1(a).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in Northern Ireland, establish the Energy Bills Discount Scheme for Non-Domestic Customers in Northern Ireland (“EBDS”). EBDS is a scheme for reducing the costs, to non-domestic customers, of being supplied with electricity or gas (“energy”) by a supplier that holds a supply licence under the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 (1) or Gas (Northern Ireland) Order 1996(2).
The Regulations require suppliers to reduce, in accordance with Part 2 of the Regulations, the prices that they charge customers for energy during two “scheme periods” (the first running from 1st April 2023 to 30th September 2023 and the second from 1st October 2023 to 31st March 2024). Suppliers are entitled to recover the amount of these reductions from the Secretary of State.
Part 1 (introductory) defines key terms and parameters of EBDS. With certain exceptions, EBDS applies in respect of all contracts for the supply of energy by licensed suppliers to non-domestic customers during the scheme periods. However, the detail of its application to any given contract (including how discounts are calculated) depends on how prices are set under it, and, in some cases, on the use that is made of the energy supplied under it.
Part 2 (discounted supply price) sets out how the discounts that are to be applied by suppliers are to be calculated, based on wholesale energy prices. Chapter 1 of Part 2 sets out how the figures to be used in calculating discounts are derived. Chapter 2 of Part 2 describes how suppliers must assign each contract to the correct category based on how prices are set under it. Chapter 3 of Part 2 sets out the procedures for identifying where the energy supplied under a contract is used in certain ways, either by persons carrying out particular economic activities, or in heat networks that meet certain criteria. Where this is the case, the customers under the contracts concerned are known as “ETII” and “QHS” customers respectively. Chapter 4 of Part 2 describes how suppliers must calculate discounts for the different categories of contract and customer, reduce their charges to customers accordingly, and provide them with related information.
Part 3 (discount recovery) deals with the process by which each supplier is entitled to be paid by the Secretary of State an amount equal to the charges it has foregone in applying discounts under Part 2. In specified circumstances, the amount that a supplier receives in response to its claim for payment of an amount in respect of discounts is adjusted. Where such adjustments result in a negative sum, the customer must pay that sum (as a positive amount) to the Secretary of State. Amounts claimed by suppliers may be withheld in certain cases, for example where a supplier has acted dishonestly or failed to take proper measures to prevent fraud.
Part 4 (adjustment of discount or supply quantity in certain cases) makes provision to prevent suppliers or customers from deriving greater benefit from EBDS than is intended in certain scenarios. The Regulations provide for the benefits that customers and suppliers receive from the scheme to be reduced to take account of their entry into specified kinds of arrangements.
Part 5 (further provisions) deals with a number of different matters. Regulation 65 prohibits unreasonable increases in suppliers’ charges and other changes adverse to the customer. Regulation 66 implies terms relating to the scheme into non-domestic supply contracts. Regulations 67 to 71 impose information and reporting obligations. Regulations 72 to 76 make provision about the resolution of disputes arising from the operation of the scheme. Regulation 77 provides that specified obligations of suppliers under the regulations are enforceable by the Northern Ireland Regulator. Regulations 79 and 80 provide for the Secretary of State to impose civil penalties on those who fail to comply with certain provisions of Part 3 or Part 4. Regulation 82 provides that things done under certain provisions of the Energy Bill Relief Scheme (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2022 are to be treated as if done under corresponding provisions of the Regulations. Regulation 83 makes an amendment to regulation 34 of the Energy Bill Relief Scheme Regulations 2022(3).
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business and the voluntary sector is available from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero at 1 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0ET and is published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside the instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations impose requirements on producers who are established in England to collect data on the packaging they supply to others, and, in some cases, to report some of that information to the Environment Agency.
Part 1 (regulations 1 to 14) contains the interpretation and general provisions for the instrument. Part 2 (regulations 15 to 18) sets out the obligations on producers. Schedule 1 identifies the information which producers are required to collect and report on. Part 3 (regulations 19 to 21) makes provision for registered schemes and exempts producers who are members of a registered scheme from their data reporting obligations under these Regulations provided that they satisfy the requirements in regulation 19(2). Registered schemes are required to make reports on behalf of each of their members who satisfy these requirements. Part 3 also makes provision in relation to changes to the membership of a scheme in the middle of a relevant year.
Part 4 (regulations 22 to 27) sets out the powers and duties of the Environment Agency under these Regulations. Part 5 (regulation 28 and 29) provides for a number of offences and penalties for breach of the requirements imposed by these Regulations. It also provides for the Regulations to be reviewed every five years, in accordance with the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2016.

(This note is not part of the Order)
The Carer’s Assistance (Carer Support Payment) (Scotland) Regulations 2023 (S.S.I. 2023/302) introduce arrangements for the payment of carer’s assistance in the form of carer support payment. Carer support payment replaces carer’s allowance as the benefit paid to those in Scotland with eligible caring responsibilities for a disabled person.
This instrument makes consequential amendments to social security legislation in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as the case may be, governing entitlement to certain benefits.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

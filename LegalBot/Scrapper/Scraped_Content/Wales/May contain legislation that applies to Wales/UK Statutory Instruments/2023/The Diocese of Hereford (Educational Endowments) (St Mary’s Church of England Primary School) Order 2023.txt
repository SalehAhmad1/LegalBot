It has been shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State for Education (“the Secretary of 
State”) that the endowment of the educational foundation known as St Mary’s Church of England 
Primary School, in the county of Shropshire is or has been held in connection with the provision 
of religious education in accordance with the tenets of the Church of England at a voluntary 
school, the premises of which have ceased to be used for the purposes of such a school. 
The endowment is comprised in a deed dated 5th October 1849 and made between (1) the 
Reverend Thomas Parr and others and (2) the Rector and Churchwardens of the Parish of 
Westbury. 
The assets representing the endowment consist of: (a) £393,785 being the net proceeds of sale of 
the former school premises held on deposit at CCLA Investment Management Limited and (b) any 
income derived from those assets before the coming into force of this Order. 
Application for an order making new provision as to the use of the endowment has been made to 
the Secretary of State by the Hereford Diocesan Board of Education, which body appears to the 
Secretary of State to be the appropriate authority of the Church of England for the purpose. 
Notice of the proposed Order and of the right of persons interested to make representations on it 
has been given in the manner required by section 555(2) and (3) of the Education Act 1996(a).

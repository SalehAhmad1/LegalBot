(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for the giving of notifications by offshore workers (or their sponsors) to the Secretary of State on their arrival to the United Kingdom and when leaving the United Kingdom. Section 11A of the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77) (“the 1971 Act”) sets out the definition of “offshore workers”.
Regulation 2 sets out the requirement for an offshore worker or, if they have one, their sponsor to notify the Secretary of State of their arrival and when they leave the United Kingdom, and the timescales and method for doing so.
Guidance and other documents which make up the immigration skills arrangements between the Secretary of State and sponsors are available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/sponsorship-information-for-employers-and-educators. Written notifications can be made by emailing offshoreworkernotificationsinbox@homeoffice.gov.uk or by any other method set out by the Secretary of State in guidance published on gov.uk. Hard copies of any guidance can be requested free of charge by writing to the Economic Migration Policy Unit, Home Office, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF, United Kingdom.
Regulation 3 sets out the consequences where an offshore worker fails to comply with the notification requirements. Section 11B(3) of the 1971 Act sets out the consequences where the sponsor fails to comply with the requirements.
These Regulations also amend the Immigration (Exemption from Control) Order 1972 (S.I 1972/1613) made under section 8(2) of the 1971 Act. The effect is to exempt certain persons from the requirement to obtain leave to enter the United Kingdom. The exemption applies to those working on foreign fishing vessels which are licensed to fish in the United Kingdom’s territorial sea or Exclusive Economic Zone under section 17 of the Fisheries Act 2020, where the work is done pursuant to an international agreement or arrangement to which the UK is a party. The exemption does not apply in relation to any person on whom there is a deportation order in force, who has previously entered the United Kingdom unlawfully and has not subsequently been given leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, or to a person who is required by an immigration officer to submit to examination in accordance with Schedule 2 to the 1971 Act.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector or community bodies is foreseen.

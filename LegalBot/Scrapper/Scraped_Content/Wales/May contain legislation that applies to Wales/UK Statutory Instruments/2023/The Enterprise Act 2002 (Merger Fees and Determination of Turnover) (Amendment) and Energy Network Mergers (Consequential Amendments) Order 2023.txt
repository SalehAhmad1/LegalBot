7th November 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Part 2 of this Order amends the Enterprise Act 2002 (Merger Fees and Determination of Turnover) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/1370) (“the 2003 Order”). The 2003 Order provides for merger fees to be payable in respect of mergers that are assessed under Part 3 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (c. 40) (“the Act”). It also provides for the determination of turnover of the company being taken over, both for the purposes of assessing whether the test is met for a relevant merger which may have to be referred, and for determining the fee payable.
As a result of the amendments and modifications made to Part 3 of the Act by the Energy Act 2023 (c. 52), a special regime applies to relevant mergers between energy network enterprises. Sections 68B and 68C of the Act place a duty on the Competition and Markets Authority (“the CMA”) to refer an energy network merger to a group established by the CMA (“CMA group”) if certain conditions are met.
This Order amends the definition of “merger reference” in article 2(d) of the 2003 Order such that a reference by the CMA under section 68B or 68C of the Act is included in this definition.
This Order amends article 3(b) of the 2003 Order so that a fee is payable to the CMA in relation to the making by the CMA of a reference to a CMA group under section 68B or 68C of the Act. A new article 5(3A) is included so that the fee payable is calculated by reference to the value of the turnover in Great Britain of the energy network enterprise being taken over. A new article 5(3B) is included so that, for combined references made as described in section 68E of the Act, a fee is payable in respect of the reference made under section 22 or 33 of the Act and a separate fee is payable in respect of the reference made under section 68B or 68C of the Act.
This Order also amends article 11 of the 2003 Order so that, in respect of references made by the CMA under sections 68B and 68C of the Act, the turnover relevant to the determination under article 11 and Schedule 1 is turnover in Great Britain.
Part 3 of this Order makes amendments to the Water Mergers (Modification of Enactments) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/3202), to update references to provisions in Part 3 of the Act, in consequence of the new provisions for relevant mergers between energy network enterprises which have been added to Part 3 of the Act by the Energy Act 2023.
An impact assessment published on 7th July 2022 alongside the Energy Bill (as it was) when introduced to Parliament, contains an assessment of the impacts that the energy networks special merger regime will have on society, including costs and benefits to businesses and consumers. The impact assessment is available from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero at 3-8 Whitehall Place, London, SW1A 2EG and at https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3311/publications.

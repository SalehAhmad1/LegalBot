At 10.20 a.m. on 7th February 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments, to apply in relation to England only, to retained direct EU legislation in order to remove the framework related to public intervention (otherwise than in connection with exceptional market conditions which are the subject of a declaration under section 20 of the Agriculture Act 2020 (c. 21)), and to tailor the framework relating to private storage aid to domestic requirements.
Regulation 2 makes a minor amendment to Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 (EUR 2013/1308) in order to update a cross reference. This takes effect before regulations 3 to 11 come into force.
Part 4 of these Regulations contains a transitional provision which provides that the amendments made by regulations 3 to 9 and the revocation made by regulation 11 are of no effect in so far as they relate to an admissible offer for public intervention which is received before the coming into force of the instrument.
Part 5 of these Regulations revokes Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 906/2014 (EUR 2014/906) in relation to England.
With respect to the framework for private storage aid, the amendments made by these Regulations remove the requirement to carry out unannounced, on the spot checks during the period of storage of the product to ensure the presence and identity of the contractual quantity in the place of private storage. They also increase the minimum percentage of physical checks at the beginning and end of the storage period from 5% to 10%.
In addition, these Regulations remove the requirement for operators to lodge a security when submitting a tender or an application for aid for private storage. They also amend the requirement for tenders for private storage aid to set out the amount of proposed aid in euro, so that this is instead set out in sterling.
In respect of the products that are eligible for private storage aid, these Regulations remove the requirement for cheese to have a protected designation of origin or geographical indication in order to be eligible for private storage aid.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

20th July 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Windsor Framework requires that the European Union (“EU”) legislation listed in its Annex 2 is implemented in Northern Ireland.
One of the Directives listed in Annex 2 is Directive 2014/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres (recast) (OJ L 96, 29.3.2014, p.309) (“the ATEX Directive”).
The ATEX Directive was implemented in Northern Ireland by the Equipment and Protective Systems Intended for Use in Potentially Explosive Atmospheres Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2017 (S.R. 2017 No. 90) (“the ATEX Regulations”), whilst the United Kingdom was still a member of the EU.
These Regulations amend the ATEX Regulations to reflect that no part of the United Kingdom is part of the EU, whilst ensuring the ATEX Directive and the Windsor Framework are implemented in respect of Northern Ireland.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

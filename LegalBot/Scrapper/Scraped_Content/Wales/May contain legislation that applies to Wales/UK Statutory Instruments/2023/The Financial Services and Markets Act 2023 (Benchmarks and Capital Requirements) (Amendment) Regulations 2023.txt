19th December 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends Article 384 of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, which requires certain financial institutions to calculate a particular type of capital requirements in accordance with a specific formula. Article 384(1) defines the total counterparty credit risk exposure value (“EADi total”) for the purposes of that formula. Regulation 2 amends the definition of EADi total by inserting a discount factor which reduces the amount of capital that small and medium-sized firms are required to hold for their derivative activities under Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013.
Regulation 3 amends Article 51(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014. Regulation 3 extends the expiry date of the transitional period allowing for continued access by UK markets to third country benchmarks from 31 December 2025 to 31 December 2030. It also extends the provision which permits continued use of a legacy third country benchmark by UK markets so that, where a benchmark is used in an existing contract, financial instrument or for measuring the performance of that investment fund on 31 December 2030, it may continue to be used on and after 1 January 2031. UK supervised entities will be permitted to continue with only legacy use of third country benchmarks on and after 1 January 2031.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

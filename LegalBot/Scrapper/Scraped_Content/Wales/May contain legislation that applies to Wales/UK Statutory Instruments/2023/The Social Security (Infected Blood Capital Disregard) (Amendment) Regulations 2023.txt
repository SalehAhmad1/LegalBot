8th August 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends—
the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1967),
the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/207),
the State Pension Credit Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/1792),
the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/213),
the Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/214), and
the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/794).
A new paragraph is inserted after each of the provisions cited in regulation 2(1) of these Regulations, which will enable certain payments from an estate to be disregarded. The disregard applies to payments derived from a payment made from an approved blood scheme, or the Scottish Infected Blood Support scheme, which is to meet the recommendation of the Infected Blood Inquiry in its interim report published on 29th July 2022. That report recommended that an interim payment should be made to all those infected from contaminated blood or blood products and all bereaved partners registered on UK infected blood support schemes and those who register before the inception of any future scheme. Where an infected person or their bereaved partner registered with such a scheme but died before the interim payment could be made, it will be paid to their estate. A payment derived from an interim payment paid from the estate will be disregarded if it is made to a deceased person’s son, daughter, step-son or step-daughter.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations substitutes a new paragraph (3) into regulation 76 of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376). The substituted paragraph clarifies that, in relation to a claim to Universal Credit from a person other than a person diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease or infected from contaminated blood or blood products, a payment from a scheme established or approved by the Secretary of State, or from a trust established with funds provided by the Secretary of State to provide compensation for having been so diagnosed or infected, or a payment which derives from such a payment, is disregarded in any of the circumstances in which it would be disregarded in relation to an award of State Pension Credit.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

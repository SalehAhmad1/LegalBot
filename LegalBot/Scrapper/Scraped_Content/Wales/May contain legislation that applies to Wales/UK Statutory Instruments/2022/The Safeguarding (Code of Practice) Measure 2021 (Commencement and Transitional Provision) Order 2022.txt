27th January 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order appoints as 1st March 2022 the day on which sections 1 and 2 of the Safeguarding (Code of Practice) Measure 2021 come into force.
This Order also makes transitional provision to keep in operation any guidance made by the House of Bishops on matters relating to safeguarding children and vulnerable adults until that guidance is replaced by a code of practice under the new section 5A of the Safeguarding and Clergy Discipline Measure 2016. A failure to have due regard to any such guidance which continues in operation continues to be misconduct for the purposes of the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003.

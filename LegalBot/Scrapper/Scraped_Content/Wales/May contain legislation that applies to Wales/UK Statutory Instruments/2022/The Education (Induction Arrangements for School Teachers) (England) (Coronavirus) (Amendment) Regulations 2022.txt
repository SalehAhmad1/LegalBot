(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 8 of the Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 2012 (“the 2012 Regulations”) which sets out the circumstances in which the statutory induction period provided by those regulations can be amended before its completion. Regulation 8 of the 2012 Regulations was previously amended to allow a school teacher to complete an induction period before 1st September 2021 without it being extended due to absence from work of 30 or more days if that absence would have been less than 30 days but for a reason relating to the incidence or transmission of coronavirus.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations further amends regulation 8 by substituting a new expiry date of 1st September 2022.

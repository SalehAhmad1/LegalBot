These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of aviation safety.
Part 2 amends Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 to adopt three sets of amendments to Annex 16 (Environmental Protection) of the International Convention on Civil Aviation 1944. These relate to certification of aircraft for noise, certification of engines for emissions, and certification of aeroplanes for carbon dioxide emissions.
Part 3 amends retained direct minor EU legislation. Regulation 3 amends Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 (aircrew) to remove unnecessary transitional measures intended to transition to the Basic Instrument Rating which the UK does not currently intend to adopt.
Regulation 4 makes amendments to Commission Regulation (EU) No 2018/395 in respect of balloon licensing. The amendment in regulation 4(2) allows the holders of national pilot licences for balloons issued after 8th April 2020 to continue to fly Part-21 balloons until 8th December 2023. The amendment in regulation 4(3) allows for training undertaken for the issue of a national licence before 8th December 2023 to be credited towards the issue of a Part-BFCL licence.

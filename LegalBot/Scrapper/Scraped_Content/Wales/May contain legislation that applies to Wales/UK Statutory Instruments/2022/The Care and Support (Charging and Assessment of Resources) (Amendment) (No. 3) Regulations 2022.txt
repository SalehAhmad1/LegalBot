(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Care and Support (Charging and Assessment of Resources) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2672) (“the 2014 Regulations”). Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations lists categories of capital that must be disregarded by local authorities when calculating someone’s assets for charging purposes.
Regulation 2 inserts a new paragraph 42 into Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations. Paragraph 42 provides that payments made to an adult under the Energy Bills Support Scheme (“the Scheme”) are to be disregarded in the calculation of the adult’s capital for the purpose of an assessment of that adult’s financial resources. Under the Scheme financial support is provided to eligible customers in respect of energy bills over winter 2022 to 2023. The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy has published guidance in relation to the Scheme, which can be found at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/getting-the-energy-bills-support-scheme-discount. Hard copies can be obtained from the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, 1 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0ET.

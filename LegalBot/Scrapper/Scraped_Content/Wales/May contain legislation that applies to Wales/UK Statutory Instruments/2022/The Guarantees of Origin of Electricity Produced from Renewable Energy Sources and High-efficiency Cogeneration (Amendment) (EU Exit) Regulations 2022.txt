(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address deficiencies in retained EU law (in particular under section 8(2)(c)).
Part 2 amends the Electricity (Guarantees of Origin of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/2562) (the “2003 Regulations”). The 2003 Regulations provide for the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority to issue guarantees of origin (“GOOs”) in respect of electricity generated from renewable energy sources.
Part 3 amends the Guarantees of Origin of Electricity Produced from High-efficiency Cogeneration Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/292) (the “2007 Regulations”). The 2007 Regulations provide for the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy to issue GOOs in respect of electricity produced from high efficiency cogeneration (known in the UK as Combined Heat and Power).
As of 1st January 2021 and as a result of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, GOOs issued in the UK are no longer recognised by EU member States. However, the UK continued to recognise GOOs issued in EU member States. These Regulations remedy this deficiency by removing the obligations to recognise GOOs issued in an EU member State and by removing references to such GOOs being recognised.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no significant impact on business or the public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

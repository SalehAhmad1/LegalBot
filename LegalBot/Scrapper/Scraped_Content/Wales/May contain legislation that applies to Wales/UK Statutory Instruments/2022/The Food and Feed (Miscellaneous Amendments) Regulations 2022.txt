Upper-bound concentrations; upper-bound concentrations are calculated on the assumption that all values of the different congeners below the limit of quantification are equal to the limit of quantification.
(3)
Identification of source of contamination. Once source is identified, take appropriate measures, where possible, to reduce or eliminate source of contamination.
(4)
In many cases it might not be necessary to perform an investigation into the source of contamination as the background level in some areas is close to or above the action level. However, in cases where the action level is exceeded, all information, such as sampling period, geographical origin, fish species etc., shall be recorded with a view to future measures to manage the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in these materials for animal nutrition.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (in particular under section 8(1) and (2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (f) and (g)) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Part 2 contains amendments to various statutory instruments relating to food and feed that apply in England only. In particular, the amendments remove cross-references to various EU Directives and insert various tables from the Annexes to those Directives, as they had effect immediately before IP completion day, as new Schedules to the instruments concerned, as follows—
(a)
Annexes 1 and 2 from Commission Directive 2007/42/EC relating to materials and articles made of regenerated cellulose film intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (OJ L 172, 30.6.2007, p. 71–82) are inserted as Schedule 5 to the Materials and Articles in Contact with Food (England) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/2619);
(b)
Annex 1 from Directive 2009/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on extraction solvents used in the production of foodstuffs and food ingredients (OJ L 141, 6.6.2009, p. 3–11) is inserted as Schedule 6 to the Food Additives, Flavourings, Enzymes and Extraction Solvents (England) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/2210); and
(c)
the Annex to Commission Directive 82/475/EEC laying down the categories of feed materials which may be used for the purposes of labelling compound feedingstuffs for pet animals (OJ L 213, 21.7.1982, p. 27–28) is inserted as Schedule 3 to the Animal Feed (Composition, Marketing and Use) (England) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/255) and Annexes 1 and 2 from Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on undesirable substances in animal feed (OJ L 140, 30.5.2002, p. 10–22) are inserted as Schedules 4 and 5 to those Regulations.
Part 3 contains amendments to retained direct EU legislation relating to food and feed.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

13 July 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations add corporate joint committees established by regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 to the definition of “relevant authority” in the Local Government Investigations (Functions of Monitoring Officers and Standards Committees) (Wales) Regulations 2001 (“the 2001 Regulations”).
These Regulations also amend the 2001 Regulations to provide that where a corporate joint committee member (or co-opted member) is under investigation, and they are also a member (or co-opted member) of a constituent council or National Park authority, specified information, reports and recommendations must also be sent to that council or authority.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish corporate joint committees, and connected regulations and orders. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment was prepared at the time of making those establishment regulations and is relied on for the purpose of these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

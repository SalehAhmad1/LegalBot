The Environment Agency (Upper Black Moss and Lower Black Moss Reservoirs) Drought Order 2022
Made
17th October 2022
Coming into force
18th October 2022
The Environment Agency has made an application for an ordinary drought order under section 73(3)(a) of the Water Resources Act 1991 (“the Act”)(1).
The Secretary of State is satisfied that proper notices of the application have been published and served by the Environment Agency in accordance with paragraph 1 of Schedule 8 to the Act(2) and no objections to the application have been made.
The Secretary of State is satisfied that, by reason of an exceptional shortage of rain, there exists such a deficiency in the level of water in the Upper Black Moss and Lower Black Moss reservoirs as to pose a serious threat to flora and fauna which are dependent on those waters, including flora and fauna in Black Moss Water, into which the reservoirs flow.
It appears to the Secretary of State expedient to make the provisions in this Order with a view to meeting this deficiency.
The Secretary of State makes this Order in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 73(1) and 74(1)(d) and (5) of, and paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 8 to, the Act(3).

17th October 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, made on the application of the Agency, makes provision to meet a deficiency in the level of water in the Black Moss Reservoir, which arises from an exceptional shortage of rain and poses a serious threat to the flora and fauna which are dependent on those waters, including flora and fauna in Black Moss Water, a river into which these reservoirs flow. In accordance with section 74(3) of the Water Resources Act 1991 (c. 57), this Order will cease to have effect on 17th April 2023 (within six months of the day on which the Order comes into force).
The abstraction licence numbered 2671322033 currently requires United Utilities Water Limited (“the Company”) to make a continuous release of compensation flow from Black Moss Reservoir to Black Moss Water of not less than 2,682 cubic metres per day.
The effect of this Order is to modify the conditions in the abstraction licence so that the volume of compensation water that the Company is required to release is reduced to not less than 1,341 cubic metres per day.
Article 4 imposes conditions on the Company in respect of environmental monitoring and remediation which expire when the Order ceases to have effect.
Article 5 provides that the modifications made by this Order are not to be taken as authorising any environmental damage for the purposes of the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (England) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/810) (and accordingly, the Company may not rely on this Order to support grounds for an appeal against a notice relating to remediation of environmental damage).
The abstraction licence is available for public inspection at the Environment Agency, Lutra House, Dodd Way, Off Seedlee Road, Walton Summit, Bamber Bridge, Preston, PR5 8BX.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

3rd March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends, with effect from 1st April 2023, section 66 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”), which defines domestic property for the purposes of non-domestic rating under Part 3 of the 1988 Act.
Section 66(2B) provides that a property is not domestic property if the owner intends to let it commercially as self-catering accommodation for short periods totalling 140 days or more. Article 2 of this Order amends subsection (2B) to include two additional conditions. These are that the property must have been available to let in the same way for 140 days or more in the previous year and that it must have been in fact let in that way for at least 70 days during that year.
A regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument amends an existing local tax regime.

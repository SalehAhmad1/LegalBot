(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are the second commencement regulations made under the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (“the 2022 Act”). They bring into force section 201(2) of the 2022 Act, which repeals section 55 of and Schedule 25 to the Coronavirus Act 2020(1). Section 55 of and Schedule 25 to the Coronavirus Act 2020 make provision for specified courts and tribunals to be able to transmit proceedings which are held entirely remotely to observers, to maintain open justice in such cases; and they are replaced by a more comprehensive scheme for transmission of proceedings for which sections 198 and 199 of the 2022 Act make provision. Section 201(2) of the 2022 Act is commenced for all purposes except those of certain provisions in Tribunal Procedure Rules and Employment Appeal Tribunal Rules which provide for certain rules to cease to have effect when section 55(b) of the Coronavirus Act 2020 expires for all purposes – which in the absence of repeal is at the end of the period of six months beginning with 25th March 2022, by virtue of the Coronavirus Act 2020 (Delay in Expiry: Inquests, Courts and Tribunals, and Statutory Sick Pay) (England and Wales and Northern Ireland) Regulations 2022(2). The effect of section 201(2) of the 2022 Act not being commenced for the purposes of the specified provisions of rules is that those provisions will continue in force until the end of the period of six months beginning with 25th March 2022, which will allow time for a more permanent amendment of the rules in question.
An impact assessment has not been published for these Regulations as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision concerning the operation of the Architects Registration Board (“the ARB”) and the implementation, with respect to architects, of the agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Swiss Confederation on citizens’ rights following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the Free Movement of Persons Agreement (the “Swiss Citizens Rights Agreement”).
Regulation 2 gives the ARB the ability to charge fees for certain services. The fees charged must not exceed the reasonable costs of providing the service, to be calculated taking one year with another so that if costs vary from year to year the fees need not.
Regulation 3 makes amendments to the Architects Act 1997 to facilitate the use of electronic communication by the ARB and changes the rules around membership of committees it establishes.
Regulation 4 amends the Architects Act 1997 (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 to implement fully the professional qualifications provisions of the Swiss Citizens Rights Agreement in respect of architects.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

At 10.15 a.m. on 10th February 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) to amend the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the 2019 Regulations”). These Regulations amend the designation criteria in regulation 6 of the 2019 Regulations to specify additional activities for which a person may be designated.
Under the amended criteria, an “involved person” now includes a person who is or has been involved in “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”. Paragraph (4) of regulation 6 defines that term. Paragraph (7) contains relevant definitions of terms used in the amended provision.
An Impact Assessment has not been produced for these Regulations, as any impact will result primarily from any future increase in the number of sanctions designations. An Impact Assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and can be found at:https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653271/Sanctions_and_Anti-Money_Laundering_Bill_Impact_Assessment_18102017.pdf.

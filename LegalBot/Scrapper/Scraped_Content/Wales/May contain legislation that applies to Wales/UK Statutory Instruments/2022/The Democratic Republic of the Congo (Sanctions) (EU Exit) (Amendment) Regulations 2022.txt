28th November 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
The Regulations make amendments to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/433) (“the Democratic Republic of the Congo Regulations”) which were made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act.
The Regulations amend the Democratic Republic of the Congo Regulations to insert into regulation 4(4) a reference to paragraph 3 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2641 (2022), adopted on 30 June 2022 (“Resolution 2641”). That paragraph decides that the financial and travel sanctions in paragraphs 9 and 11 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1807 (2008), adopted on 31 March 2008 (“Resolution 1807”), shall also apply to individuals and entities designated by the relevant UN Sanctions Committee for involvement in the production, manufacture or use in the Democratic Republic of the Congo of improvised explosive devices, or in the commission, planning, ordering, aiding, abetting or otherwise assistance of attacks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with improvised explosive devices. The amendments made by these Regulations enable implementation of the UK’s UN obligations in respect of financial sanctions. They also amend the designation criteria in regulation 6(2) to allow the Secretary of State to designate persons by name under that same criterion. Further, the Regulations remove reference to UN resolutions which have been superseded.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

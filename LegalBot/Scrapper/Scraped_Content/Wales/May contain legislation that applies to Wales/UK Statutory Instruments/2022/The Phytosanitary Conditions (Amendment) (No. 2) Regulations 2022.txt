(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 (the “Phytosanitary Conditions Regulation”) establishing uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and the Council as regards protective measure against pests of plants (EUR 2016/2031).
Regulation 2 amends the special requirements applicable under the Phytosanitary Conditions Regulation to prevent the introduction of the plant pest Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis & Schiffermüller) in Great Britain on the introduction of the following plants which are hosts of this pest: Cedrus Trew and Pinus L, originating from any third country. Specifically, it removes the special requirement that previously applied to plants for planting (other than seeds) for those plants to be accompanied by an official statement that they have been produced in nurseries which have been found free from Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis & Schiffermüller) on the basis of official inspections and surveys carried out at appropriate times, and alters the remaining special requirements in respect of Cedrus Trew and Pinus L so that they apply to all plants (other than seeds) originating from any third country, irrespective of whether they are plants for planting.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private of voluntary sector is foreseen.

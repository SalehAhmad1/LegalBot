This instrument amends the Non-Domestic Rating (Transitional Protection Payments) Regulations 2013 (“the TPP Regulations”) and the Non-Domestic Rating (Rates Retention) Regulations 2013 (“the Rates Retention Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the TPP Regulations. These amendments change the deadline for end-of-year calculations for the transitional protection payment regime to 30 November in relation to the relevant year beginning in 2021 and to 30 September thereafter.
Regulation 3 amends the Rates Retention Regulations. These amendments change the deadline for end-of-year calculations for the business rates retention scheme to 30 November in relation to the relevant year beginning in 2021 and to 30 September thereafter.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument because it amends an existing local tax regime. Publication of a full impact assessment is not necessary for such legislation.

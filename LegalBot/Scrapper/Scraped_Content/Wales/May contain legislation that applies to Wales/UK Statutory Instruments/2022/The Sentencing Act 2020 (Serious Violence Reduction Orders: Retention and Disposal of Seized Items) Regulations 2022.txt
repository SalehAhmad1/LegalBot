(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 342E of the Sentencing Act 2020 (c. 17) (“the Sentencing Code”) provides constables with a power to search a person subject to a Serious Violence Reduction Order to ascertain if they have a bladed article or offensive weapon with them. Section 342E(4) enables a constable to seize anything found in the course of the search which the constable reasonably suspects to be a bladed article or an offensive weapon.
These Regulations make provision for the retention, safe-keeping, disposal and destruction of items seized under section 342E(4) of the Sentencing Code. They do not apply to items to which the Police (Property) Regulations 1997 (S.I. 1997/1908) (“the 1997 Regulations”) apply. The 1997 Regulations apply to property that is in the possession of the police in connection with their investigation of a suspected offence and in respect of which the owner has not been ascertained and no court order has been made. The 1997 Regulations also apply to items in the possession of the police by virtue of a deprivation order made under section 153 of the Sentencing Code and in respect of which no application by a claimant has been made within six months of the making of the order or no such application has succeeded.
Regulation 3 specifies the period for which items must be retained by the relevant officer.
Regulation 4 makes provision to enable the owner of an item to make an application to the relevant police officer to have that item released to him.
Regulation 5 makes provision for the retention and disposal of items after the expiration of the period specified in regulation 3, or following an unsuccessful application made under regulation 4.
An impact assessment has been prepared in relation to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (c. 32) which inserted sections 342A to 342L, providing for Serious Violence Reduction Orders, into the Sentencing Code. A copy of the impact assessment is available on legislation.gov.uk. A hard copy can be obtained by writing to the Home Office at 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make adjustments to the level of European seabass that may be caught as a by-catch within British fishery limits.
Regulation 2 amends Council Regulation (EU) 2020/123 to update the provisions which regulate sea bass fishing. The amendments increase the time period for which weight limits for unavoidable by-catches for vessels using trawls and seines are to be assessed from one month to two consecutive months. They also increase the catch limits for vessels authorised to retain seabass when using hook and line and fixed gillnets.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary, or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in England only, amend The Apprenticeships (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2017. They add to the list of standards within which a person may complete an alternative English apprenticeship by way of a flexi-job apprenticeship. A flexi-job apprenticeship permits a person to complete an alternative English apprenticeship entering into a series of arrangements of at least 3 months duration that total a minimum of 12 months. During this period the person is expected to work and receive training within a specified approved standard, which are listed in regulation 6(8) of The Apprenticeships (Miscellaneous Provision) Regulations 2017, as amended.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

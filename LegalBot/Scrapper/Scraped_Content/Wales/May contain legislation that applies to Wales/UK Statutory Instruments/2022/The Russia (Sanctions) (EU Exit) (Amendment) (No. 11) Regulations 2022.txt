TECHNICAL NOTES FOR 2B991 TO 2B999:
1. Secondary parallel contouring axes, (e.g., the w-axis on horizontal boring mills or a secondary rotary axis the centre line of which is parallel to the primary rotary axis) are not counted in the total number of contouring axes. Rotary axes need not rotate over 360°. A rotary axis can be driven by a linear device (e.g., a screw or a rack-and-pinion).
2. The number of axes which can be coordinated simultaneously for “contouring control” is the number of axes along or around which, during processing of the workpiece, simultaneous and interrelated motions are performed between the workpiece and a tool. This does not include any additional axes along or around which other relative motions within the machine are performed, such as:
2.a. Wheel-dressing systems in grinding machines; Yes
2.b. Parallel rotary axes designed for mounting of separate workpieces;
2.c. Co-linear rotary axes designed for manipulating the same workpiece by holding it in a chuck from different ends.

4. A “tilting spindle” is counted as a rotary axis. Yes
5. ‘Stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability”’ may be used for each specific machine model as an alternative to individual machine tests, and is determined as follows: Yes
5.a. Select five machines of a model to be evaluated; Yes
5.b. Measure the linear axis repeatability (R↑,R↓) according to ISO 230-2:2014 and evaluate “unidirectional positioning repeatability” for each axis of each of the five machines; Yes
5.c. Determine the arithmetic mean value of the “unidirectional positioning repeatability”-values for each axis of all five machines together. These arithmetic mean values “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ( ) become the stated value of each axis for the model...)( x, y, …); Yes
5.d. Since the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many ‘stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability”’ values as there are linear axes; Yes
5.e. If any axis of a machine model not controlled by 2B001.a. to 2B001.c. has a ‘stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability”’ equal to or less than the specified “unidirectional positioning repeatability” of each machine tool model plus 0.7 µm, the builder should be required to reaffirm the accuracy level once every eighteen months. Yes
6. For the purpose of 2B, measurement uncertainty for the “unidirectional positioning repeatability” of machine tools, as defined in the International Standard ISO 230-2:2014, shall not be considered. Yes
7. For the purpose of 2B, the measurement of axes shall be made according to test procedures in 5.3.2. of ISO 230-2:2014. Tests for axes longer than 2 meters shall be made over 2 m segments. Axes longer than 4 m require multiple tests (e.g., two tests for axes longer than 4 m and up to 8 m, three tests for axes longer than 8 m and up to 12 m), each over 2 m segments and distributed in equal intervals over the axis length. Test segments are equally spaced along the full axis length, with any excess length equally divided at the beginning, in between, and at the end of the test segments.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) to amend the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
Regulations 3 to 8 and 12(2) to (5) and (8) amend Part 5 of the 2019 Regulations relating to trade, and both amend existing Schedules and insert new ones. New restrictions are imposed in relation to trade in—
maritime goods and maritime technology in certain circumstances (regulation 5);
military goods and technology with non-government controlled Ukrainian territory (as specified in new Chapter 2A of Part 5);
defence and security goods and technology (as specified in Parts 2 to 4 of new Schedule 3C);
interception and monitoring services;
banknotes;
jet fuel and fuel additives (as specified in an addition to Part 8 of Schedule 2A); and
goods which generate significant revenues for Russia (as specified in new Schedule 3D).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/2864, “the 1999 Regulations” and make provision for changes to the specification requirements for category A2 motorcycles used for practical driving tests, and the upgrading of entitlements where a second driving test is passed in an automatic transmission vehicle.
Regulation 3 reduces the minimum test vehicle requirement for the engine size of a motorcycle used on the A2 motorcycle test from 395 cubic centimetres to 245 cubic centimetres.
Regulation 4 omits a paragraph in Regulation 45 which is no longer relevant because all references to “(a)” in Table B were removed when Table B was substituted by the Road Traffic Act 1988 and Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3190).
Regulation 5 introduces a new Table B in Schedule 9 to the 1999 Regulations which is to be read with Regulation 45 (upgrading of entitlements by virtue of passing a second test) of those Regulations. Table B indicates that passing a driving test in an automatic transmission vehicle of a category listed in column A will result in the candidate being granted a manual transmission vehicle driving entitlement for that category too, if they have already passed a driving test in a manual transmission vehicle of a category listed in one or more corresponding columns (1) to (10). The new Table re-states the existing Table but adds some new entries to provide for such manual driving entitlement to be granted in respect of vehicle categories B+E (car and trailer), C1 (medium-sized lorries), D1 (mini buses), C1+E (medium sized lorry + trailer), and D1+E (mini bus + trailer).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

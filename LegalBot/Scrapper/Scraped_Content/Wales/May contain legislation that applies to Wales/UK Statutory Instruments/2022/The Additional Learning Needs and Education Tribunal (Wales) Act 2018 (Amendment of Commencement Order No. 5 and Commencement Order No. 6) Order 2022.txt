At 4.31 p.m. on 10 June 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 (Commencement No. 5 and Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2021 and the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 (Commencement No. 6 and Transitional and Saving Provisions) Order 2021.
These two commencement orders require maintained schools (Commencement Order No. 5) and local authorities (Commencement Order No. 6) to give certain children an IDP notice or a No IDP notice. This Order amends the requirement in relation to the 2021-2022 school year, so that the IDP notice or the No IDP notice can be given during the 2021-2022 school year or the 2022-2023 school year (articles 2(2) and 3(2)). It also makes an amendment which is consequential on that change (articles 2(4) and 3(4)).
This Order also amends the year groups to which an IDP notice or a No IDP notice must be given during the 2022-2023 school year (articles 2(3) and (5) and articles 3(3) and (5)).

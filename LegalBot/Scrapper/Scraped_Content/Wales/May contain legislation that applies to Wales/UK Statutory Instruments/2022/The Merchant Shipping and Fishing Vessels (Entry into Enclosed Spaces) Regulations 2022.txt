(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Merchant Shipping (Entry into Dangerous Spaces) Regulations 1988 (S.I. 1988/1638); re-enact certain provisions of those Regulations; give effect to the new regulation 7 of Chapter XI-1 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974 (“SOLAS”); and extend the requirements of that regulation and regulation 19 of Chapter III of SOLAS to ships other than SOLAS ships.
The Regulations require shipowners, masters, employers of seafarers and other persons to comply with obligations designed to avoid deaths or injuries in enclosed spaces.
The Regulations provide for the granting of exemptions (regulation 10).
The Regulations also provide for contravention of the various requirements to be offences and subject to criminal penalties (regulation 11). In cases of non-compliance a ship may be detained (regulation 12).
The Merchant Shipping (Fees) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1104) are amended to substitute a reference to these Regulations for the existing reference to the Merchant Shipping (Entry into Dangerous Spaces) Regulations 1988 (regulation 13).

14th October 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Schedule to the Public Interest Disclosure (Prescribed Persons) Order 2014.
The Employment Rights Act 1996 (“1996 Act”) provides protection for workers who suffer a detriment or are dismissed as a result of blowing the whistle by making a qualifying disclosure within the meaning of section 43B of the 1996 Act in accordance with any of sections 43C to 43H of that Act. Section 43F of the 1996 Act provides that a qualifying disclosure will be protected if it is made to a prescribed person and relates to matters in respect of which that person is prescribed. Schedule 1 to the 2014 Order lists the prescribed persons and the matters in respect of which they are prescribed for the purposes of section 43F.
This Order amends the Schedule to the 2014 Order to include some persons not previously included, delete others and to amend the description of matters for which certain persons are prescribed.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

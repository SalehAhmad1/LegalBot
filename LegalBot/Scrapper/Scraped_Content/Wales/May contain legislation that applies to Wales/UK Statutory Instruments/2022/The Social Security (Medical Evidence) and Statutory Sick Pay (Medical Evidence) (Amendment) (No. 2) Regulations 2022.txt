8th June 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1976 (“the 1976 Regulations”) and the Statutory Sick Pay (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1985 (“the 1985 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the 1976 Regulations, and regulation 3 amends the 1985 Regulations, to expand the people who can sign statements (which are known as “fit notes”) to include registered nurses, occupational therapists, pharmacists and physiotherapists. Fit notes are the prescribed form of evidence for social security and statutory sick pay purposes. Regulations 2 and 3 replace references to “doctor” with references to “healthcare professional”. They also insert a definition of “healthcare professional” which includes doctors and the four new professions.
Regulation 4 makes consequential amendments to other sets of Regulations which refer to medical evidence under the 1976 Regulations as having been signed by doctors or registered medical practitioners.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

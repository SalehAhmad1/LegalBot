The Curriculum and Assessment (Wales) Act 2021 (“the 2021 Act”) establishes a new legal framework for a curriculum and makes provision about assessment for children and pupils in Wales (“the new CfW”). Section 74(1) of the 2021 Act provides that the Welsh Ministers may make consequential amendments in relation to that Act in order to give it its effect. Section 75(1)(b) of the 2021 Act further provides that the Welsh Ministers may make different provision for different purposes.
The new CfW will be rolled out for children and pupils in a phased manner. The new CfW will become mandatory for the year groups in schools and other settings as follows—
(a)
from 1 September 2022 for—
(i)
children for whom funded non-maintained nursery education is provided,
(ii)
pupils receiving nursery education at maintained schools and maintained nursery schools,
(iii)
pupils in their reception year, and
(iv)
pupils in years 1 to 6,
(b)
from 1 September 2022 for children and pupils in year 7 in those schools and other settings where there is a curriculum provided in accordance with the 2021 Act,
(c)
from 1 September 2023 for children and pupils—
(i)
in year 7, and
(ii)
in year 8,
(d)
from 1 September 2024 for children and pupils in year 9,
(e)
from 1 September 2025 for children and pupils in year 10, and
(f)
from 1 September 2026 for children and pupils in years 11 to 13.
These Regulations apply in relation to children and pupils to whom education is provided—
(a)
in maintained schools,
(b)
in maintained nursery schools,
(c)
by funded non-maintained nursery education providers,
(d)
in pupil referral units, and
(e)
by persons who provide teaching and learning for a child otherwise than at a maintained school, maintained nursery school or pupil referral unit by virtue of arrangements made under section 19A of the Education Act 1996.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

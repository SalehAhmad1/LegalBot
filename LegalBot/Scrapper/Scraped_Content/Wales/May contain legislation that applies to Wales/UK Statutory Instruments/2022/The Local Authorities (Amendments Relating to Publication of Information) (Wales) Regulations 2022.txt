30 March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in relation to Wales, amend the Local Government Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”) and the Local Authorities (Executive Arrangements) (Decisions, Documents and Meetings) (Wales) Regulations 2001 (“the 2001 Regulations”).
Section 100G(1) of the 1972 Act requires a principal council (in Wales, these include county and county borough councils, fire and rescue authorities, National Park authorities and joint boards or joint committees which fall within section 100J(2) of the 1972 Act and which discharge functions of two or more principal councils in Wales) to maintain a register stating, amongst other things, the name and address of every member of the council, including members of committees and sub-committees. Section 100G(4) of the 1972 Act requires that register to be open to inspection by the public at the offices of the council.
Regulation 12(1) of the 2001 Regulations also requires a Welsh local authority (county and county borough councils operating executive arrangements) to maintain a register stating, amongst other things, the name and address of every member of the executive, and every member of each committee of the executive of that authority. Regulation 12(3) requires that register to be open to inspection by the public at the principal office of the authority.
These Regulations amend the 1972 Act and the 2001 Regulations to provide that the addresses of members included in the registers must not be open to inspection by the public at the offices of principal councils or the principal offices of local authorities.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of regulatory impact assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

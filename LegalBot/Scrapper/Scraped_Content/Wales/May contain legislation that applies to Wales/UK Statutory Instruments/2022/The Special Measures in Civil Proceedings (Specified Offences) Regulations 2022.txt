(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 64 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17) requires rules of court to make provision enabling the court to make a special measures direction in civil proceedings in relation to victims and alleged victims of specified offences. These Regulations set out the list of offences that are ‘specified offences’ for this purpose. Special measures are certain steps or provisions that may assist a person, including those who are vulnerable, to give evidence or participate in proceedings.
Regulation 2 introduces the Schedule to the Regulations which contains a list of the specified offences under the law of England and Wales (table 1), Scotland (table 2) and Northern Ireland (table 3).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides for the establishment, on 1st April 2023, of a single tier of local government in the county of Somerset. Somerset county will be administered by a county council, referred to in this Order as “the Somerset Council”.
The area of Somerset county remains unchanged. A new district is created, with the same area as the county. The existing local government districts are abolished and the district councils wound up.
There are two transitional periods leading up to 1st April 2023 enabling the existing councils to prepare for the transition to a single tier of local government.
The first transitional period begins when this Order comes into force and ends shortly after the Somerset Council election day in 2022.
During this first transitional period the Somerset Council will discharge the main transitional functions via a committee called “the Implementation Executive”. Part 3 of the Order sets out the membership, functions and arrangements relating to the Implementation Executive.
During the second transitional period (from the end of the first transitional period until 1st April 2023) the Somerset Council’s executive will be responsible for the main transitional functions.
Part 4 of the Order deals with further transitional duties including duties on the Somerset council and existing district councils to cooperate with each other.
Article 5 provides that the term of office of all district councillors expires on 1st April 2023.
Article 13 requires the holding of a whole council election to the Somerset Council in 2022, 2027 and every four years thereafter.
Article 14 makes provision in relation to district council by-elections.
Article 15 makes provision in relation to parish council elections.
The schedule sets out the new electoral divisions of the Somerset Council.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument will have no impact on the costs of business and the voluntary sector. The impact of the public sector is a simplification to the system of local government in Somerset.

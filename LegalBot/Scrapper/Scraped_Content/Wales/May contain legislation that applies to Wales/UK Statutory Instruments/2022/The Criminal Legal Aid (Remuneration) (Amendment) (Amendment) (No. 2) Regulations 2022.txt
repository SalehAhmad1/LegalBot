(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Criminal Legal Aid (Remuneration) (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/848) (“the 2022 Regulations”). The 2022 Regulations amended the Criminal Legal Aid (Remuneration) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/435) (“the Remuneration Regulations”) which make provision for the remuneration of advice, assistance and representation made available under sections 13, 15 and 16 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (c. 10).
The 2022 Regulations amended Schedules 1 to 6 to the Remuneration Regulations to provide an increase to various fees within the Remuneration Regulations.
These Regulations amend the 2022 Regulations so that the increases to certain fees within the Advocates’ Graduated Fee Scheme and the Litigators’ Graduated Fee Scheme made by the 2022 Regulations will apply to a wider range of cases. The increase will now apply not only to cases where a relevant determination was made on or after 30th September 2022, but also to any case where a relevant determination was made on or after 17th September 2020 but before 30th September 2022 and a main hearing takes place on or after 31st October 2022.

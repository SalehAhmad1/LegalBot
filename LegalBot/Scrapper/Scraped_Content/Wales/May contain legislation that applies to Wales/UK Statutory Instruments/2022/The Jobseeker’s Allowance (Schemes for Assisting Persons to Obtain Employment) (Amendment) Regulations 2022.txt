17th February 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Jobseeker’s Allowance (Schemes for Assisting Persons to Obtain Employment) Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”). Regulation 2(2)(a) removes the Work Programme from Regulation 3 of the 2013 Regulations as this scheme no longer operates.
Regulation 2(2)(b) prescribes the Restart Scheme for the purposes of Section 17A of the Jobseekers Act 1995 which grants the power to impose on claimants in certain circumstances a requirement to participate in schemes that are designed to assist them to obtain employment. The Restart Scheme is for claimants who reside in England and Wales.
This means that persons claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) who are selected under regulation 4 of the 2013 Regulations, which enables the selection of claimants for participation in a scheme, are required to participate in the Restart Scheme. By virtue of section 19A Jobseekers Act 1995 if a claimant fails without good reason to comply with such a requirement is liable to a benefit sanction i.e. the reduction or loss of JSA for a period of several weeks.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

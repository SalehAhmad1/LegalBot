(a)
first have regards to paragraphs (2) to (6) below; and
(b)
then have regard to rule 93(1);
and if the judge advocate is required by paragraphs (2) to (6) to give such a direction, any special measure which must be provided for in the direction under paragraph (2) or (4) is to be treated for the purposes of rule 93(1)(b), as it then applies to the witness, as one which is likely to improve the quality of evidence given by the witness (whether on its own or in combination with any other special measure).
(2) The primary rule in the case of a child witness is that the judge advocate must give a special measures direction in relation to the witness which provides for any relevant recording to be admitted under section 27 of the 1999 Act (video recorded evidence in chief).
(3) The primary rule is subject to the following limitations—
(a)
the requirement contained in paragraph (2) has effect subject to rule 95(1);
(b)
if the witness informs the judge advocate of the witness’s wish that the primary rule should not apply or should apply only in part, the rule does not apply to the extent that the judge advocate is satisfied that not complying with the rule would not diminish the quality of the witness’s evidence; and
(c)
the rule does not apply to the extent that the judge advocate is satisfied that compliance with it would not be likely to improve the quality of the witness’s evidence (whether because the application to that evidence of one or more other special measures available in relation to the witness would have that result or for any other reason).
(4) Where as a consequence of all or part of the primary rule being disapplied under paragraph (3)(b) a witness’s evidence or any part of it would fall to be given as testimony in court, the judge advocate must give a special measures direction making such provision as is described in section 23 of the 1999 Act (screening witness from the accused) for the evidence or that part of it.
(5) The requirement in paragraph (4) is subject to the following limitations—
(a)
if the witness informs the judge advocate of the witness’s wish that the requirement in paragraph (4) should not apply, the requirement does not apply to the extent that the judge advocate is satisfied that not complying with it would not diminish the quality of the witness’s evidence; and
(b)
the requirement does not apply to the extent that the judge advocate is satisfied that making such a provision would not be likely to improve the quality of the witness’s evidence (whether because the application to that evidence of one or more other special measures available in relation to the witness would have that result or for any other reason).
(6) In making a decision under paragraph (3)(b) or (5)(a), the judge advocate must take into account the following factors (and any others it considers relevant)—
(a)
the age and maturity of the witness;
(b)
the ability of the witness to understand the consequences of giving evidence otherwise than in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (2) or (as the case may be) in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (4);
(c)
the relationship (if any) between the witness and the defendant;
(d)
the witness’s social and cultural background and ethnic origins;
(e)
the nature of the alleged circumstances of the offence to which the proceedings relate.
(7) Where a special measures direction is given in relation to a child witness who is not also an eligible witness in accordance with rule 90(2), then—
(a)
subject to paragraph (8) below; and
(b)
except where the witness has already begun to give evidence in the proceedings;
the direction shall cease to have effect at the time when the witness attains the age of 18.
(8) Where a special measures direction is given in relation to a child witness who is not also an eligible witness in accordance with rule 90(2) and—
(a)
the direction provides—
(i)
for any relevant recording to be admitted under section 27 of the 1999 Act as evidence in chief of the witness; or
(ii)
for the special measure available under section 28 of the 1999 Act (video recorded cross-examination or re-examination) to apply in relation to the witness; and
(b)
if it provides for that special measure to so apply, the witness is still under the age of 18 when the video recording is made for the purposes of section 28;
then, so far as it provides as mentioned in sub-paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above, the direction shall continue to have effect even though the witness subsequently attains that age.
(9) In this rule—
(a)
a witness is a “child witness” if the witness is an eligible witness by reason of rule 90(1) (whether or not the witness is an eligible witness by reason of any other provision of rule 90 or 91); and
(b)
a relevant recording, in relation to a child witness, is a video recording of an interview of the witness made with a view to its admission as evidence in chief of the witness.

(2) In this rule—
(a)
a witness (other than the defendant) is a “qualifying witness” if the witness—
(i)
is not an eligible witness, but
(ii)
was under the age of 18 when the relevant recording was made in relation to the witness; and

(10) In this rule—
(a)
an “offence of human trafficking for sexual exploitation” is an offence under section 42 (criminal conduct) as respects which the corresponding offence under the law of England and Wales is—

These Rules make amendments to the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (Application to Service Courts) Order 2009 (S.I. 1999/2083) (“the 1999 Order”), the Armed Forces (Court Martial) Rules 2009 (S.I. 2009/2041) (“the Court Martial rules”) and the Armed Forces (Service Civilian Court) Rules 2009 (S.I. 2009/1209) (“the Service Civilian Court rules”). These amendments relate to the provision of special measures for vulnerable and intimidated witnesses in proceedings in the service courts.
The amendments made by these Rules to the 1999 Order are to Articles 3 and 4 of that Order, which applies provisions of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (c. 23) (“the 1999 Act”) on the use of special measures in civilian criminal proceedings to the service courts, allowing these special measures to be used in proceedings in the service courts. The amendments firstly apply section 22A of the 1999 Act to proceedings in the Court Martial Appeal Court, which provides rules on the use of video recorded evidence in chief in proceedings relating to sexual offences. The amendments also apply section 28 of the 1999 Act to proceedings in the Court Martial Appeal Court and section 28(1) to proceedings in the Court Martial and Service Civilian Court, allowing the use of video recorded cross-examination or re-examination as a special measure in these courts.
The amendments made by these Rules to the Court Martial rules and Service Civilian Court rules firstly insert new rules 93A to 93B in the Court Martial rules and 78A to 78B in the Service Civilian Court rules, which are based on section 21, 22 of the 1999 Act on the use of video recorded evidence in chief for child witnesses. A new rule 93C is inserted in the Court Martial rules, which is based on section 22A of the 1999 Act on the use of video recorded evidence in chief in proceedings for sexual offences. The amendments also insert a new rule 95 in the Court Martial rules and 80A in the Service Civilian Court rules, which are based on section 28(2) to (7) of the 1999 Act, to supplement section 28(1) of that Act, which will apply in the Court Martial and Service Civilian Court under the amendment made by these Rules to the 1999 Order.
Finally, these Rules make amendments relating to eligibility for special measures of witnesses in proceedings for offences relating to domestic abuse and allowing for such witnesses to give evidence in private to mirror changes made to equivalent provisions in the 1999 Act by section 62 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17).

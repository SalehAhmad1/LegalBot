These Rules make provision related to the requirement for voters to present photographic identification when voting at polling stations. The rules amend the rules governing the election of principal area councillors and parish councillors in England, and the election of the Mayor of London and members of the London Assembly, making equivalent amendments to those made by Schedule 1 to the Elections Act 2022 (c. 37) to the UK parliamentary elections rules in Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2).
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business and the voluntary sector and community bodies is available from the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities at 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF and published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

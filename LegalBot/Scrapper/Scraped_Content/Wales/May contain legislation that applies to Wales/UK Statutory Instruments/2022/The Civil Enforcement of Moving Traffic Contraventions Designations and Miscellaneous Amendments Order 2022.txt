20th June 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order designates part of the following local authority areas as moving traffic contravention civil enforcement areas for the purposes of Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004: Oxfordshire County Council, Bath and North East Somerset Council, Buckinghamshire Council, Derby City Council, Hampshire County Council, Reading Borough Council, Surrey County Council, Kent County Council, Norfolk County Council, Durham County Council and Bedford Borough Council. This Order also designates the whole of the Borough of Luton as a civil enforcement area for moving traffic contraventions for the purposes of Part 6 of the Traffic Management Act 2004. Each of the areas designated is the same as, or falls within, the area already designated by the local authority for the enforcement of parking contraventions.
The practical effect of the Order is to enable the local authorities mentioned in the preceding paragraph to enforce moving traffic contraventions within all or part of their areas (as applicable) through a civil law regime.
The Order also amends the Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions Designation Order 2021 (“the 2021 Order”), the Civil Enforcement of Road Traffic Contraventions (Approved Devices, Charging Guidelines and General Provisions) (England) Regulations 2022 (“the 2022 Regulations”), and the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles Regulations 1986 (“the 1986 Regulations”).
The Order amends paragraphs 2(5)(b) and 2(5)(c) in Schedule 1 to the 2021 Order to correct typographical errors in the names of the roads which are excluded from the civil enforcement area in the area of Oxfordshire County Council for parking contraventions.
The Order amends regulation 14 of the 2022 Regulations to change the requirements regarding the minimum period which must elapse before an immobilisation device can be fixed to a vehicle following certain parking contraventions. Following the amendment, this period will be 15 minutes in all circumstances. In consequence of this change, regulation 35 of the 2022 Regulations is no longer required and has therefore been revoked. The other amendments to the 2022 Regulations made by the Order consist of minor corrections.
The Order amends regulation 5C of the 1986 Regulations to change the requirements regarding the minimum period which must elapse before a vehicle can be removed following certain parking contraventions. Following the amendment, this period will be 15 minutes in all circumstances.
A full Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary, or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared for this Order and is available alongside this Order on the UK Legislation website www.legislation.gov.uk.

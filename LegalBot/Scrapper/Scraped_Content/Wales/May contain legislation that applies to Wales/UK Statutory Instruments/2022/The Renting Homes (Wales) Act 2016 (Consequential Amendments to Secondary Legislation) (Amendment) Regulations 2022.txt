(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 1) (“the 2016 Act”) provides for most tenancies and licences of dwellings occupied by individuals as homes in Wales to be occupation contracts. The 2016 Act also makes provision as to the terms of occupation contracts.
The Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (Consequential Amendments to Secondary Legislation) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/907 (W. 198)) (“the 2022 Regulations”) make consequential amendments to secondary legislation to reflect the new provisions in the 2016 Act. These Regulations correct minor technical and typographical errors in the 2022 Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this instrument.

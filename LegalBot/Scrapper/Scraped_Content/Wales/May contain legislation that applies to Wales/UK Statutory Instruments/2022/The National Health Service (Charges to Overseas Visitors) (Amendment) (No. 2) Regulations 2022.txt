(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/238, “the 2015 Regulations”) which provide for the making and recovery of charges for relevant services provided under the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41) to overseas visitors, that is persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.
Regulation 2 amends the 2015 Regulations to provide exemptions from charging in relation to overseas visitors who are lawfully present in the United Kingdom but are ordinarily resident in Ukraine, as well as exemptions for their family members, authorised companions (the definition for which is amended by regulation 2(2) to include persons accompanying overseas visitors from Ukraine who are receiving a course of treatment) and authorised children. The exemptions from charging do not apply to chargeable assisted conception services.
Regulation 2 also provides that charges incurred since 24th February 2022 until the coming into force of these Regulations in respect of such overseas visitors should: if not yet made, not be made; or, if made, should not be recovered; or, if paid, should be repaid.
Regulation 3 provides for the Secretary of State to carry out a review before 17th September 2022.

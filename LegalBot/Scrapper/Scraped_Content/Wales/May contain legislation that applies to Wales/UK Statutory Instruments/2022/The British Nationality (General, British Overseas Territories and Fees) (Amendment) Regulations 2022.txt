30th May 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the British Nationality (General) Regulations 2003, the British Nationality (British Overseas Territories) Regulations 2007 and the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018. The amendments are made in connection with changes made by the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 (“the 2022 Act”) to Parts 1 and 2 of the British Nationality Act 1981 (“the 1981 Act”), which are concerned principally with the acquisition of British citizenship and British overseas territories citizenship.
Regulation 2 amends the British Nationality (General) Regulations 2003. Regulation 2(2)(a) amends paragraph 11B of Schedule 2 to those Regulations to reflect an amendment made to section 4F of the 1981 Act by section 7(3) of the 2022 Act, and to add to the circumstances in which an application for registration as a British citizen under section 4F must contain information showing that the applicant is of good character. Regulation 2(2)(b) and (d) makes provision about the information which must be contained in applications for registration as a British citizen under section 4K or 4L of the 1981 Act or under paragraph 3A of Schedule 2 to that Act. Regulation 2(2)(c) makes an amendment to one of the provisions inserted by regulation 2(2)(b) to take account of the later coming into force of section 3 of the 2022 Act.
Regulation 3 amends the British Nationality (British Overseas Territories) Regulations 2007. Regulation 3(2) amends regulation 11 of those Regulations to prescribe the manner in which parental consent to registration as a British overseas territories citizen under section 17D of the 1981 Act is to be signified. Regulation 3(3)(b) adds a requirement for certain applications under section 17(2) of the 1981 Act to contain information showing that the applicant is of good character. Regulation 3(3)(c) revokes paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the British Nationality (British Overseas Territories) Regulations 2007 to reflect amendments made to section 17 of the 1981 Act by section 5(1) of the 2022 Act. Regulation 3(3)(a), (d) and (e) makes provision about the information which must be contained in applications for registration as a British overseas territories citizen under section 17A, 17C, 17D, 17E, 17F, 17H or 17I of the 1981 Act or under paragraph 3A of Schedule 2 to that Act.
Regulation 4 amends the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018. It sets fees for particular applications for registration as a British citizen under section 4L of the 1981 Act and for applications for registration as a British citizen under paragraph 3A of Schedule 2 to that Act.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations because no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

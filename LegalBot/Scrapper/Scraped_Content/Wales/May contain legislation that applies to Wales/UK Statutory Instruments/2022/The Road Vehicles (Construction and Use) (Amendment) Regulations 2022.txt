21st January 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 (S.I. 1986/1078, the “1986 Regulations”) by making provision to allow certain vehicles on the roads in Great Britain to utilise elongated cabs and rear aerodynamic devices and equipment (type approved in accordance with the relevant standard) which improve aerodynamic performance, CO2 emissions, fuel consumption and driver vision.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 3 of the 1986 Regulations to define valid “aerodynamic devices and equipment” and “elongated cab” by reference to the standards given in underlying legislation. Additionally, valid aerodynamic devices and equipment are exempted from the calculation of “overall length”, and “overall width”.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 7 of the 1986 Regulations to provide that valid elongated cabs utilised on particular classes of vehicle or vehicle combination are exempted from the length requirements contained in regulation 7 that would otherwise apply; the overall length of a vehicle or vehicle combination will still be constrained by the turning circle requirements contained elsewhere in the 1986 Regulations.
Regulation 5 introduces a new regulation 96A and regulation 96B to the 1986 Regulations which prohibit the use on a road of aerodynamic devices and equipment or elongated cabs other than on the approved classes of vehicle or vehicle combination listed in the relevant item of the Table in regulation 7.
Good practice guidance on the use of aerodynamic devices and equipment has been published on www.gov.uk.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen. A De Minimis Assessment has been prepared. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

2nd August 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
Regulations 2 and 3 omit redundant references related to European Parliamentary elections in the Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 1986 (S.I. 1986/1111) and the Representation of the People (Combination of Polls) (England and Wales) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/294) respectively.
Regulation 4 omits redundant references to European Parliamentary elections and makes a consequential amendment in Schedule 4 to the Police and Crime Commissioner Elections Order 2012 (S.I. 2012/1917).
Regulation 5 omits a redundant amendment in the Combined Authorities (Mayoral Elections) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/67).
Regulation 6 revokes two redundant EU Regulations. The two EU Regulations were not properly revoked by the European Parliamentary Elections Etc. (Repeal, Revocation, Amendment and Saving Provisions) (United Kingdom and Gibraltar) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1310) (“the 2018 Regulations”). The 2018 Regulations came into force at the beginning of 31st December 2020, and at that time the two redundant EU Regulations did not form part of retained EU law. Regulation 6 also revokes the European Parliamentary Elections (Welsh Forms) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/704) and Council Decision (EU) 2018/994, both of which are redundant.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

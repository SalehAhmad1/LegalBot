(2) Permission to make a contempt application is required where the application is made in relation to—

(b)
an allegation of knowingly making a false statement in any affidavit, affirmation or other document verified by a statement of truth or in a disclosure statement.
(3) If permission to make the application is needed, the application for permission shall be included in the contempt application, which will proceed to a full hearing only if permission is granted.

(r)
that the court’s findings will be provided in writing as soon as practicable after the hearing; and

Service of a contempt application
21.5.—(1) Unless the court directs otherwise in accordance with Part 6 and except as provided in paragraph (2), a contempt application and evidence in support must be served on the defendant personally.
(2) Where a legal representative for the defendant is on the record in the proceedings in which, or in connection with which, an alleged contempt is committed—
(a)
the contempt application and evidence in support may be served on the representative or the defendant unless the representative objects in writing within seven days of receipt of the application and evidence in support;
(b)
if the representative does not object in writing, they must at once provide to the defendant a copy of the contempt application and the evidence supporting it and take all reasonable steps to ensure the defendant understands them;
(c)
if the representative objects in writing, the issue of service shall be referred to a judge of the court dealing with the contempt application; and the judge shall consider written representations from the parties and determine the issue on the papers, without (unless the judge directs otherwise) an oral hearing.
Cases where no application is made
21.6.—(1) If the court considers that a contempt of court (including a contempt in the face of the court) may have been committed, the court on its own initiative shall consider whether to proceed against the defendant in contempt proceedings.
(2)  Where the court does so, any other party in the proceedings may be required by the court to give such assistance to the court as is proportionate and reasonable, having regard to the resources available to that party.
(3) If the court proceeds on its own initiative, it shall issue a summons to the defendant which includes the matters set out in rule 21.4(2)(a)-(s) (in so far as applicable) and requires the defendant to attend court for directions to be given.
(4) A summons issued under this rule shall be served on the defendant personally and on any other party, unless the court directs otherwise. If rule 21.5(2) applies, the procedure there set out shall be followed unless the court directs otherwise.

21.7.—(1) The court shall give such directions as it thinks fit for the hearing and determination of contempt proceedings, including directions for the attendance of witnesses and oral evidence, as it considers appropriate.
(2) The court may issue a bench warrant to secure the attendance of the defendant at a directions hearing or at the substantive hearing.
(3) The court may not give any direction compelling the defendant to give evidence either orally or in writing.

21.8.—(1) All hearings of contempt proceedings shall, irrespective of the parties’ consent, be listed and heard in public unless the court otherwise directs, applying the provisions of paragraph (4).
(2) In deciding whether to hold a hearing in private, the court must consider any duty to protect or have regard to a right to freedom of expression which may be affected.
(3) The court shall take reasonable steps to ensure that all hearings are of an open and public character, save when a hearing is held in private.
(4) A hearing, or any part of it, must be held in private if, and only to the extent that, the court is satisfied of one or more of the matters set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (g) and that it is necessary to sit in private to secure the proper administration of justice—
(a)
publicity would defeat the object of the hearing;
(b)
it involves matters relating to national security;
(c)
it involves confidential information (including information relating to personal financial matters) and publicity would damage that confidentiality;
(d)
a private hearing is necessary to protect the interests of P, a protected party or any child;
(e)
it is a hearing of an application made without notice and it would be unjust to any respondent for there to be a public hearing;
(f)
it involves uncontentious matters arising in the administration of the affairs of P or in the administration of P’s estate; or
(g)
the court for any other reason considers this to be necessary to secure the proper administration of justice.
(5) The court must order that the identity of any party or witness shall not be disclosed if, and only if, it considers non-disclosure necessary to secure the proper administration of justice and in order to protect the interests of that party or witness.
(6) Unless and to the extent that the court otherwise directs, where the court acts under paragraph (4) or (5), a copy of the court’s order shall be published on the website of the Judiciary of England and Wales (which may be found at www.judiciary.uk). Any person who is not a party to the proceedings may apply to attend the hearing and make submissions or apply to set aside or vary the order.
(7) Advocates and the judge shall appear robed in all hearings of contempt proceedings, whether or not the court sits in public.
(8) Before deciding to sit in private for all or part of the hearing, the court shall notify the national print and broadcast media, via the Press Association.
(9) The court shall consider any submissions from the parties or media organisations before deciding whether and if so to what extent the hearing should be in private.
(10) If the court decides to sit in private it shall, before doing so, sit in public to give a reasoned public judgment setting out why it is doing so.
(11) At the conclusion of the hearing, whether or not held in private, the court shall sit in public to give a reasoned public judgment stating its findings and any punishment.
(12) The court shall inform the defendant of the right to appeal without permission, the time limit for appealing and the court before which any appeal must be brought.
(13) The court shall be responsible for ensuring that judgments in contempt proceedings are transcribed and published on the website of the judiciary of England and Wales.
Powers of the court in contempt proceedings
21.9.—(1) If the court finds the defendant in contempt of court, the court may impose a period of imprisonment (an order of committal), a fine, confiscation of assets or other punishment permitted under the law.
(2) Execution of an order of committal requires issue of a warrant of committal. An order of committal and a warrant of committal have immediate effect unless and to the extent that the court decides to suspend execution of the order or warrant.

(2) Any such application shall be made by an application notice under Part 10 in the contempt proceedings.
(3) The court hearing such an application shall consider all the circumstances and make such order under the law as it thinks fit.”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Court of Protection Rules 2017 (S.I. 2017/1035) to substitute for Part 21 of those Rules a new Part 21, for the purpose of making provision for a consistent approach in relation to contempt proceedings having regard to the relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998/3132 – see Part 81 as substituted by S.I. 2020/747) and the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (S.I. 2010/2955 – see Part 37 as substituted by S.I. 2020/758).
These Rules also make minor amendments in rules 6.3 and 9.1 of the Court of Protection Rules 2017, principally to clarify the rules for electronic service and to make reference to a new practice direction supplementing the Rules.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

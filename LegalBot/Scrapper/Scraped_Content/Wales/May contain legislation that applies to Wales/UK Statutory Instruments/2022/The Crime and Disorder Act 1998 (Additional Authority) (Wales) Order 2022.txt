23 March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends section 17(2) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (c. 37) (“the Act”) to add corporate joint committees established under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (asc 1) to the list of authorities in section 17(2) of the Act and as such are liable to comply with section 17(1).
Section 17(1) of the Act requires authorities that are subject to it, to have due regard to the likely effect of the exercise of their functions on, and the need to do all that it reasonably can to prevent crime and disorder in its area, the misuse of drugs, alcohol and other substances in its area, and reoffending in its area.
These Regulations are connected with regulations which established certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021. The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected orders and regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment was prepared at the time of making those establishment regulations and is relied upon for the purpose of this Order.

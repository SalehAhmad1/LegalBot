(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends the period for which the pilot scheme established under the Universal Credit (Work-Related Requirements) In Work Pilot Scheme and Amendment Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/89) (“the In Work Pilot Scheme Regulations”) has effect.
The In Work Pilot Scheme Regulations established the pilot scheme under section 41 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (c. 5) for the purpose of testing the imposition of work-related requirements on universal credit claimants in paid work where those requirements would otherwise be suspended by virtue of regulation 99(6) of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376). Regulation 8 of the In Work Pilot Scheme Regulations provides for the pilot scheme to cease to have effect at the end of a period of three years unless the scheme continues to have effect by Order of the Secretary of State. Four Orders made under section 41(5)(a) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 have continued the effect of the pilot scheme(1), the latest being the Universal Credit (Work-Related Requirements) In Work Pilot Scheme (Extension) Order 2021 (S.I. 2021/147), which continued the scheme in effect for a period of twelve months beginning on 19th February 2021.
Article 2 of this Order continues the effect of the pilot scheme for a further period of twelve months beginning on 19th February 2022.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

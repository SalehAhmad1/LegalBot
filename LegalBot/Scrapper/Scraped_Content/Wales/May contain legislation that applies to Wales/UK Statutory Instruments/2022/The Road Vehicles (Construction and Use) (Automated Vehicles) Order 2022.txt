(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides that the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 (S.I. 1986/1078) have effect in relation to automated vehicles as if certain modifications were made to regulation 109(1) (television sets). The effect of these modifications is that regulation 109 allows drivers of automated vehicles to be in such a position as to be able to see, whether directly or by reflection, information of any sort, provided that it is displayed on the built-in apparatus of a vehicle, that the vehicle is driving itself within the meaning of section 8(1)(a) of the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 (c. 18), and that the vehicle is not requesting the driver to take over control. This would otherwise be prohibited by regulation 109(1), contravention of which is an offence under section 42 (breach of other construction and use requirements) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (c. 52).

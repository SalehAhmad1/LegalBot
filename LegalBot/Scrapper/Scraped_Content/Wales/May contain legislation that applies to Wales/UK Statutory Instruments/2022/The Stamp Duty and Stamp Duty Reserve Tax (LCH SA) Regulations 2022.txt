(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations give relief from stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (“SDRT”) to certain transfers of, or agreements to transfer, traded securities or options made in the course of trading in those traded securities or options either on a facility or over the counter. The transfers and agreements eligible for relief are those involving LCH SA and its nominees (through whom transactions on the facility are cleared), or clearing participants of LCH SA and its nominees. LCH SA is a third country central counterparty which is authorised to operate in the UK by the Bank of England under the temporary recognition scheme established in regulation 17 of the Central Counterparties (Amendment, etc, and Transitional Provision) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1184).
Regulation 1 provides for citation, commencement and effect, and regulation 2 contains definitions.
Regulation 3 prescribes LCH SA as a “relevant entity” (as it is a third country central counterparty) for the purpose of the relief.
Regulation 4 prescribes the circumstances in which stamp duty and SDRT will not be charged.

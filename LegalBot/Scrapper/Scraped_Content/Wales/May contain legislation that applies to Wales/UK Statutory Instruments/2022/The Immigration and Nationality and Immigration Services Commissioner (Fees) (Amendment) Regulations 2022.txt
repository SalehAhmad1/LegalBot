S.I. 2020/1147.
(3)
S.I. 2020/966.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Immigration Services Commissioner (Application Fee) Order 2011 (“the 2011 Order”) and the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018 (“the 2018 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the 2011 Order, which sets the fees to be paid on making an application for registration or continued registration with the Immigration Services Commissioner under section 85 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. The amendments increase specified fees and make changes to definitions for the purposes of the fees specified in the Schedule to the 2011 Order. Regulation 2(2)(b) corrects an error in the definition of “registration” in the 2011 Order.
The remaining provisions of these Regulations amend the 2018 Regulations, which are concerned with the fees payable for the exercise of various functions in connection with immigration and nationality.
The amendments made by regulation 3(b) and Schedule 1 to these Regulations increase the amount of various fees specified by the 2018 Regulations, and also increase specified amounts required to be deducted from the fees payable for certain Health and Care Visa applications.
Regulations 4(a), 7(3) to (5) and 9(2)(a), (3) and (4) remove fees for specified documents and make amendments to fees for the recording or reuse of biometric information and to related fee exceptions.
Regulations 4(b), 6(4)(c) (in part), 7(2) and (6) and 9(2)(b) and (5) provide powers for the Secretary of State to waive certain specified fees so as to remedy any detriment connected with immigration or nationality which the Secretary of State considers an individual to have suffered as a result of maladministration by the Home Office.
The amendments made by regulations 5(3)(a) to (d) and 6(3) set fees for applications for entry clearance to enter, and limited leave to remain in, the United Kingdom under a number of new Appendices to the United Kingdom immigration rules. They also remove fees for applications for entry clearance and limited leave to remain under Appendix Intra-Company Routes, which has been removed from the rules. Regulation 11 makes related saving provision to preserve fees for applications by dependants of applicants under former Appendix Intra-Company Routes.
Regulation 5(3)(e) sets a new fee for applications for entry clearance and indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom as a foreign or Commonwealth citizen discharged from HM Forces. These applications are provided for by Appendix Armed Forces to the United Kingdom immigration rules. There is already a fee in the 2018 Regulations which covers applications for indefinite leave to remain under that Appendix. Amendments made by regulations 5(5)(b) and 6(4)(c) (in part) and (5) provide exceptions to the new fee and the existing fee in specified circumstances. Regulation 5(2) and (4) makes related amendments to an existing fee for applications by dependants of members of HM Forces, to take account of the fact that the applications in question under Appendix Armed Forces are for entry clearance as well as indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom.
Regulation 5(5)(a) removes a fee exception relating to applications for visit visas to attend the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021, which is no longer required.

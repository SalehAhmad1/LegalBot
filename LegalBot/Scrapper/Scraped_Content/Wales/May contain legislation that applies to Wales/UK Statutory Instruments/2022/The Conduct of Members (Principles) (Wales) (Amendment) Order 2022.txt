(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends article 2 of the Conduct of Members (Principles) (Wales) Order 2001 (“the Order”) to add corporate joint committees established under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (asc 1) to the list of relevant authorities, making the principles in the Schedule to the Order applicable to members of corporate joint committees.
The Schedule to the Order sets out the principles which govern the conduct of the members of relevant authorities in Wales.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected orders and regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment was prepared at the time of making those establishment regulations and is relied upon for the purpose of this Order.

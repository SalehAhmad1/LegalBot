(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (England) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/1294). Those amendments ensure that certain persons in the United Kingdom who have limited leave to remain granted in accordance with Appendix Ukraine Scheme of the Immigration Rules having made their immigration application from within the United Kingdom, are eligible for an allocation of housing accommodation and for housing assistance.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends the Persons subject to Immigration Control (Housing Authority Accommodation and Homelessness) Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/706). Those amendments enable housing authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland to provide housing accommodation and housing authorities in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland to provide homelessness assistance to those persons referred to above.

14th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend various provisions in primary legislation to take into account the new regulatory framework for banking companies.
Certain provisions of the tax code provide for specific rules for banking companies: sections 133A to 133N of the Corporation Tax Act 2009 (“CTA 2009”) (c. 4) provides for a restriction on deductions for compensation payments, Part 7A of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (“CTA 2010”) (c. 4) provides for a restriction on the use of losses and a corporation tax surcharge on banks, and Schedule 19 to the Finance Act 2011 (“FA 2011”) (c. 11) provides for a levy on the equity and liabilities of banks. These rules defined a banking company and banking group using definitions from the “Prudential Sourcebook for Investment Firms” within the Financial Conduct Authority Handbook (the IFPRU regulatory regime). This was replaced by the Investment Firms Prudential Regime (‘IFPR’) from 1 January 2022. Accordingly, these regulations amend the banking tax rules legislation to define a banking company and banking group by reference to the new regime.
The amendments made to the restriction on deductions for compensation payments apply from 1 January 2022. The amendments made to the restriction on the use of losses and the corporation tax surcharge on banks apply in relation to any accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Where accounting periods straddle 1 January 2022, the period before 1 January 2022 is treated as a separate accounting period to the period from 1 January 2022 to the end of the accounting period. Apportionments to these separate periods are to be made on a time basis or, if that method produces a result that is unjust or unreasonable, a just and reasonable basis. The amendments made to the bank levy apply in relation to any chargeable period ending on or after 1 January 2022. Authority for the retrospection is provided by section 133N(3A) of CTA 2009, section 269BE(1C) of CTA 2010 and paragraph 81(2)(c) of Schedule 19 to FA 2011.
There is an exception to the above. The changes being made in respect of a company’s operations of an organised trading facility are to apply in the same way as the provisions of the previous paragraph except that the words “1 January 2022” should be replaced with 5 April 2022.
A Tax Information and Impact Note covering this instrument will be published on the website at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tax-information-and-impact-notes-tiins.

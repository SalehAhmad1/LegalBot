(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Public Service (Civil Servants and Others) Pensions Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1964) established the new Civil Service pension scheme, also known as Alpha, and made provision for the contributions payable by members of that scheme up to 31st March 2021.
These Regulations provide for the member contribution rates for the scheme year ending on 31st March 2021 to also apply to the 1st April 2021 to 31st March 2022 scheme year, as against the revised annualised rate of pensionable earnings bands. Since these Regulations involve a change to a protected element of the scheme, the Minister for the Civil Service has consulted representatives of those likely to be affected by the change with a view to reaching agreement and has laid a report before Parliament.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

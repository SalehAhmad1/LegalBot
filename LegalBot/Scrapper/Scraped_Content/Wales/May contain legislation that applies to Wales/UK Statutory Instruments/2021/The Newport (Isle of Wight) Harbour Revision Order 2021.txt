(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, made on the application of the Isle of Wight Council (“the Council”), modernises and consolidates the statutory harbour powers applying in relation to Newport Harbour and provides for the following matters:
(1) Clarifying the limits of the harbour (article 3) including maps and plans of the harbour limits. The Order defines the limits of Newport Harbour by way of World Geodetic System coordinates (“WGS84”) and includes harbour premises (defined in article 2) but also requires the Council to maintain an illustrative plan showing the harbour limits and harbour premises, which must be updated within 30 days of any changes (article 3) and may be inspected at www.iow.gov.uk and, during working hours, at the principal office of the Council at County Hall, High Street, Newport, Isle of Wight PO30 1UD.
(2) Conferring on the Council and the harbour master (defined in article 2) powers of general and special direction for the regulation and management of the harbour (articles 4 to 10). General directions may be given by the Council for the purpose of promoting or securing conditions conducive to: the ease, convenience or safety of navigation; the safety of persons; the protection of property; or the prevention or amelioration of environmental harm in the harbour (article 4). Special directions may be given by the harbour master for various purposes related to the management of the harbour and the regulation of vessels using the harbour (article 7). A register of all in force general directions may be inspected during working hours at the harbour office of the Council (article 4).
(3) Creating an offence of failing to comply with special or general directions, the penalty for which is a fine on summary conviction not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale (article 8). A defence of due diligence is available to a person charged under article 8 (article 8(2)).
(4) Conferring on the Council appropriate general powers and functions for the management of the harbour (article 11).
(5) Incorporating provisions from the Harbours, Docks, Piers Clauses Act 1847 (article 12).

(8) Creating an offence of obstructing officers of the Council without reasonable excuse (article 16).

(10) To facilitate the above, the Order amends the Orders of 1968 and 1988 as set out in article 20.

29 April 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2A of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 enables the Welsh Ministers, by regulations, to make provision for the purpose of preventing, protecting against, controlling or providing a public health response to the incidence or spread of infection or contamination in Wales.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wales.
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 5) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1609 (W. 335)) (“the principal Regulations”).
The amendments provide that from 3 May 2021 the whole of Wales is fully at Alert Level 3 and the restrictions and requirements set out in Schedule 3 to the principal Regulations apply. The temporary (transitional) restrictions and requirements set out in Schedule 3A, which have applied to the whole of Wales since 27 March 2021, are revoked.
The move to the full Alert Level 3 restrictions in Schedule 3 means that from 3 May 2021—
any household may agree to be treated as an (exclusive) extended household with one other household, or with two other households if one of the households is a well-being needs household;
indoor organised activities are allowed for groups of up to 15 people, not counting persons under the age of 11;
organised activities for the development or well-being of children may also be held indoors;
community centres are allowed to also open their indoor premises;
indoor sports and exercise facilities are allowed to open.
The Regulations amend Schedule 3 to allow spas to open under the Alert Level 3 restrictions (but steam rooms are required to remain closed).
The Regulations also correct a minor error made in the amendment of paragraph 2(6)(k) of Schedule 2 to the principal Regulations by the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 5) (Wales) (Amendment) (No. 8) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/502 (W. 150)) and make a consequential amendment to the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (Functions of Local Authorities etc.) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1011 (W. 225)).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely cost and benefit of complying with these Regulations.

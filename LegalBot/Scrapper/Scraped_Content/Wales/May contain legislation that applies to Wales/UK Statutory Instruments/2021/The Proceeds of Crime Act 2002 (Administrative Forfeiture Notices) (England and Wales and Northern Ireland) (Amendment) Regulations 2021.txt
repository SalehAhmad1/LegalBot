(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Administrative Forfeiture Notices) (England and Wales and Northern Ireland) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/1223) (the “2017 Regulations”).
The 2017 Regulations, amongst other things, make provision for how account forfeiture notices are to be given under section 303Z9 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (c. 29). An account forfeiture notice may be given by a senior officer of the responsible enforcement body in question (such as, for example, the police or the Serious Fraud Office). It may be given in relation to accounts holding moneys where the senior officer is satisfied that the moneys are the proceeds of crime, or are intended to be used in unlawful conduct. An account freezing order must first have been made by a magistrates’ court. Where a senior officer gives an account forfeiture notice this can, in certain circumstances, lead to the forfeiture of such moneys.
The account forfeiture provisions were commenced for England and Wales and Scotland in 2018. Regulation 2 extends Part 2 of the 2017 Regulations to Northern Ireland, to reflect the commencement of the account forfeiture provisions in Northern Ireland.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

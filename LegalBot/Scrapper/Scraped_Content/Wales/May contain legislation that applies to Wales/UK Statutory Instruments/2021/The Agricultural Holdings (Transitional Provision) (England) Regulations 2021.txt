These Regulations are made in exercise of the power conferred by section 54(1) of the Agriculture Act 2020 to make transitional provisions in connection with the coming into force of provisions of that Act.

This transitional provision applies from the date on which these Regulations come into force until the date on which the first regulations made under section 39(8) of the 1986 Act which apply in England come into force.

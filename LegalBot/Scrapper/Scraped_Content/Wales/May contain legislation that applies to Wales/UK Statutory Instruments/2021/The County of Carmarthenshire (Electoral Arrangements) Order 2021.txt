(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the recommendations of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”), which reported in August 2019 on its review of the electoral arrangements for the County of Carmarthenshire. The Commission’s Report proposed a reduction in the number of electoral wards from 58 to 51, but an increase in the number of councillors from 74 to 75.
This Order implements the Commission’s recommendations, with modifications.
Article 3 of this Order abolishes the existing electoral arrangements for the County of Carmarthenshire and introduces the Schedule which sets out the new electoral arrangements for the County of Carmarthenshire.
This Order also implements recommendations for changes to electoral arrangements for the town of Llanelli within the County of Carmarthenshire.
Article 4 abolishes the community wards of Elli and Tyisha within the town of Llanelli and article 5 creates the new community wards of Elli and Tyisha. Article 6 sets out the number of members to be elected for the newly constituted wards in the town of Llanelli.
The Welsh Ministers’ code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.
Prints of the maps labelled 1 and 2 to which this Order relates are deposited in the office of the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ (Local Government Democracy Division), and with Carmarthenshire County Council. Prints deposited with Carmarthenshire County Council are open to inspection by anyone affected by the provisions of this Order.

At 11.00 a.m. on 16th December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of powers conferred by the Trade in Animals and Animal Products (Legislative Functions) and Veterinary Surgeons (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1225), in particular, regulation 7.
They amend Annex 1 to Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 laying down a list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which poultry and poultry products may be imported into and transit through the Community and the veterinary certification requirements to insert a date (referred to in that Regulation as an “opening date”). The effect of the opening date is that exports of poultry and poultry products from Australia produced after that date may be imported into Great Britain. The “opening date” is therefore a final date for the purposes of ending the application of provisions imposing restrictions on imports into Great Britain.
They also make additions for the entries to Ukraine in respect of restrictions on exports of poultry meat, the meat of farmed ratites and wild game-bird meat.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

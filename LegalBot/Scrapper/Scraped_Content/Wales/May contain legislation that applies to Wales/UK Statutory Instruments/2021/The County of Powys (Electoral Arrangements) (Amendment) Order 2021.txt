The Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales(1), in accordance with section 36(5) of the Local Government (Democracy) (Wales) Act 2013(2) (“the 2013 Act”), submitted to the Welsh Ministers a report dated March 2019 containing its recommendations for change and the details of its review of the electoral arrangements for the County of Powys.
The Welsh Ministers implemented those recommendations, with modifications, by making the County of Powys (Electoral Arrangements) Order 2021(3) (the “2021 Order”) under section 37(1) of the 2013 Act.
The Welsh Ministers are satisfied that a mistake has occurred in the preparation of the 2021 Order.

8 December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the County of Powys (Electoral Arrangements) Order 2021 (the “2021 Order”), which implemented the recommendations for changes to the electoral arrangements for the County of Powys, as contained within the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales Report of March 2019 (“the Report”), with modifications.
The Table in the Schedule to the 2021 Order (“the Table”) sets out the electoral arrangements for the County of Powys. Each electoral ward comprises the areas specified in column 3 of the Table in relation to that electoral ward. The Report mistakenly omitted certain information in relation to the electoral wards of Llandrinio, Llandysilio and Llansantffraid, which led to that information not appearing in column 3 of the Table. Article 2 of this Order rectifies that mistake.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

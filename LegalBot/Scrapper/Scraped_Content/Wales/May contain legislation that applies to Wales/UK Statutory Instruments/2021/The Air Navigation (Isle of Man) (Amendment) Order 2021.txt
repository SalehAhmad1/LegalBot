Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Air Navigation (Isle of Man) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/870) makes provision for the Isle of Man in relation to the registration, marking, airworthiness, equipment, manning, operation, movement and safety of aircraft and the licensing and welfare of flight crew.
The Airports and Civil Aviation Act 1987 (an Act of Tynwald), as amended by the Airports and Civil Aviation (Amendment) Act 2018, provides enabling powers so that the Isle of Man is able to make its own secondary legislation in relation to civil aviation.
This Order accordingly amends the Air Navigation (Isle of Man) Order 2015 to make way for the replacement provisions set out in the Civil Aviation (Rules of the Air) Order 2021 (SD No 2021/0184). This Order will commence on the same day that the Civil Aviation (Rules of the Air) Order 2021 comes into operation.

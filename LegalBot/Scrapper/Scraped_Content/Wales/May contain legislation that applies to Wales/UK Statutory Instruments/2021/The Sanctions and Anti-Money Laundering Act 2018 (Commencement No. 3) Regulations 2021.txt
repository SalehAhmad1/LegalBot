26th May 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force paragraph 8(4) of Schedule 3 to the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) (“the Act”). This provides for the repeal of sections 152 to 156 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 (c. 3).
The powers in section 152 to 156 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 enabled the government to make temporary provisions to implement United Nations (“UN”) financial sanctions without delay so that, while such sanctions were implemented in the United Kingdom by way of European Union Council Regulations, there was no implementation gap between the UN agreeing the sanctions and the European Union adopting them. These powers are no longer necessary since the United Kingdom has withdrawn from the European Union and the powers in the Act enable UN sanctions to be implemented by the United Kingdom directly.
Certain provisions of the Act came into force on Royal Assent by virtue of section 64(1) of the Act. Certain other provisions of the Act were brought into force by the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (Commencement No. 1) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1213 (C. 85)) and the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (Commencement No. 2) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1535 (C. 43)).NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT REGULATIONS

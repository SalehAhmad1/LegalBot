(5) For the purposes of paragraph (4) “the next financial year”, in relation to a financial year (“FY1”), is the financial year which begins immediately after the end of FY1 (this means, for example, that “the next financial year”, in relation to the financial year ending 31st March 2021, is the financial year ending 31st March 2022).
(6) An agreement must also include a term which prevents the contractor from sub-contracting any of its obligations to provide clinical services under the agreement unless—

where the sub-contractor is an individual, the sub-contract entered into by the contractor requires the individual to comply with the disclosure obligation for each relevant financial year in which the individual’s NHS earnings exceed the relevant threshold;
(b)
where the sub-contractor is a partnership, the sub-contract entered into by the contractor requires each sub-contractor partnership member of that partnership to comply with the disclosure obligation for each relevant financial year in which the sub-contractor partnership member’s NHS earnings exceed the relevant financial threshold;
(c)
in all cases, the sub-contract prohibits the sub-contractor (“S”) from sub-contracting, where permitted by paragraph 43(4A) of Schedule 2, any of the clinical services S has agreed with the contractor to provide under the sub-contract unless—

each sub-contractor partnership member, where S is a partnership,
to comply with the disclosure obligation for each relevant financial year in which the individual’s, or as the case may be, sub-contractor partnership member’s NHS earnings exceed the relevant threshold, and
(b)
a term which prevents S from sub-contracting obligations to provide clinical services under the contract, where permitted by paragraph 43(4A) of Schedule 2, unless—

where the sub-contractor is an individual (“I”), the sub-contract entered into by S requires I to comply with the disclosure obligation in relation to each financial year in which I’s earnings exceed the relevant threshold;
(ii)
where the sub-contractor is a partnership, the sub-contract entered into by S requires each sub-contractor partnership member to comply with the disclosure obligation in relation to each relevant financial year in which the sub-contractor partnership member’s NHS earnings exceed the relevant threshold.
(10) Nothing in paragraph (6), (7) or (9) requires any individual to comply with the disclosure obligation for any relevant financial year which—
(a)
ends before the individual or partnership (as the case may be) enters into a sub-contract with the contractor or a sub-contractor;
(b)

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1862) (“the GMS Regulations”) and the National Health Service (Personal Medical Services Agreements) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1879) (“the PMS Regulations”), which respectively make provision in respect of services provided under a general medical services contract and a personal medical services agreement pursuant to Part 4 of the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41). They apply in relation to England only.
The GMS Regulations and the PMS Regulations are amended so that such a contract or an agreement must contain a term requiring certain persons (medical practitioners and other individuals providing services pursuant to or in support of the contract or agreement) to disclose certain information to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (commonly known as NHS Digital) at a specified time if their annual earnings exceed a specified threshold. The Regulations also prescribe how those earnings are to be calculated. Similar provision is also required to be included in certain sub-contracts. (See Part 1 of Schedule 1 and Part 1 of Schedule 2.)
The GMS Regulations and the PMS Regulations are also amended—
(a)
to make provision for certain Crown servants who are posted overseas who are returning to the United Kingdom from their posting, and certain of their family members, to make an application to re-register with their GP practice either prior to their return or within three months of their return, or to make an advance application to register with a new GP practice (Part 2 of Schedule 1 and Part 2 of Schedule 2),
(b)
to make provision for certain Crown servants who are posted overseas, and certain of their family members, who are returning to the United Kingdom for no more than three months to make an advance application to register as a temporary resident with a GP practice whilst they are in the United Kingdom (Part 2 of Schedule 1 and Part 2 of Schedule 2),
(c)
to remove the patient consent requirement in relation to electronic repeat dispensing (Part 3 of Schedule 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 2),
(d)
to require contractors to have a secure method for communicating electronically with their patients, to put in place an online consultation tool for use by their patients, to put in place a video conferencing facility and to provide an electronic facility for patients to notify them of a change to their personal details (Part 4 of Schedule 1 and Part 4 of Schedule 2),
(e)
to require contractors to provide certificates of exemption from any requirement to be tested for, or vaccinated against, coronavirus to patients free of charge (Part 5 of Schedule 1 and Part 5 of Schedule 2), and
(f)
where a patient registers with a new practice, to require that the patient’s medical records are sent to the new practice within 28 days of the records being requested (Part 6 of Schedule 1 and Part 6 of Schedule 2).
Consequential and other minor amendments are also made to the GMS Regulations and the PMS Regulations. Minor amendments are also made to the GMS Regulations to correct drafting errors reported by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments in their Second Report of the 2021-22 Session (Part 6 of Schedule 1). Regulation 3 makes related transitional provision.
A full Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

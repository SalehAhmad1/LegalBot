Minister for Climate Change, one of the Welsh Ministers
16 June 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 and paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) and amend the Plant Health etc. (Fees) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1179) (W. 238) (“the 2018 Regulations”).
They make modifications, in consequence of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, to certain fees payable to the Welsh Ministers in relation to inspections of imports of plants, plant products or other objects.
In particular—
(a)
the fee payable by an importer in respect of each phytosanitary certificate or phytosanitary certificate for re-export accompanying a consignment is divided into separate fees payable in respect of a documentary check and an identity check (regulation 2(2)(a) and (b));
(b)
a new Schedule 1A is inserted into the 2018 Regulations to provide for fees payable by an importer in respect of a physical check and identity check of plants, plant products or other objects originating in an EU member State, Switzerland or Liechtenstein, including those which are subject to reduced checks, reflecting the level of inspection, based on the risk associated with those plants, plant products or other objects (regulation 2(2)(b) and (5)); and
(c)
Schedule 2 is substituted in the 2018 Regulations to provide for reduced fees in respect of an identity check of plants, plant products or other objects originating in a third country other than an EU member State, Switzerland or Liechtenstein, reflecting the existing level of inspection (regulation 2(2)(b) and (6)).
The fees payable by virtue of new regulation 3(2A)(a) of the 2018 Regulations are not payable in respect of consignments imported before 1 March 2022, in respect of certain plants or plant products.
The fees applicable in respect of physical checks and identity checks of consignments of certain plants, plant products or other objects from EU member States, Liechtenstein or Switzerland reflect the frequency rates of those checks as set out in the Official Controls, Plant Health, Seeds and Seed Potatoes (Amendment etc.) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/426).
These Regulations also provide an exemption from the payment of fees otherwise payable in respect of certification and pre-export services on phytosanitary consignments in certain circumstances. The exemption ceases to have effect at the end of 31 December 2022 (regulation 2(3)).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made under section 3 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (c. 23). Section 3 sets out the functions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

This Order amends that Schedule by specifying further offences for the purposes of section 3(3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.

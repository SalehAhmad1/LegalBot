(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (“the International Travel Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health Information for Persons Travelling to Wales etc.) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/595 (W. 136)) (“the Public Health Information Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. The requirements imposed by the International Travel Regulations are subject to exceptions, and certain categories of person are exempt from having to comply with certain requirements. “Regulation 2A travellers” are a category of person exempt from certain requirements. That category includes vaccinated travellers and travellers aged under 18.
These Regulations amend the International Travel Regulations so as to require pre-departure testing in relation to “regulation 2A travellers” aged 12 or over.
These Regulations also amend the time at which a pre-departure test must be taken to no more than 48 hours before departure.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations amends the Public Health Information Regulations in consequence of the amendments made to the International Travel Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Topcliffe, North Yorkshire 
because of the use of an unlit and unmarked tethered balloon for a military exercise which is 
scheduled to take place during the period 5th September to 17th September 2021 (inclusive). As 
the operation does not allow the balloon, or its tether, to be lit or marked the Civil Aviation 
Authority and Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in the vicinity of 
Topcliffe on the grounds of flight safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(a), the Flight Control Officer, 2 Signal 
Squadron, 32 Signal Regiment may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM).

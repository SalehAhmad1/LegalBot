SCHEDULE 3
PROCEDURE FOR DISCHARGE OF REQUIREMENTS
Application of this Schedule
1.  This Schedule applies to an application made by the undertaker to the planning authority (referred to in this Schedule as “the authority”) for an approval, consent or agreement required by any of the requirements.
Decision Period
2.—(1) The authority must give written notice to the undertaker of its decision on the application before the end of the decision period.
(2) In sub-paragraph (1), “the decision period” means—
(a)
where the authority does not give written notice under paragraph 3(1) or (2) requiring further information, the period of eight weeks from the later of—
(i)
the day immediately following the day on which the authority receives the application, and
(ii)
the day on which the authority receives the fee payable under paragraph 4; or
(b)
where the authority gives written notice under paragraph 3(1) or (2) requiring further information, the period of eight weeks from the day immediately following the day on which the undertaker provides the further information; or
(c)
such longer period as may be agreed in writing by the undertaker and the authority.
Further information
3.—(1) If the authority considers that it requires further information to make a decision on the application, it must give written notice to the undertaker specifying the further information required within seven business days from the day on which it receives the application.
(2) If the relevant requirement requires that authority to consult a person (referred to in this Schedule as a “consultee”) in relation to the application—
(a)
the authority must consult the consultee within five business days from the day on which it receives the application;
(b)
if the consultee considers that it requires further information to respond to the consultation, it must so notify the authority, specifying what further information is required, within 18 business days from the day on which the authority received the application; and
(c)
within five business days from the day on which it receives any such notification from the consultee, the authority must give written notice to the undertaker specifying the further information required by the consultee.
(3) If the authority, after consultation with any consultee, considers that further information provided by the undertaker in response to a written notice from the authority under sub-paragraph (1) or (2) is not sufficient to allow it to make a decision on the application, it must give written notice to the undertaker specifying what further information is still required, within seven business days from the day on which the undertaker provided the information.
(4) If the authority does not give written notice in accordance with sub-paragraph (1), (2) or (3), it is not entitled to request any additional information in relation to the application without the prior agreement in writing of the undertaker.
Fees
4.—(1) The undertaker must pay the authority a fee of £116, or such greater fee as for the time being is payable to the authority in respect of an application for the discharge of a condition imposed on a grant of planning permission, in respect of each application.
(2) The authority must refund the fee paid under sub-paragraph (1) to the undertaker, within the relevant period, if it—
(a)
rejects the application as being invalidly made;
(b)
fails to give the written notice required by paragraph 2(1).
(3) Sub-paragraph (2) does not apply if, within the relevant period, the undertaker agrees in writing that the authority may retain the fee paid and credit it in respect of a future application.
(4) In sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) “the relevant period” means the period of eight weeks from, as the case may be—
(a)
the day on which the authority rejects the application as being invalidly made;
(b)
the day after the day on which the decision period expires.

(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules make amendments to the Firearms Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998/1941).
Rule 2(2) and (3) amends the Firearms Rules 1998 in order to clarify the condition imposed on the grant or renewal of a firearm or shotgun certificate, requiring the holder of the certificate to inform the chief officer of police by whom the certificate was granted as soon as reasonably practicable but in any event within seven days, of the theft, loss, or destruction in Great Britain of the certificate, and of the theft, loss, deactivation or destruction in Great Britain of any firearm, shotgun or ammunition to which the certificate relates. The addition of the words “in any event” provide clarity that the notification must be made as soon as reasonably practicable, with seven days being the maximum period for notification.
Rule 2(4) and (5) replaces the existing firearm and shotgun certificates. The purpose of making these changes is to ensure that additional information is recorded on the certificate about the weapons listed therein. This includes the unique identifying mark as applied to the weapon’s frame or receiver and, where different, the unique identifying mark as applied to each relevant component part. The changes also reflect the amendment made to the condition in rule 2(2) and (3) and update the guidance and note sections of certificates.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

Section 16 is also modified to give OFCOM the powers to ensure that the Multiplex 2 licence continues to be held by a company controlled by one or more public service broadcasters.
This Order also modifies Part 1 of that Act to give OFCOM the power to revoke the Multiplex A, B, C, D and Multiplex 2 licences for spectrum management reasons where such licences have been renewed on a second occasion. Section 16A sets out the procedure to be followed by OFCOM which provides for a notice period of five years, allows for representations from the licence holder, and ensures that the revocation cannot take effect earlier than 31st December 2030.

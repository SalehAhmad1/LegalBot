(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Information-sharing in relation to Welfare Services etc.) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/1483). They are being issued free of charge as they rectify errors in those Regulations.
Regulation 2(2) and (3) make amendments to the heading to Part 3 and regulation 6(1) (holding purposes) so that the purposes for which information must be held by a local authority or other ‘qualifying person’, in order for those persons to use or supply it, encompass those relating to both ‘welfare services’ and housing benefit. See sections 131(11) and (12) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (c. 5) for the definitions of ‘qualifying person’ and ‘welfare services’.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

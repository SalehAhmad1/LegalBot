Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply with the necessary modifications as respects compensation in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A)(1) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 5 to the Network Rail (Teddington Station Access for All) Order 2021 (“the 2021 Order”)),
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 5 to the 2021 Order) to acquire an interest in the land, and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(2) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken” substitute “a right over land is purchased”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 6 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 5(1) (power to acquire land) applies to a compulsory acquisition of rights under article 8 (power to acquire new rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in the case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act regard must be had, not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 6(1) (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)), they have power, exercisable in the same circumstances and subject to the same conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4)(counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5)(penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13 (refusal to give possession to the acquiring authority) of that Act are modified accordingly.
(6) Section 20(6) (protection for interests of tenants at will etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 6) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—

the owner or occupier of premises the drains of which communicated with that sewer; or
(b)
the owner of a private sewer which communicated with that sewer,
is entitled to recover from Network Rail compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of making the drain or sewer belonging to that person communicate with any other public sewer or with a private sewerage disposal plant.

apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.

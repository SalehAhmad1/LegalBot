5th August 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments in the fields of ecodesign and energy labelling in order to implement the Northern Ireland/Ireland Protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement (“the Protocol”).
The Protocol provides that the provisions of EU law listed in Annex 2 to the Protocol shall apply to Northern Ireland. This is given effect by section 7A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16). Annex 2 to the Protocol includes Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products and Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2017 setting a framework for energy labelling and repealing Directive 2010/30/EU.
The Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2617) (“the 2010 Regulations”) and the Energy Information Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1524) (“the 2011 Regulations”) provide for the domestic implementation of those instruments.
These Regulations amend the tables in Schedule 1 to the 2010 Regulations and Schedule 1 to the 2011 Regulations to ensure that the market surveillance authorities in Northern Ireland can enforce the relevant EU measures for energy-related products. The references to EU measures inserted by these Regulations are ambulatory, with the result that they will keep pace with any subsequent amendments to those measures made by the EU.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021 (“the International Travel Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 (“the Notification Regulations”).
Regulation 3 amends regulation 2A of the International Travel Regulations to exempt certain arrivals from category 2 countries who have received a complete course of a vaccine which is not an authorised vaccine from certain testing and self-isolation requirements. It also removes the exclusion for travellers from Metropolitan France, so that such travellers are treated in the same manner as other category 2 arrivals.
Regulation 4 makes consequential amendments to regulation 17A of the International Travel Regulations to take account of the lifting of restrictions on travellers from Metropolitan France.
Regulations 5 and 6 amend Schedules 1 and 3 to the International Travel Regulations to amend the list of places designated as category 1 (“green-list”) and category 3 (“red-list”) countries and territories. Regulation 9 makes consequential changes to Schedule 13 to the International Travel Regulations to prohibit the arrival of aircraft and vessels into England from red-list countries.
Regulation 7 updates the list of sporting events in Schedule 5 to the International Travel Regulations.
Regulation 8 amends paragraph 18(3) of Schedule 11 to the International Travel Regulations to include children who attend boarding school in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, as well as in England.
Regulation 10 makes minor amendments to regulation 4ZA of the Notification Regulations.

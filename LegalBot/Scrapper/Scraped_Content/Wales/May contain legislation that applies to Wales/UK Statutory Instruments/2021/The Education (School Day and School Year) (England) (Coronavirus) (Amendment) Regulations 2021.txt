(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (School Day and School Year) (England) Regulations 1999 (“the 1999 Regulations”), which set out the minimum number of school sessions that must be held during a school year in every school maintained by a local authority and every special school not maintained by a local authority.
Regulation 3(2) of these Regulations amends regulation 3(6) of the 1999 Regulations and inserts a new paragraph (7). The effect is to reduce the minimum number of sessions which must be held in the school year 2021-2022 from 380 to 378. This is to enable relevant schools to close for the additional bank holiday announced on 12th November 2020 to take place on 3rd June 2022 to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen. This amendment also preserves similar reductions that were made in previous regulations for the school years 2010-2011 and 2011-2012.
Regulation 3(3) of these Regulations amends regulation 4 of the 1999 Regulations. The effect is that up to two sessions in the school year 2020-2021 can be counted towards the minimum number of sessions held during that year even if they are devoted wholly or mainly to the training of teachers rather than the teaching of pupils. This is so that where a relevant school held an additional “inset” day on 4th January 2021 to help teachers train and prepare for coronavirus testing in schools this is counted as a session for which the school met.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

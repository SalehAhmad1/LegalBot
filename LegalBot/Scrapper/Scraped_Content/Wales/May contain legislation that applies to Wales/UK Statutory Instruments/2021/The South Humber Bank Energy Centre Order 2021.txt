(a)
the character of the street including the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;

the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;

(2) The appeal process is to be as follows—
(a)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the requirement which is the subject of the appeal (together with the undertaker, these are the “appeal parties”);
(b)
as soon as is practicable after receiving the appeal documentation, the Secretary of State must appoint a person (“the appointed person”) to determine the appeal and must notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for their attention should be sent, the date of such notification being the “start date” for the purposes of this paragraph (2);
(c)
the relevant planning authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the requirement which is the subject of the appeal must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within ten working days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(d)
the appeal parties must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within ten working days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph (c); and

(6) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal; or
(b)

(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits.

(9) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(10) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this article, it is to be deemed to be an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 as if it had been given by the relevant planning authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.
(11) Save where a direction is given pursuant to paragraph (12) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(12) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to Planning Practice Guidance: Appeals (March 2014) or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

(8) Where National Grid requires any protective works to be constructed by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved under this paragraph, must be carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part of the authorised works) for which protective works are required and National Grid must give 56 days’ notice of such works from the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 10 to 12 and 14 to 16 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 15(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the construction of the authorised works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in section 52 of the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must—
(a)
comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and

Expenses
18.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid:
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 14(3); or
(ii)
exercising any powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the constructing any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the construction of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works; and
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 29 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs must be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid or under its supervision does not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless National Grid fails to construct the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and

(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and without the consent of the undertaker.
(5) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 19 applies where it is within National Grid’s reasonable gift and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Grid’s control.

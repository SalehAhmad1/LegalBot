(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Criminal Legal Aid (Remuneration) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/435) (“the Remuneration Regulations”).
The Remuneration Regulations make provision for remuneration for advice and assistance made available under sections 13 (advice and assistance for individuals in custody) and 15 (advice and assistance for criminal proceedings) of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (c. 10) (“the Act”). Regulation 8 of those Regulations includes provision that a claim for such remuneration must be made and determined in accordance with the 2017 Standard Crime Contract (the contract between the Lord Chancellor and a person with whom the Lord Chancellor has made an arrangement under section 2(1) of the Act for the provision of advice and assistance made available under sections 13 and 15 of the Act), and paid in accordance with the rates set out in Schedule 4 to those Regulations.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends Schedule 4 to the Remuneration Regulations to provide for remuneration rates and an upper limit for advice and assistance for pre-charge engagement work.

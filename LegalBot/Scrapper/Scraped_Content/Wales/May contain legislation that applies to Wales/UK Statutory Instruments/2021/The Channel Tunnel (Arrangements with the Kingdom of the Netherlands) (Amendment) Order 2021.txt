(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements into United Kingdom law the provisions of the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands concerning Border Controls on Rail Traffic between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom using the Channel Fixed Link, done at the Hague on 10 July 2020 (the “Bilateral Agreement”) that relate to officer powers.
Article 2 amends the Channel Tunnel (Arrangements with the Kingdom of the Netherlands) (Amendment) Order 2020 (S.I. 2020/916)(“the 2020 Order”) to insert a new Schedule 2 setting out the powers available to officers of both Contracting Parties while carrying out their functions in the territory of the other State. It also provides for this Schedule to be revoked from the date upon which the Agreement between the Government of the French Republic, the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland amending and supplementing the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Government of the French Republic concerning Rail Traffic between Belgium and the United Kingdom using the Channel Fixed Link with Protocol, done at Brussels on 15 December 1993, done at Brussels (“the Quadripartite Agreement”) on 7 July 2020 comes into force. The Quadripartite Agreement makes separate provision for these powers from the date on which it comes into force. Finally, it inserts two paragraphs of Article 16 of the Bilateral Agreement into Schedule 1 of the 2020 Order. Those paragraphs confirm that parts of the Agreement shall also cease to have effect from the date on which the Quadripartite Agreement comes into force.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

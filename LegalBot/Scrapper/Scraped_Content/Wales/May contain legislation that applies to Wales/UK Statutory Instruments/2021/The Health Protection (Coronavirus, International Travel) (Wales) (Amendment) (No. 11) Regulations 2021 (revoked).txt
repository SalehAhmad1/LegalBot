(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (“the International Travel Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales to isolate for a period determined in accordance with those Regulations. The requirements imposed by the International Travel Regulations are subject to exceptions, and certain categories of person are exempt from having to comply.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations makes amendments to regulation 2A (exemptions for vaccinated travellers and others) of the International Travel Regulations, including extending the recognition of vaccinations to further countries and territories as well as the United Nations vaccination programme, and making further technical amendments.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations amends regulation 6A (requirement to possess notification of a negative test result) of the International Travel Regulations relating to the evidence that may be provided of pre-departure tests.
Non-exempt persons are prohibited from entering Wales where they have been in a country or territory listed in Schedule 3A (countries and territories subject to additional measures) to the International Travel Regulations within the last 10 days of arrival, pursuant to regulation 12E (additional measures applicable to persons travelling from a country or territory listed in Schedule 3A) of the International Travel Regulations. Regulation 5 of these Regulations amends Schedule 3A to remove various countries from the list of countries or territories to which regulation 12E applies.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

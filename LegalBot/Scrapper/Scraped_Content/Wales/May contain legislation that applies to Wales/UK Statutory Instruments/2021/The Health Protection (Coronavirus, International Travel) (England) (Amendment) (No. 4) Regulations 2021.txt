(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) (“the International Travel Regulations”) to remove all countries, territories, regions and islands from the list of exempt places, in Schedule A1, from which passengers arriving in England are not required to self-isolate. From 4.00 a.m. on 18th January 2021, anyone arriving in England from outside the common travel area will be required to self-isolate (by regulation 4 of the International Travel Regulations) unless specifically exempt.
This instrument also removes several exemptions from the requirement to self-isolate (in Schedule 2 to the International Travel Regulations) and amends the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/47) to remove an exemption that was due to come into force at 4.00 a.m. on 16th January 2021.

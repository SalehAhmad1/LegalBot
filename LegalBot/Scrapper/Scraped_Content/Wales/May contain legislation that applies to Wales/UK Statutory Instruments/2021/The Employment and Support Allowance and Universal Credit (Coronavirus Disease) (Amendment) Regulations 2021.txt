18th October 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit (Coronavirus Disease) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/289).
Regulation 2 of the Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit (Coronavirus Disease) Regulations 2020 gives the Secretary of State discretion to disapply the seven waiting days that would otherwise apply to a person who has made a claim for an employment and support allowance. Regulation 3 of those Regulations gives the Secretary of State discretion to decide that a person who makes a claim for, or is entitled to, employment and support allowance may be treated as a person having limited capability for work. Both provisions apply where a person is infected or contaminated with Coronavirus disease, is isolating to prevent the spread of Coronavirus disease, or is caring for a child (or qualifying young person) who falls into either of those categories. Regulation 3 no longer has effect in relation to Universal Credit by virtue of the Social Security (Coronavirus) (Further Measures) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/371).
Following a review by the Secretary of State of the operation of the Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit (Coronavirus Disease) Regulations 2020, regulation 2 amends the expiry date of the Regulations so that they now expire on 24th March 2022.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

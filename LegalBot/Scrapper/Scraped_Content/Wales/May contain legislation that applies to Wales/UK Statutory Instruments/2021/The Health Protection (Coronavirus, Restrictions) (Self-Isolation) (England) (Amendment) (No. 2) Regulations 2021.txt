The Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 45C(1) and (3)(c), 45D, 45F(2), 45P and 45T(6) of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984(1), makes the following Regulations.

In accordance with section 45R of that Act, the Secretary of State is of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.

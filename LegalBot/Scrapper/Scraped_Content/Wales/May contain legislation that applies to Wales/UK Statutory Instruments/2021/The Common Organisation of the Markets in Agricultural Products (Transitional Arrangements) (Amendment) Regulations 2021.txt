31st May 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(d) and (9)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to transitional arrangements in the area of agricultural market measures and organics to align the new import requirements following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU with the Government’s revised timetable for introducing import border control checks on imports from the EU (the Border Operating Model). Part 2 amends retained EU legislation to amend the transitional arrangements relating to the import of organic products, hops, fruit and vegetables and wine. Part 3 amends subordinate legislation relating to the certification of hops.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
The Regulations make amendments to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/433) (“the Democratic Republic of the Congo Regulations”) which were made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act.
The Regulations amend the Democratic Republic of the Congo Regulations to insert into regulation 4(4) a reference to paragraph 3 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2582 (2021), adopted on 29 June 2021 (“Resolution 2582”). That paragraph decides that the financial and travel sanctions in paragraphs 9 and 11 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1807 (2008), adopted on 31 March 2008 (“Resolution 1807”), shall also apply to individuals and entities designated by the relevant UN Sanctions Committee for planning, directing, sponsoring or participating in attacks against medical personnel or humanitarian personnel. The amendments made by these Regulations enable implementation of the UK’s UN obligations in respect of financial sanctions.
The Regulations also correct a reference in regulation 10(1) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Regulations to refer to the asset-freeze provision of Resolution 1807.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

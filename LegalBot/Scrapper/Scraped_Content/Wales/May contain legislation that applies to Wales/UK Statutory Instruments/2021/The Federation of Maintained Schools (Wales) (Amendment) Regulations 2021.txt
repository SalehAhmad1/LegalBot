(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Federation of Maintained Schools (Wales) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1132 (W. 111)).
These Regulations provide that for federations consisting of only two schools, a person may be elected as a teacher or staff governor despite working at the same federated school as a previous teacher or staff governor who served within the past two years.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

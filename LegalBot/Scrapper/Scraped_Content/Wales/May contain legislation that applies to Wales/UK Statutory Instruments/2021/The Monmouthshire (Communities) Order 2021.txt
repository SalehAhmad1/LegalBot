2 November 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, made in accordance with section 58(2) of the Local Government Act 1972, implements the proposals of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”), which reported in January 2019 on a review of community arrangements in the County of Monmouthshire conducted by Monmouthshire County Council. The Commission’s Report recommended changes to the existing boundaries of communities within the area of Monmouthshire County Council and consequential changes to electoral arrangements, and this Order implements the Commission’s recommendations without modification.
The effect of this Order is to make changes to a number of community areas and consequential changes to electoral arrangements. This Order also dissolves a number of communities and their community councils, creates new communities and new community councils and makes administrative provision for the operation of, and setting of precepts relating to, those new community councils.
The Local Government Area Changes Regulations 1976 referred to in article 2 of this Order contain incidental, consequential, transitional and supplementary provisions about the effect and implementation of orders such as this.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.
Prints of the maps labelled “1” to “166” to which this Order relates are deposited in the office of the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ (Local Government Democracy Division), and with Monmouthshire County Council. Prints deposited with Monmouthshire County Council are open to inspection by anyone affected by the provisions of this Order.

22nd February 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order changes the year of the ordinary elections of councillors of Cumbria County Council, Carlisle City Council and South Lakeland District Council.
Article 3 provides that the ordinary election of councillors for those councils, which would have taken place in 2021 will instead take place in 2022. The years in which subsequent ordinary elections of councillors for those councils take place are not changed by this Order.
Article 4 provides that councillors, who would have retired in 2021, will instead retire in 2022.
Article 5 makes consequential provision, modifying the application of the Local Government and Police and Crime Commissioner (Coronavirus) (Postponement of Elections and Referendums) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/395). The modification allows by-elections to the relevant councils which have been postponed to the ordinary day of election of councillors in 2021 to take place on that day.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument will have no impact on the costs of business and the voluntary sector. The impact on the public sector is potentially positive as, if a decision is subsequently made to abolish Cumbria County Council, Carlisle City Council or South Lakeland District Council, it will save the costs of holding elections for new councillors who could be members of those councils for short terms, before they are dissolved.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007 concerning the export for recovery of certain waste listed in Annex III or IIIA to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (“Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006”) to certain countries to which the OECD Decision on the control of transboundary movements of wastes does not apply (“Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007”) forms part of domestic law on and after IP completion day (11 p.m. on 31st December 2020) (see section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16).
These Regulations amend the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007 to set out export control procedures for a new category of sorted, non-hazardous, plastic waste classified as B3011, which had previously been a subset of classification B3010.
These Regulations also amend both Annex 7 to Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 and the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1418/2007 in order to remove defunct references to plastic waste classified as B3010, which is no longer a classification used in the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, adopted on 22nd March 1989(1), amended by Decision BC-14/12(2).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

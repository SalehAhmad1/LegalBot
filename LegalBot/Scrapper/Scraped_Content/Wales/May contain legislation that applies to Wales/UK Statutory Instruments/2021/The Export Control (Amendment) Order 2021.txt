(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Export Control Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/3231) (“the 2008 Order”).
Article 2(2) to (21) amends Schedule 2 to the 2008 Order which lists military goods, software and technology subject to export controls (“the military list”). The content of the military list reflects both domestic controls and an international export regime known as the Wassenaar Arrangement. Amendments to the Wassenaar Arrangement munitions list were most recently agreed in December 2019. The substituted text reflects those changes, including the insertion of new definitions and further technical notes.
Article 2(22) to (25) amends Schedule 3 to the 2008 Order which lists UK controlled dual-use goods, software and technology. The new text amends these national controls to provide further clarity regarding the interpretation of PL9009, particularly in relation to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
An Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is available from the Export Control Organisation, 3 Whitehall Place, London SW1A 2AW and, also, is published alongside the instrument on the www.legislation.gov.uk website. In addition, a copy has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

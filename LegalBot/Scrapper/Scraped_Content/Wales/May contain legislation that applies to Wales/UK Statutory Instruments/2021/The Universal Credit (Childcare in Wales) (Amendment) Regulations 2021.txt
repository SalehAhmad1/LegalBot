2nd March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 35 of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376).
Regulation 2 amends the definition of “relevant childcare” (specifically in relation to care provided in Wales) for the purposes of claiming childcare costs in universal credit. The definition currently includes care by childcare providers who have been approved in accordance with a scheme then made by the then National Assembly for Wales under a power in the Tax Credits Act 2002. That power, which had been relied upon to create a scheme to approve home childcare providers (i.e. nannies), has now been repealed subject to saving provisions. This amendment adds the power that will be used for the replacement scheme into the definition of “relevant childcare” so that universal credit claimants in Wales who use a nanny to provide childcare can continue to be reimbursed for childcare costs once the new scheme takes effect. By including the power to establish approval schemes within the definition, the amendment would also enable universal credit claimants to be reimbursed if using a childcare provider approved under other schemes made by the Welsh Ministers.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

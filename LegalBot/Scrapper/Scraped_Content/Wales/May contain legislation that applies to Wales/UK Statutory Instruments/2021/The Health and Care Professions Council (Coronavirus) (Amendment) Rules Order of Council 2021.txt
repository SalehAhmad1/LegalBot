RegistrarEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order approves Rules made by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). The Rules amend the procedural rules for the HCPC's three Practice Committees, which conduct fitness to practise proceedings, and the procedural rules for its Appeal Panel, which hears appeals against registration decisions.
The amendments to all four sets of procedural rules are in similar form and make two changes. They provide for the service by electronic means of notices and other documents relating to fitness to practise and appeals proceedings and enable the Practice Committees and Appeal Panel to conduct hearings and meetings by audio or video conference in an emergency. The amendments also allow committees to order that hearings and meetings held by audio or video conference are to be held in private.

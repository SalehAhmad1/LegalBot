At 12.05 p.m. on 13th September 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Schedules 5 and 11 to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/582).
The amendment to Schedule 5 updates the list of specified sporting events.
As a result of the amendments to Schedule 11, the additional measures that apply to arrivals from category 3 countries and territories do not apply to international elite sportspersons who travel to or through a category 3 country or territory to compete in an elite sports event, if they thereafter travel to England to compete in a UEFA Champions League, Europa League or Europa Conference League match.
Paragraphs 2(1)(h), (j), (k) and (zn) of Schedule 11 cross-refer to definitions in paragraph 44(2) of Schedule 4. The amendments also modify the effect these definitions have when used in Schedule 11, to ensure they apply to persons arriving in England from category 3 countries and territories.

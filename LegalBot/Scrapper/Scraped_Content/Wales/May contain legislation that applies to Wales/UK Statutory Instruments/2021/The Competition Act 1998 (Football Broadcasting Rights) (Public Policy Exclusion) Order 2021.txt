The Chapter II prohibition precludes conduct on the part of one or more undertakings which amounts to abuse of a dominant position in a market if it may affect trade within the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State, where satisfied that there are exceptional and compelling reasons of public policy for doing so, may exclude an agreement, decision or concerted practice, or an agreement, decision or concerted practice of a particular description, from the Chapter I prohibition, and specified conduct from the Chapter II prohibition.

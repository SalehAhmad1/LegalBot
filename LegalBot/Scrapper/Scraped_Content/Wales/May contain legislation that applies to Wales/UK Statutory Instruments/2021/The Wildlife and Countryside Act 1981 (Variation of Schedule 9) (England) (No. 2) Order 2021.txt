(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, which applies in England, varies Part 1 of Schedule 9 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (c. 69) (“the Act”), which lists non-native animals which are established in the wild which may not be released or allowed to escape into the wild unless authorised by a licence. Article 2 adds common pheasant and red legged partridge to Part 1 of Schedule 9 to the Act, but only in relation to areas of England that are European sites or are within 500 metres of the boundary of these sites.
Article 3 requires the Secretary of State to review the operation and effectiveness of the variation to Schedule 9 to the Act made by this Order and publish a report before 30th May 2024. Following the review it will fall to the Secretary of State to consider whether the Order should be allowed to expire as Article 4 provides, be revoked early, or continue in force with or without amendment. A further instrument would be needed to continue the Order in force with or without amendments or to revoke it early.
An impact assessment has been prepared in relation to this Order and is being validated by the Regulatory Policy Committee. It will be placed in the library of each House of Parliament and on the gov.uk website.

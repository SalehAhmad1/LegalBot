6th January 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (Judicial Offices) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/580) (“the 2015 Order”). The 2015 Order specifies those judicial offices which comprise “the judiciary” for the purposes of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25). A person holding a judicial office specified in the Schedule to the 2015 Order may be eligible to be included in a judicial pension scheme made under that Act.
Regulation 2 adds various judicial offices (“the new judicial offices”) to the list of specified judicial offices in the 2015 Order so that holders of those offices can participate in the Judicial Pension Scheme 2015 (“the Scheme”) (established under the Judicial Pensions Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/182) (“the 2015 Regulations”)) from 1st April 2021. Regulation 2 also corrects errors in the 2015 Order by omitting two erroneous entries and making other amends.
These Regulations also amend the 2015 Regulations so that at the same time as these new judicial offices are included in the Scheme from 1st April 2021, a mechanism is provided for the Lord Chancellor to provide for service in the same roles between 1st April 2015 and 31st March 2021 to be pensionable, even though those judicial offices were not included in the Scheme during that time.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

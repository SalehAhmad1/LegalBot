(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Charities (Exception from Registration) Regulations 1996. They extend the temporary exception granted to certain religious charities from the requirement to be registered under the Charities Act 2011. The 1996 Regulations were made under the Charities Act 1993, which is consolidated in the Charities Act 2011. The exception was originally due to expire on 1st March 2001 but was extended by successive statutory instruments until 31st March 2021. These Regulations further extend the temporary exception until 31st March 2031.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations as no impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (the “International Travel Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Pre-Departure Testing and Operator Liability) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/48 (W. 11)) (the “Operator Liability Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales from non-exempt countries or territories to isolate for a period determined in accordance with those Regulations.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 2A of the International Travel Regulations to introduce exemptions for certain travellers, primarily those who have received a full course of an authorised vaccine in, or who are under 18 and ordinarily resident in, a relevant country. Such travellers are exempted from the requirement to isolate on return from a non-exempt country or territory (except one specified in Schedule 3A to the International Travel Regulations), and are only required to take a day 2 test. These exemptions therefore apply in relation to relevant arrivals from what are commonly known as the ‘amber list’ countries.
The Operator Liability Regulations impose requirements on persons operating international passenger services (“operators”) arriving into Wales from outside the common travel area. In accordance with those requirements operators must, for example, ensure that passengers travelling on such services possess notification of a negative test result and have made arrangements to take further tests following their arrival.
Regulations 4 to 9 of these Regulations amend the Operator Liability Regulations to place duties on operators of international passenger services to check, (i) that a person who has declared that they are an eligible vaccinated arrival within the meaning of regulation 2A of the International Travel Regulations has the evidence required to support that declaration; and (ii) that passengers seeking to rely on an exemption in Schedule 2 to the International Travel Regulations possess evidence that they are eligible for the exemption.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

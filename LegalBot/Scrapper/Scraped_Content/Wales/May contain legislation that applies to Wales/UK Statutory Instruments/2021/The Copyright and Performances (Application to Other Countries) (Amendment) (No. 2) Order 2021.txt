(This note is not part of the Order)
Part 1 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (“the Act”) confers the protection of copyright on the creators of certain works (“Part 1 protections”). It applies to works originating from certain countries and is applied by the Copyright and Performances (Application to Other Countries) Order 2016 (“the 2016 Order”), made under powers conferred by the Act, to works originating from certain other countries. Part 2 of the Act confers the protection of rights on performers and persons having recording rights in relation to a performance (“Part 2 protections”). It applies to performances connected with certain countries and is also applied by the 2016 Order to performances connected with certain other countries.
This Order amends the 2016 Order as follows. Article 2(1) amends article 8 of the 2016 Order to provide for the application of Part 1 protections to wired broadcasts relating to Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, in each case in the manner set out in relevant provisions of that amended article.
These changes implement the United Kingdom’s obligations to provide national treatment of wired broadcasts connected with the UK- Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein FTA countries.

8th April 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Schedule 9 to the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1968). Schedule 9 contains provisions which allow for deductions to be made from benefit and for direct payment to third parties.
Regulation 2 makes amendments to Schedule 9 so that deductions for ongoing liabilities in respect of housing costs under paragraph 3, fuel costs under paragraph 6 and water charges under paragraph 7 may continue to be made whilst the original debt is subject to a moratorium under the Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space Moratorium and Mental Health Crisis Moratorium) (England and Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1311).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

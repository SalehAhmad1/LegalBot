EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Royal Air Force Coningsby, 
Lincolnshire, during an air display that is scheduled to take place there on 23rd July 2021. A large 
number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the display and therefore 
the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be 
restricted in the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
These Regulations also revoke the Air Navigation (Restriction of Flying) (Royal Air Force 
Coningsby) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/575) due to a change in the scheduled date of the Royal 
Air Force Coningsby Families Day event. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(a), the Royal Air Force Coningsby 
Families Day flying display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr S J Maxted, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 383216.

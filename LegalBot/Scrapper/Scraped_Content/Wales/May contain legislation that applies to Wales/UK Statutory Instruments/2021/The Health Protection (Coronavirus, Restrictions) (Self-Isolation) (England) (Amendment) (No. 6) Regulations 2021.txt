Coming into force

The Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 45C(1) and (3)(c), 45D, 45F(2), 45P and 45T(6) of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984(1), makes the following Regulations.
These Regulations are made in response to the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in England.
The Secretary of State considers that the restrictions and requirements imposed by the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020(2) as amended by these Regulations are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.
In accordance with section 45R of that Act, the Secretary of State is of the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make this instrument without a draft having been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.

At 11.55 a.m. on 13th December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020 to remove the distinction between close contacts of a known or suspected Omicron case and close contacts of all other positive cases. All close contacts, regardless of the variant, will no longer be required to self-isolate if they are:
(a)
a person who has received a complete course of the coronavirus vaccination, provided that the contact takes place more than 14 days after they have completed their course of vaccinations;
(b)
a person who is taking part in a vaccine trial,
(c)
a person who can provide evidence that for clinical reasons they should not be vaccinated, or
(d)
a child.
The Regulations also provide that, where a person comes within those categories, but was in a period of self-isolation before 6.00 a.m. on 14th December due to their close contact with a known or suspected positive Omicron case, their period of self-isolation ends at 6.00 a.m. on 14th December.

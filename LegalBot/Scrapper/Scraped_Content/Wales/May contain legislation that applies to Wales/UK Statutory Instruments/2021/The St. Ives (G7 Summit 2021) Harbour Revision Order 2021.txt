Any general directions and special directions made under this Order will also cease to have effect on the G7 termination date. A register of all in force general directions may be inspected during working hours at the harbour office of the Council (Harbour Office, Smeatons Pier, St. Ives, TR26 1LP) and online at www.cornwallharbours.co.uk (article 6 (4)).
The Order creates an offence of failing to comply with special or general directions, the penalty for which is a fine on summary conviction not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale (article 10(1)). A defence of due diligence is available to a person charged under article 10 (article 10(2)).
The Council may also nominate persons (existing sworn police officers) enabling a justice of the peace to appoint them to act as constables within the harbour police area (article 13). This will include the harbour, the additional area and any place within one mile of those areas (article 2). This will apply for all or part of the G7 period. Once appointed, a constable operating within the harbour police area will have all the powers and privileges of a constable.

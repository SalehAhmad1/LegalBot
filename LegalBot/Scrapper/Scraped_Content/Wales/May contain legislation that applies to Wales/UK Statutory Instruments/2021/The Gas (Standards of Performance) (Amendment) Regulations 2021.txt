4th March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Gas (Standards of Performance) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/1135), which impose minimum guaranteed standards of performance in respect of the service provided by gas transporters, and prescribe sums payable to a customer by way of compensation for failure to meet these standards.
The main changes are—
(a)
amending the guaranteed standards of performance by—
(i)
reducing the reinstatement period for priority domestic customers where there is a planned gas supply interruption;
(ii)
including an obligation to provide hot meals and access to hot water during interruptions that last longer than 48 hours where more than 250 customers’ premises are affected together with the payment of a prescribed sum for failure to comply;
(iii)
including an obligation to include diversion and disconnection in the standards on provision of quotations;
(iv)
including an obligation to include disconnection in the standards on responses to land enquiries; and
(v)
decreasing the prescribed periods under which the gas transporter must meet the minimum standards, except under the standard for notice for planned interruptions where the prescribed period is increased;
(b)
removing the requirement for the need for customers to make a claim for compensation to gas transporters;
(c)
removing the cap for payments under the standard for supply restoration following unplanned interruptions;
(d)
increasing the prescribed sums payable if the relevant gas transporter fails to meet the guaranteed standards of performance;
(e)
increasing the prescribed caps applicable to the payment of prescribed sums;
(f)
introducing a mechanism for the prescribed sums to be adjusted in line with consumer prices index including owner occupiers’ housing costs, and then rounded to the nearest £5; and
(g)
introducing a mechanism for the prescribed caps to be adjusted at a rate that is commensurate to any adjustment to the prescribed sums.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (School Performance Information) (England) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/2324) (“the 2007 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the definition of “reporting school year” in regulation 2 of the 2007 Regulations as it applies to an assessment taken in the 2021-22 school year to ascertain the extent to which pupils understand the correspondence between graphemes and phonemes in English. That definition now refers to the school year in which the assessment is taken rather than the school year in which information provided to the Secretary of State is to be published by the Secretary of State.

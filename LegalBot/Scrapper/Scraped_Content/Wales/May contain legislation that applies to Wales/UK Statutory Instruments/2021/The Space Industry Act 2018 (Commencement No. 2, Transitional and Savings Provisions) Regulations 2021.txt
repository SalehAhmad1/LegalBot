(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are the second Commencement Regulations made under the Space Industry Act 2018 (c. 5) (“the Act”) and they bring certain provisions of the Act into force on 29th July 2021. The first set of Commencement Regulations were brought into force by the Space Industry Act 2018 (Commencement No. 1) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1224). The provisions brought into force are mentioned in the Schedule to these Regulations.
The provisions mentioned in the Schedule to these Regulations extend to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland except for those referred to in:
(a)
paragraphs 73, 82 to 85 and 113 which do not extend to Northern Ireland,
(b)
paragraphs 86 to 87 and 116 which apply to Northern Ireland only, and
(c)
paragraph 117 which has the same extent as the amendments to which Schedule 12 to the Act relates.
Regulation 3(1) and (2) makes transitional provisions which enable applications for licences made under the Outer Space Act 1986 (“the 1986 Act”) at the coming into force of the licensing provisions contained in the Act, and which fall to be determined under that Act, to continue to be considered and determined under the 1986 Act.
Regulation 3(3) saves licences granted by virtue of regulation 3(1) and (2) after the coming into force of the licensing provisions made under the Act by treating such licences as granted under the Act.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. Impact Assessments carried out in relation to the Act are available from the Department for Transport, Commercial Spaceflight Team, International Aviation, Safety and Environment, 4th Floor, Great Minster House, 33 Horseferry Road, London SW1P 4DR and at http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/5/pdfs/ukpgaod_20180005_en_001.pdf.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT ORDERS

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend, primarily, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/582) (“the International Travel Regulations”). The amendments introduce lateral flow device (“LFD”) tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 as an alternative to existing requirements on arrivals deemed to be “eligible travellers” to undertake day 2 polymerase chain reaction tests.
Regulations 4, 5 and 10 amend regulations 3J and 3K of, and Schedule 8 to, the International Travel Regulations to provide for the use of LFD tests, and the consequences of the results of those tests.
Regulation 6 and 7 amend regulations 18A and 18B of the International Travel Regulations to impose requirements on test providers and on others providing testing services in relation to LFD testing.
Regulations 8 and 12 amend regulation 19 of, and Schedule 14 to, the International Travel Regulations to provide for updated offences and fixed monetary penalties in connection with the LFD test obligations.
These Regulations make further minor and consequential amendments to the International Travel Regulations.
Regulation 13 amends the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/659) (“the Notification Regulations”) to insert new regulation 4B, which imposes an obligation to notify the United Kingdom Health Security Agency of certain information in relation to LFD tests. Regulation 13 makes further minor and consequential amendments to the Notification Regulations.

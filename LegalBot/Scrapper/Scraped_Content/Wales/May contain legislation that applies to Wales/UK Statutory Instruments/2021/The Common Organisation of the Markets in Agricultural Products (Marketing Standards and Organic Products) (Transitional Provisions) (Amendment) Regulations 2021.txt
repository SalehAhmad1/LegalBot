(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 89(a) and 227(4) of retained Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 (EUR 2013/1308) and sections 38(5)(a) and 50(3) of the Agriculture Act 2020 (c.21).

These Regulations amend the transitional provisions in the retained EU legislation and subordinate legislation by extending the current transitional arrangements concerning the requirements that apply to imported products to align with the revised timetable for the introduction of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) border controls.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

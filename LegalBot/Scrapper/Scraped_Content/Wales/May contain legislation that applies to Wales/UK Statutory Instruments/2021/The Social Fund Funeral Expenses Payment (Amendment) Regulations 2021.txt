(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies, in particular deficiencies under paragraphs (c) to (ea) of section 8(2) and paragraph (a) of section 8(3) of that Act, arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to domestic legislation, specifically the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/3061) (the “Social Fund Regulations”), to reflect that the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State of the European Union. This is so that persons who fall within regulation 7(10) of the Social Fund Regulations continue to satisfy the condition in regulation 7(9) of those Regulations if they hold the funeral in the United Kingdom.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

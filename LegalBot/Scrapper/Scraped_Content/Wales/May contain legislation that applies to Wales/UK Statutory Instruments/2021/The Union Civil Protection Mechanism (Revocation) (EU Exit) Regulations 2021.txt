(This note is not part of the Order)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to remedy deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. In particular, these Regulations remedy deficiencies under sections 8(2)(a) and (b) of the Act, by revoking legislation which is redundant or confers functions on, or in relation to, EU entities.
Regulation 2 revokes various pieces of retained direct EU legislation relating to the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, of which the UK is no longer a member, and EU action in the field of civil protection in which the UK no longer participates on the basis of such membership.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

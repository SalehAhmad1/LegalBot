1975 c. 23. The 1975 Act was repealed in relation to Scotland by the Reservoirs (Scotland) Act 2011 (asp 9). Functions under the 1975 Act, in so far as exercisable in relation to Wales, were transferred to the National Assembly for Wales by S.I. 1999/672, and further transferred to Welsh Ministers by paragraph 30 of Schedule 11 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32). References to the National Assembly for Wales now have effect as a reference to Senedd Cymru, by virtue of section 150A(2) of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32). The 1975 Act was amended by the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (c. 29) which added section 4(10), 4(11) and 5(2). Sections 4 and 5 (as amended) enable the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers to establish panels jointly and to exercise functions in relation to those panels jointly.Citation and commencement

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations prescribe the manner in which a civil engineer may apply to be appointed or reappointed to a joint panel of civil engineers set up for the purposes of the Reservoirs Act 1975, and the fee to accompany such an application. These Regulations relate to application for membership of four joint panels established as a result of a joint determination by the Secretary of State and Welsh Ministers in 2021.
Regulation 3 requires an application to be made in writing to the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers, accompanied by the information set out in Schedule 1 and the prescribed fee. For applications made between 1st January 2022 and 31st March 2022 the application fee is £385. From 1st April 2022 the fee will be £450. In the case of a first appointment to a joint panel a reference from a qualified civil engineer as to suitability is also required. A reference is not required where an applicant is already a member of a joint panel and the applicant is seeking reappointment, nor where an applicant is already a member of the corresponding existing panel to the joint panel to which they are applying and the application is made before that appointment ends.
Appointments to the joint panels will be made jointly by the Secretary of State and the Welsh Ministers following assessment and recommendations from the Reservoirs Committee of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
Regulation 4 revokes the Reservoirs (Panels of Civil Engineers) (Application and Fees) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992/1527) and the Reservoirs (Panels of Civil Engineers) (Application and Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/143). This means that from 1st January 2022 no further applications can be accepted to existing panels.
Regulation 4 also includes transitional provisions that allow an applicant who has applied for appointment or reappointment to an existing panel before 1st January 2022, but appointment or reappointment has not yet taken place, to be appointed to the corresponding joint panel, with that applicant’s consent.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

20th October 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 (“the Phytosanitary Conditions Regulation”) establishing uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and the Council, as regards protective measures against pests of plants.
Regulation 2 amends the Phytosanitary Conditions Regulation to include additional measures to prevent the introduction of the plant pests Prodiplosis longifila, Agrilus fleischeri, Thekopsora minima and Agrilus planipennis in Great Britain. It deregulates the following pests which do not pose a risk to biosecurity in Great Britain: Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. Savastanoi, Epidiaspis leperii, Heterodera fici, Apricot latent virus and Aucuba mosaic agent and blackcurrant yellows agent combined. It also introduces a prohibition, pending a risk assessment, on the introduction of Polymnia sonchifolia, which risks introducing a GB quarantine pest of potatoes.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

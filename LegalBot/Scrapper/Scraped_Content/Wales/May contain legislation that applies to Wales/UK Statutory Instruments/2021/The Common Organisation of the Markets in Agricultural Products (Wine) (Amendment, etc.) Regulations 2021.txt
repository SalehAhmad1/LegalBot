9th March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(b) and (e)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends Article 107 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 (EUR 2013/1308) in order to correct an error in the Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products (Producer Organisations and Wine) (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1446).
Article 107 was amended by regulation 7 of the Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products and Common Agricultural Policy (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/828), which was subsequently amended by regulation 6(3) of the Common Organisation of the Markets in Agricultural Products (Miscellaneous Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1452). However, regulation 7 of S.I. 2019/828 was omitted in error by regulation 7(4) of S.I. 2020/1446, meaning that the amendments to Article 107 did not come into effect on IP completion day as intended. Regulation 2 makes equivalent amendments to Article 107 to those intended to come into force on IP completion day.
Regulation 3 revokes regulation 6(3) of S.I. 2020/1452 which was rendered ineffective by regulation 7(4) of S.I. 2020/1446.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Fines (Deductions from Income Support) Regulations 1992 (S.I. 1992/2182) (“the Fines Regulations”) and the Universal Credit, Personal Independence Payment, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance (Claims and Payments) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/380) (“the Claims and Payments Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends regulation 4 of the Fines Regulations so that deductions from universal credit to pay for court fines are made at a flat rate of 5% of the appropriate universal credit standard allowance.
Regulation 3 amends paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 6 to the Claims and Payments Regulations which lists the deductions priority order. This amendment is necessary to align the deductions priority order list with the rate for court fine deductions provided for in regulation 2 of these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These are the first commencement regulations made under the Air Traffic Management and Unmanned Aircraft Act 2021 (c. 12) (“the Act”). They bring Parts 2 and 3 of the Act into force on 29th June 2021, insofar as they are not brought into force by section 21 of the Act.
Part 2 of the Act concerns air traffic. Regulation 2 brings sections 9 to 11 and Schedules 3 to 7 into force on 29th June 2021. These provisions update the regulatory framework governing the provision of en route air traffic services. Section 12 (which concerns airport slot allocation) came into force upon Royal Assent on 29th April 2021 (see section 21 of the Act).
Part 3 of the Act makes provision in relation to police enforcement powers to tackle unlawful use of unmanned aircraft. Section 21(1) of the Act brought some provisions of Part 3 into force upon Royal Assent on 29th April 2021, in some cases only for the purpose of making regulations, and section 21(2) brings section 14 and Schedule 9 into force for all other purposes on 29th June 2021. Regulation 2 brings the remaining provisions of Part 3 into force for all other purposes on 29th June 2021.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, in order to address failures of retained European Union (EU) law to operate effectively and other deficiencies, in particular under sub-paragraphs (a), (d) and (e) of section 8(2) of that Act, arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the EU.
Regulation 2 makes provision to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively as a result of the fact that the UK is no longer a member of the Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools.
These Regulations revoke the Orders in Council listed in the Schedule, which were made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and relate to European Schools.
A full Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

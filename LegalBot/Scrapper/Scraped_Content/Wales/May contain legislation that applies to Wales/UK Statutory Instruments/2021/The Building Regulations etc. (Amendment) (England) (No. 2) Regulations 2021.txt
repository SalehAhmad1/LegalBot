Department for Levelling Up, Housing and CommunitiesEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Building Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2214) as they apply in relation to England to require the installation of electric vehicle charge points or cable routes for electric vehicle charge points when certain kinds of building work are undertaken. These Regulations also amend the Building (Approved Inspectors etc.) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2215) as they apply in relation to England.
Regulation 2(3) inserts a new Part 9B into the Building Regulations 2010. It makes provision in relation to the operation of a new Part S (inserted by regulation 2(5) of these Regulations) of Schedule 1 (new regulations 44D to 44I). New regulation 44J provides for the minimum standards of an electric vehicle charge point. New regulation 44K provides for the interpretation of Part 9B of, and Part S of Schedule 1 to, the Building Regulations 2010.
Regulation 2(4) adds a new regulation 56 to the Building Regulations 2010 to make provision for the review of Part 9B of, and Part S of Schedule 1 to, those Regulations.
Regulation 2(5) inserts a new Part S into Schedule 1 (requirements) to the Building Regulations 2010 to require electric vehicle charge points or cabling for electric vehicle charge points to be installed in new residential buildings or buildings other than dwellings, certain buildings undergoing a material change of use, or certain residential buildings or buildings other than dwellings undergoing major renovation.

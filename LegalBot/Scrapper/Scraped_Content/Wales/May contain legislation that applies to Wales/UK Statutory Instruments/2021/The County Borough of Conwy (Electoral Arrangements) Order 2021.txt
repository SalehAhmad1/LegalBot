(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the recommendations of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”), which reported in May 2019 on its review of the electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Conwy. The Commission’s Report proposed a reduction in the number of electoral wards from 38 to 30, and a reduction in the number of councillors from 59 to 55.
This Order implements the Commission’s recommendations, with modifications.
Article 3 of this Order abolishes the existing electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Conwy and introduces the Schedule, which sets out the new electoral arrangements for the County Borough of Conwy.
Article 4 implements the recommendation for a change to community boundaries within the County Borough of Conwy and provides for the transfer of an area from the community of Colwyn Bay to the community of Rhos-on-Sea.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.
Prints of the map to which this Order relates are deposited in the office of the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ (Local Government Democracy Division), and with Conwy County Borough Council.

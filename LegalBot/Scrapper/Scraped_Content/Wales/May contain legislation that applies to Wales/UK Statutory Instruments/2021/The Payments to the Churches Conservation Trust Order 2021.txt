(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides that, in respect of the period from 1st April 2021 to 31st March 2024, the total amount to be paid by the Church Commissioners to the Churches Conservation Trust is a fixed sum of £4,500,000 plus certain additional sums determined in the way described below. The total amount consists of grants made by the Church Commissioners and moneys allocated by them out of the net proceeds of the sale or exchange of churches closed for regular public worship or land occupied by them and the net premiums for the grant of leases of such churches or land.
The additional sums referred to above are determined as follows. If the Commissioners’ share of the net proceeds and premiums referred to above exceeds £650,000 in 2021, 2022 or 2023, the amount of the excess is payable to the Trust. But that is subject to an overall cap of £900,000 on the additional payments for the whole of the three-year period.
The Order also provides for payments on account if the amount in question is a proportion of a sum needed by the Trust and if Parliament has approved the payment of the balance of that sum.

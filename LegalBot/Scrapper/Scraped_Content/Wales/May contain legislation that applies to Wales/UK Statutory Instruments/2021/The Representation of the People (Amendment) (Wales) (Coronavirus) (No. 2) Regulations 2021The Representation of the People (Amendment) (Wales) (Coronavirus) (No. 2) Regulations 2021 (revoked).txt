(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in relation to proxy voting at certain local government by-elections.
Regulation 2 amends the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, so as to extend the additional grounds for applicants applying for emergency proxy votes, or changing their nominated proxy, implemented by the Representation of the People (Amendment) (Wales) (Coronavirus) Regulations 2021. These additional grounds relate to persons who are unable to attend a polling station in person as a result of following relevant legislation, guidance or medical advice in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Welsh Ministersâ€™ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

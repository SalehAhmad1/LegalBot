(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings together the tuberculosis control regimes applicable to bovine animals, goats, sheep, pigs, camelids and deer.
Article 2(1) (amongst other things) and Schedule 1 provide for the definition of the low-risk area. Article 4 extends the definition of “disease” in the Animal Health Act 1981 (c. 22) to include tuberculosis.
Part 2 applies in relation to all animals listed above. Articles 5 and 6 provide for the giving of notice where specified individuals know or suspect tuberculosis is present in an animal or a carcase. Article 7 provides that, where a veterinary inspector believes that an animal or carcase is infected with tuberculosis, that veterinary inspector must carry out an inquiry as to the existence of tuberculosis. In order to carry out that inquiry, the veterinary inspector may examine any animal or carcase, carry out tests, and mark any animal or carcase.
Part 2 also contains provisions relating to the testing of animals suspected to have tuberculosis (and the consequences if tuberculosis cannot be ruled out), notification of intended slaughter of infected animals, precautions against the spread of infection, suspected animals in markets or shows, control of infection from other animals, the identification and movement of deer, and other matters.
Part 3 only applies in relation to bovine animals. Articles 19 (and Schedule 2) and 20 set out provisions for pre- and post- movement testing respectively. Articles 21 and 22 provide for exempt markets and exempt and approved finishing units and approved collecting centres. Article 23 provides for the publication of information about bovine herds that have, or have lost, officially tuberculosis-free status.
Part 4 contains general provisions concerning notices, licences and approvals and enforcement.
Part 5 contains provisions concerning revocation, a consequential amendment, transitional provisions and review.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no new significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

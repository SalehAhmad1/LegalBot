They make amendments to the Customs Tariff (Preferential Trade Arrangements) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1457) to implement preferential customs import duty rates agreed under further free trade arrangements entered into between Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the governments of other countries or territories. They also amend the Customs (Tariff Quotas) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1432).
Regulation 2 amends S.I. 2020/1432. The definition of “Quota Table” in regulation 2 is amended to refer to an updated version of that.

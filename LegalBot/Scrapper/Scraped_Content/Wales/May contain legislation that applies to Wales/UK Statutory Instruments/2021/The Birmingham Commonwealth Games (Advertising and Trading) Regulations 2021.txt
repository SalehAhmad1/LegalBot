Section 16(2) of the 2020 Act provides that a person carries out “Games location trading” if the person carries out trading in a specified Games location at any time during a specified period, or trading in a relevant public place in the vicinity of a Games location at any time during a specified period.
These Regulations specify Games locations and periods for the purposes of section 13 and section 16. They also make provision as to when a person is to be treated (for the purposes of section 13 and section 16) as advertising or trading in, or in the vicinity of, a Games location.
These Regulations also make provision to specify the conduct to which section 13(1) (the advertising offence) and section 16(1) (the trading offence) does not apply.
Regulation 3 and Schedule 1 set out the specified Games locations for the purposes of section 13 and section 16.

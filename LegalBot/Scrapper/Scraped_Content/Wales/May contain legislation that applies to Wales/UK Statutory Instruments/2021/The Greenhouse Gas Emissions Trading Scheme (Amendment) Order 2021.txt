Specific provisions for biofuels
1.  For mixed fuels, the aircraft operator may either assume the absence of biomass and apply a default fossil fraction of 100% or determine a biomass fraction in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3.
2.  Where biofuels are physically mixed with fossil fuels and delivered to an aircraft in physically identifiable batches, the aircraft operator may carry out analyses in accordance with Articles 32 to 35 to determine the biomass fraction on the basis of a relevant standard and the analytical methods set out in those Articles, provided that the use of that standard and those analytical methods is approved by the regulator. Where the aircraft operator provides evidence to the satisfaction of the regulator that such analyses would incur unreasonable costs or are technically not feasible, the aircraft operator may base an estimation of the biomass fraction on a mass balance of fossil fuels and biofuels purchased.
3.  Where purchased biofuel batches are not physically delivered to a specific aircraft, the aircraft operator shall not use analyses to determine the biomass fraction of the fuels used. In such a case, the aircraft operator may determine the biomass fraction using purchase records of biofuel of equivalent energy content, provided that the aircraft operator provides evidence to the satisfaction of the regulator that there is no double counting of the same biofuel quantity, in particular that the biofuel purchased is not claimed to be used by anyone else.
4.  Where a biofuel meets the sustainability criteria referred to in the Schedule to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007(1), the emission factor of the biofuel shall be zero; and for the purpose of determining whether the sustainability criteria are met, the biofuel (wherever supplied) must be treated as supplied in the United Kingdom.

“Capacity increases: application to increase emissions targets
19A.—(1) Where a capacity increase is put into operation at an installation after the reference date, the operator of the installation may apply to the regulator to increase the installation’s emissions targets for scheme years after the capacity increase is put into operation (including, if the capacity increase is put into operation on or after 1st January 2021, for the scheme year in which the capacity increase is put into operation).
(2) An application may be made to increase emissions targets for scheme years in the 2021-2025 allocation period or the 2026-2030 allocation period (or both).
(3) But an application may not be made to increase an emissions target—
(a)
for the 2021 or 2022 scheme year if the emissions target for that year was calculated under paragraph 16(4)(a) or (5)(a) or (b);
(b)
for the 2026 or 2027 scheme year if the emissions target for that year was calculated under paragraph 17(4)(a) or (5)(a) or (b).
(4) Nor may an application be made to increase an emissions target—
(a)
for the 2021 scheme year unless the application is made on or before 31st March 2022;
(b)
for any other scheme year unless the application is made on or before the later of—
(i)
the end of the scheme year; and
(ii)
where the capacity increase is put into operation in the scheme year, 3 months after the date on which the capacity increase is put into operation.
(5) Subject to sub-paragraph (4), an application to increase emissions targets may be made at any time.
Capacity increases: content of application
19B.—(1) For the purpose of an application to increase an installation’s emissions targets, the operator must divide the installation into sub-installations in accordance with Article 10 of the Free Allocation Regulation.
(2) The application must contain the following—
(a)
evidence of the capacity increase and the sub-installation to which it relates, including evidence that it has been put into operation and is not temporary;
(b)
evidence of any capacity decrease at the installation since the reference date and the sub-installation to which it relates, including, where relevant, evidence that it is temporary;
(c)
evidence to enable the combined capacity utilisation factor to be calculated (see paragraph 19F);
(d)
where the capacity increase or any capacity decrease relates to a district heating sub-installation or a heat benchmark sub-installation of an installation that consumes or exports measurable heat produced outside the installation, evidence of whether or not the capacity increase or capacity decrease is solely associated with measurable heat produced at the installation.
Capacity increases: grant of application
19C.—(1) An application to increase an installation’s emissions targets may be granted only if the regulator considers that—
(a)
a capacity increase has been put into operation at the installation;
(b)
the capacity increase is not temporary; and
(c)
the net change in installed capacity at the installation since the reference date (see paragraph 19D) is greater than zero.
(2) Where the application is granted, the regulator must—
(a)
calculate new emissions targets for each scheme year for which the application is made by increasing the existing emissions target for the scheme year by the increase in the emissions target for the scheme year (see paragraph 19E); and
(b)
vary the installation’s hospital or small emitter permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 by substituting the new emissions targets for the existing targets.
(3) Except where the installation is a hospital-qualifying installation, if increasing the emissions target for a scheme year would result in an emissions target that exceeds the maximum amount, the emissions target must be increased by such amount as results in an emissions target of the maximum amount.
(4) Where, after calculating new emissions targets and varying the permit under sub-paragraph (2), the regulator considers that, as a result of incorrect or incomplete evidence in the application, either the application would not have been granted or the installation’s emissions targets would not have been increased to the same extent—
(a)
the regulator may, for the current and future scheme years, determine that the emissions targets should not have been increased or, as the case may be, recalculate the new emissions targets under sub-paragraph (2)(a); and
(b)
if the regulator does either of the things referred to in paragraph (a), the regulator must vary the permit under paragraph 6 of Schedule 6 accordingly.
Capacity increases: net change in installed capacity at installation since reference date
19D.—(1) The net change in installed capacity at the installation since the reference date must be calculated as follows.
Step 1
Calculate the following for each relevant sub-installation—
the net change in installed capacity at the relevant sub-installation since the reference date x the benchmark for the sub-installation.
Step 2
Add up all calculations done under Step 1.
The net change in installed capacity at the installation since the reference date is the result of Step 2.
(2) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)—
(a)
the net change in installed capacity at a relevant sub-installation must be determined by taking into account only capacity increases and capacity decreases (other than capacity decreases that are temporary) that relate to the sub-installation since the reference date;
(b)
where capacity decreases exceed capacity increases at a sub-installation, the net change in installed capacity must be a negative value;
(c)
in calculating the net change in installed capacity at a district heating sub-installation or a heat benchmark sub-installation of an installation that consumes or exports measurable heat produced outside the installation, any capacity increase or capacity decrease that relates to the sub-installation must not be taken into account unless it is solely associated with measurable heat produced at the installation.
(3) In this paragraph, “relevant sub-installation” means—
(a)
the sub-installation to which the capacity increase relates;
(b)
any other sub-installation to which a capacity decrease at the installation since the reference date relates.
Capacity increases: increase in emissions targets for scheme years
19E.—(1) The increase in an installation’s emissions target for each scheme year for which the application is made is NC x CCUF x RF x FYF, where—
NC is the net change in installed capacity at the installation since the reference date (see paragraph 19D);
CCUF is the combined capacity utilisation factor (see paragraph 19F);
RF is the reduction factor for the scheme year;
FYF is the first year factor.
(2) The reduction factor—
(a)
for a scheme year set out in column 1 of table D in paragraph 16 is the value set out in the corresponding entry in column 2;
(b)
for a scheme year set out in column 1 of table E in paragraph 17 is the value set out in the corresponding entry in column 2.
(3) The first year factor is—
(a)
for the scheme year in which the capacity increase is put into operation, (Y-D)/Y;
(b)
for any other scheme year, 1.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
Y is the number of days in the scheme year;
(b)
D is the number of days in the scheme year before the date on which the capacity increase is put into operation.
(5) Where an application is made in respect of two or more capacity increases, for the purpose of calculating the first year factor, the capacity increases must be treated as being put into operation on the date on which the last capacity increase is put into operation.
Capacity increases: combined capacity utilisation factor
19F.—(1) The combined capacity utilisation factor must be calculated as follows.
Step 1
Calculate the following for each sub-installation to which the capacity increase relates—
the capacity increase x the benchmark for the sub-installation x the capacity utilisation factor.
Step 2
Add up all calculations done under Step 1.
Step 3
Calculate the following for each sub-installation to which the capacity increase relates—
the capacity increase x the benchmark for the sub-installation.
Step 4
Add up all calculations done under Step 3.
Step 5
Divide the result of Step 2 by the result of Step 4.
The combined capacity utilisation factor is the result of Step 5.
(2) In calculating the combined capacity utilisation factor, a capacity increase that relates to a district heating sub-installation or a heat benchmark sub-installation of an installation that consumes or exports measurable heat produced outside the installation must not be taken into account unless it is solely associated with measurable heat produced at the installation.
(3) Where an application is made in respect of two or more capacity increases that relate to the same sub-installation, for the purpose of calculating the combined capacity utilisation factor, the calculations under Steps 1 and 3 must be done separately for each such capacity increase as if the capacity increases related to separate sub-installations.
(4) In this paragraph, “capacity utilisation factor”, in relation to a capacity increase, means the expected level of production or consumption, expressed as a proportion of the increase in installed capacity.
Capacity increases: interpretation

Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (the “UK ETS”) was established by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 (the “UK ETS Order”). The UK ETS runs for ten “scheme years” beginning in 2021. Operators of certain industrial installations and certain aircraft operators are required to monitor, report on, and surrender “allowances” equivalent to, their greenhouse gas emissions in each scheme year. Some operators and aircraft operators receive an allocation of allowances free of charge, details of which are published in allocation tables. Allowances are held in accounts in the UK ETS registry, and there is a cap on the number of allowances that may be created. For installations that meet the eligibility criteria, there are two opt-out schemes, one for “hospital or small emitters”, the other for “ultra-small emitters”. Such installations are not required to surrender allowances.
This Order amends the UK ETS Order and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 (the “Free Allocation Regulation”). Article 24 of the UK ETS Order provides that Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 (the “Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018”) has effect for the purposes of the UK ETS, with modifications, and this Order makes further modifications. The main changes made by this Order are as follows.
Installations
Provision is made for the regulator to reject an installation’s monitoring plan and for the operator to appeal against the decision (see amendments to articles 70 and 72 and substituted paragraph 8 of Schedule 4, which modifies Article 12 of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018). The regulator may refuse to issue a permit unless a monitoring plan has been approved under that Regulation or to convert a hospital or small emitter permit into a greenhouse gas emissions permit unless the monitoring plan complies with that Regulation (see substituted paragraph 3 of Schedule 6, substituted paragraph 9 of Schedule 7 and amendments to paragraphs 24 and 26 of Schedule 7).
When an application is made for an installation’s permit to be transferred from one operator to another, the regulator must approve the new operator’s monitoring plan and any monitoring methodology plan required for free allocation purposes, or any variations of the existing plans, before granting the application (see amendments to paragraphs 8 and 9 of Schedule 6). Where some units of an installation are transferred to an operator of an installation on the same site as the transferred units, the regulator may vary the operator’s existing permit to include the transferred units instead of issuing a new permit (see amendments to paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 of Schedule 6).
A number of technical amendments are made to align more closely the monitoring and reporting rules for process emissions from all forms of carbon (see substituted paragraph 36, and amendments to paragraph 38, of Schedule 4, which modify Annexes 2 and 4 of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018).
Hospital or small emitters and ultra-small emitters
Hospital or small emitters may apply to increase their emissions targets if the capacity of an installation is increased (see new paragraphs 19A to 19G of Schedule 7). It is made clear that, where a verifier is used to verify the reportable emissions of a hospital or small emitter, the operator is exempt from the requirement in Article 69(4) of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018 to submit a report if the verifier either finds outstanding non-conformities or makes recommendations for improvements (see amendments to paragraph 13 of Schedule 7 (which modifies Article 47(3) of the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018 as it applies to such installations)).
Hospital or small emitters and ultra-small emitters that cease to be eligible for the relevant opt-out scheme and join the main scheme may claim a free allocation of allowances if a successful application for free allocation was previously made (see amendments to articles 4A, 34B, 34C and 34G and paragraph 4 of Schedule 6, new article 34HA and new Schedule 8A). The amount of the civil penalty that may be imposed on operators of such installations who fail to comply with the requirements to notify that they are no longer eligible is reduced to take into account of free allocation (see amendments to articles 57 and 60).
Aviation
A person who is not an “aircraft operator” may apply for an emissions monitoring plan (see amendments to articles 28, 29 and 30). The UK ETS Order contained an error in the methodology for calculating the “aviation free allocation entitlement” of certain applicants. The error is corrected, and provision is made for the entitlement of those applicants to be recalculated (see article 29 of this Order and the amendments to articles 34J and 34N of the UK ETS Order).
It is made clear that, if a biofuel meets the “sustainability criteria” under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007, the “emission factor” is zero. Provision is made for the biomass fraction of mixed fuels to be determined by using purchase records (see amendment to article 4 and substituted paragraph 27 of Schedule 4 (which further modifies the Monitoring and Reporting Regulation 2018, including by substituting Article 54)).
Registry
Reportable emissions of installations and aviation emissions of aircraft operators must be recorded in the registry (see new paragraph 6A of Schedule 5A). An exemption from liability in damages is expressly provided to those exercising registry functions (see new paragraph 8A of Schedule 5A). Errors made when allocating allowances free of charge may be reversed (see new paragraph 22(6) of Schedule 5A). Account holders may apply for an account to be suspended (see amendments to paragraph 25 of Schedule 5A).
Miscellaneous
It is made clear that the process for correcting errors in allocation tables applies even if the error is a failure to include an installation or an aircraft operator in the table (see amendments to articles 34H and 34R).

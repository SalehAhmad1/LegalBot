Regulation 6(2)(e) removes a redundant definition.
Regulation 7 makes transitional and saving provision as follows—
Paragraph (1) saves provisions in regulations 1 and 12 of the principal Regulations as they had effect before these Regulations came into force in relation to a capital receipt received before 1st April 2021 and for the purpose of determining the value of F for the quarters during the period 1st April 2012 to 31st March 2013 (see paragraph 4 of the Schedule);
Paragraph (2) modifies regulation 13 of the principal Regulations to make transitional provision in relation to the payment of interest on any unpaid amount payable before 31st July 2021;

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (d) and (g)), in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. These Regulations are also made in exercise of the powers in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c. 68) for reasons unconnected to the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
The Equine Identification (England) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/761) (“the Equine ID Regulations”) supplement and make provision for the enforcement of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/262 laying down rules pursuant to Council Directives 90/427/EEC and 2009/156/EC as regards the methods for the identification of equidae (OJ No L 59, 3.3.2015, p1) in England. Regulation 2 amends the Equine ID Regulations to correct errors unconnected to the UK's exit from the European Union. Regulation 3 addresses failures to operate effectively and other deficiencies in those Regulations arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public sector is foreseen.

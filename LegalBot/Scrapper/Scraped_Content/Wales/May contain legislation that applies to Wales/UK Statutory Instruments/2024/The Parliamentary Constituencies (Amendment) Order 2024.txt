S.I. 2023/1230.Richard Tilbrook
Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order corrects an error in the Parliamentary Constituencies Order 2023 (S.I. 2023/1230). In that Order the part of the Castlecaulfield ward to the south of the northern boundary of the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency (as described in the Parliamentary Constituencies (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/1486)) was incorrectly described as forming part of the Mid Ulster constituency. This Order amends that description to refer to the part of the ward north of that boundary, to give proper effect to the recommendations of the report of the Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland published 28th June 2023.
By virtue of section 4(6) of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 (c. 50), the coming into force of this Order does not affect any parliamentary election until a proclamation is issued by His Majesty summoning a new Parliament or affect the constitution of the House of Commons until the dissolution of the Parliament then in being.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

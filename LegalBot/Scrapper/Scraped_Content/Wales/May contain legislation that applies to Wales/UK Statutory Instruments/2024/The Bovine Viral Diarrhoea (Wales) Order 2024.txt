has an individual BVD status of negative under paragraph (4)(a).Restrictions on the movement of animals where sampling obligations are not met
42.—(1) This article applies to the keeper of a bovine herd or bovine animal if, by the date of the most recent compliance deadline (set in accordance with article 26), the keeper has failed to comply with any of their obligations in articles 25, 29 or 32 (in this article “the applicable obligations”).
(2) Where paragraph (1) applies, the herd has a collective BVD status of not negative.
(3) The keeper must not, during the relevant period, move (or arrange to move) any bovine animal from the holding on which it is kept unless—
(a)
the animal is being moved to slaughter,
(b)
the movement is under a licence granted by a veterinary inspector or the Welsh Ministers, or
(c)
an approved veterinary surgeon reasonably considers that further action or investigation has been carried out which confirms that BVDV is not or is no longer present in the animal and has by notice informed the keeper and the Welsh Ministers of that fact.
(4) In paragraph (3), “the relevant period” is the period—
(a)
beginning with the date of the most recent compliance deadline, and
(b)
ending on the date on which the keeper has—
(i)
complied with all of the applicable obligations, and
(ii)
received a notification in respect of the samples tested in accordance with those obligations.Isolation of bovine animals which are persistently infected
43.—(1) This article applies to a bovine herd which contains one or more bovine animals with an individual BVD status of persistently infected in accordance with article 34(b).
(2) Subject to paragraph (4), the keeper must separate all the bovine animals with an individual BVD status of persistently infected from the rest of the herd and house them in one or more groups (each a “BVD PI group”) in accordance with the conditions in paragraph (3).
(3) The conditions of this paragraph are—
(a)
that the keeper must not move the animals off the holding, and
(b)
that the animals are housed indoors and in a manner consistent with good practice which—
(i)
prevents physical contact with, and
(ii)
does not give rise to any appreciable risk of transferring BVDV to,
any bovine animal that is not part of a BVD PI group.
(4) Paragraph (2) does not apply where the animal is being—
(a)
moved to slaughter,
(b)
moved to a place for veterinary treatment, provided that the animal is returned direct to its premises of origin after the treatment, is killed or goes direct to slaughter, or
(c)
moved under a licence granted by a veterinary inspector or the Welsh Ministers.
(5) A bovine animal does not cease to be part of a bovine herd by virtue of its separation under this article.Meaning of “moved to slaughter”
44.—(1) In this Part, where any bovine animal is “moved to slaughter” this means that the animal is being moved under the conditions specified in paragraph (2).
(2) The conditions are that the animal is being moved—
(a)
directly to slaughter, and
(b)
under arrangements which do not give rise to any appreciable risk of infection with BVDV to any other bovine animal (except a bovine animal which is also being moved to slaughter).Enforcement
45.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), this Order is enforced by the local authority.
(2) The Welsh Ministers may direct, in relation to any particular case or class of case, that they will enforce this Order instead of the local authority.Powers of entry

there are reasonable grounds to enter those premises for the purposes of enforcing this Order, and
(b)
any of the conditions in paragraph (3) are met.
(3) The conditions are—
(a)
entry to the premises has been, or is likely to be, refused, and notice of intention to apply for a warrant has been given to the occupier,
(b)
asking for admission to the premises, or giving such notice, would defeat the object of entry,
(c)
entry is required urgently, or
(d)
the premises are unoccupied or the occupier is temporarily absent.
(4) A warrant may be granted for a period of up to 3 months.
(5) An inspector entering premises which are unoccupied or from which the occupier is temporarily absent must leave the premises as effectively secured against unauthorised entry as they were before entry.Powers of inspectors

(a)
inspect any animal or article there;
(b)
take samples;
(c)
carry out any inquiries, examinations or tests;

inspect and check the operation of, and data on, any computer and any associated apparatus or material that is or has been in use in connection with the records.
(2) Where an inspector has entered premises and it is not reasonably practicable to determine whether documents or records on those premises are relevant, the inspector may seize them to ascertain whether they are relevant or not.
(3) The inspector may—
(a)
take any necessary equipment or vehicle on to the premises;
(b)
be accompanied by such other persons as the inspector considers necessary.Offences by bodies corporate
48.—(1) If an offence against the Act is committed by a body corporate, and is shown to have been committed with the consent or connivance of an officer, or to be attributable to the neglect of such officer, that officer as well as the body corporate is guilty of the offence and liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly.
(2) If the affairs of a body corporate are managed by its members, paragraph (1) applies in relation to the acts and defaults of a member in connection with functions of management as if that person were a director of the body.

11 June 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides for the control and eradication of Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (“BVD”) in Wales.
Part 1 of this Order contains general provisions. Article 3 extends the definition of disease under section 88(1) of the Animal Health Act 1981 (c. 22) to BVD.
Part 2 of this Order provides for the approval of veterinary surgeons and laboratories to carry out functions under the Order.
Part 3 of this Order provides for the sampling and notification procedures to be followed. The types of samples listed in article 11 may only be taken by, or under the supervision of, an approved veterinary surgeon. Samples must be submitted for testing under the conditions in article 12. Article 13 provides for the conditions applicable where an ear tag sample of tissue is taken from a bovine animal. Articles 14 and 15 apply where a management tag has been applied to an animal. Article 16 specifies the notification requirements of test results by operators of approved laboratories. Article 17 requires keepers to notify others of the BVD status of a bovine animal in certain circumstances.
Part 4 of this Order provides for the BVD status of individual bovine animals (article 19) and herds (article 20). An approved veterinary surgeon may change the individual status of an animal (article 21) or the collective status of a herd (article 22), and must notify such a change to the keeper and the Welsh Ministers (article 23).
Part 5 of this Order provides for the screening of bovine herds and individual animals to determine the presence of BVD. A keeper must arrange for the sampling of a herd for BVD in accordance with articles 25 and 26. Subject to the test results of this sample (articles 27 and 28), further testing of individual animals, including calves, must be carried out (articles 29 to 37).
Part 6 of this Order provides for movement restrictions for bovine herds with a collective BVD status of not negative (article 38), for animals with an individual BVD status of positive (article 39), or where sampling and testing obligations have not been met (article 42). Article 40 specifies the pre-movement testing procedure for animals in a herd which has a collective BVD status of not negative, and article 41 provides for post-movement testing of animals from outside of Wales which are moved onto a holding in Wales. Article 43 provides for the separation of animals with an individual BVD status of persistently infected from the rest of the herd.
Part 7 of this Order contains enforcement provisions. Articles 45, 46 and 47 provide for enforcement, powers of entry and powers of inspectors. Article 48 provides for offences by bodies corporate.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

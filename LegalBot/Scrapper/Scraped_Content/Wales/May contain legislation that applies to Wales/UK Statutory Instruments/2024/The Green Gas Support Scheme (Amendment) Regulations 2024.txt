at 12.40 p.m. on 14th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in Great Britain, amend the Green Gas Support Scheme Regulations 2021 S.I. 2021/1335 (“the 2021 Regulations”), which established the Green Gas Support Scheme (“the GGSS”). The GGSS is a renewable heat incentive scheme to facilitate and encourage the production of biomethane by anaerobic digestion, for injection into the gas grid. These Regulations make amendments to extend the scheme, providing for a new scheme closure date of 31 March 2028.
Amendments are also made to provide that heat supplied by certain eligible heat pumps is exempt from deductions to eligible biomethane to provide biomethane producers with an incentive to use heat pumps in the production of biomethane.
Regulations 4, 6, 7, 8, 17 and 22 are amended to extend the operation of the scheme so that the last date that an applicant may be registered as a participant is 31 March 2028. This means that biomethane injected into the gas grid by participants will be eligible to receive tariff payments until 31 March 2043.
New regulation 8A is inserted to introduce a new concept of an “eligible heat pump”, and outline the process for registration of, or review of a registration for an eligible heat pump by the Authority.
Regulation 9 is amended to introduce a new obligation on participants to inform the authority of electrical input supplied to any eligible heat pump. Regulation 10 is amended to introduce a new requirement to notify the Authority if a participant has installed a ground source, or air source heat pump for the production of biomethane.
Regulation 27 is amended to update the definition of “eligible biomethane” to ensure that heat that is derived from an eligible heat pump is able to be deducted from the calculation. A new value was added to the formula to ensure that electricity that is input into an eligible heat pump is also deducted from the calculation.
Schedule 1A is inserted to provide detail of the information that the Authority may require of an applicant or participant to determine whether a heat pump is an eligible heat pump.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

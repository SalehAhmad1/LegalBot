(4) This paragraph applies if the proposed contract is for the supply of goods, works or services and the Secretary of State has made any direct payment for the development of those goods, works or services.
(5) Where the commercial pricing method may be used by virtue of more than one contract described in paragraph (3) (“the relevant contracts”), the Secretary of State must determine a reasonable price for the goods, works or services—
(a)
by reference to all of the relevant contracts; or
(b)
where it is not practicable to determine a reasonable price by reference to all of the relevant contracts, by reference to a representative sample of the relevant contracts.

(ii)
the volume of the goods, works or services to be provided will not have been subject to a competitive process; and
(d)
the conditions in regulation 9(3) or 60(3) apply to the framework agreement.

an error has been identified in the determination of the contract profit rate in accordance with regulation 11; or
(b)
the parties agree that an adjustment should be made to the contract profit rate in accordance with regulation 11(6) (“the step 3 incentive adjustment”).
(4) The method of determining the price is—
(a)
in the circumstances described in paragraph (3)(a), for the price to be adjusted by an amount which ensures that the contract profit rate is as it would have been if the error had not been made;
(b)
in the circumstances described in paragraph (3)(b), for the price to be adjusted to reflect the change to the step 3 incentive adjustment agreed between the parties.

(a)
the price of each of the components (“the total component price”); and
(b)
the value of the adjustment agreed in accordance with paragraphs (3) to (7).
(3) Paragraph (4) applies where—
(a)
the contract requires the primary contractor to integrate outputs from different components of the contract; and
(b)
the parties are satisfied that the cost risk adjustments (see step 2 of regulation 11) made in respect of the components of the contract are insufficient to reflect the financial risks to the primary contractor of entering into the contract, taking account of the requirement to integrate outputs from different components of the contract.
(4) Where this paragraph applies, adjust the total component price by an amount (“the total cost risk adjustment”), so as to reflect the financial risks to the primary contractor under the contract, taking into account the particular types of activities to be carried out by the primary contractor under the contract, including the integration of outputs from different components of the contract.
(5) The total cost risk adjustment must, when added to the cost risk adjustments agreed in respect of all components of the contract, not exceed the sum of all costs risk adjustments under the contract had the parties agreed an adjustment of plus 25% of the baseline profit rate when pricing each component of the contract.
(6) Where the Secretary of State determines that the primary contractor should be given a particular financial incentive as regards the performance of provisions of the contract specified by the Secretary of State, the contract price may be increased by an amount (“the total incentive adjustment”) specified by the Secretary of State.
(7) The maximum amount of the total incentive adjustment is—
(a)
the total of any incentive adjustments (see step 3 of regulation 11) that might be made in respect of the individual components of the contract that have been priced in accordance with the default pricing method, less
(b)

Ministry of Defence
22nd March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2 of the Defence Reform Act 2014 (c. 20) (“the Act”) establishes a regulatory framework for single source contracts (that is, contracts which are not subject to competitive tendering processes) to procure goods, works and services for defence purposes. The framework applies to qualifying defence contracts (that is, contracts to which the Secretary of State is a party and which meet the criteria in section 14(2) of the Act) and to qualifying sub-contracts (that is, contracts intended to secure the delivery of goods, works or services required under a qualifying defence contract and which meet the criteria in section 28(3) or (4) of the Act). The framework is overseen and monitored by the Single Source Regulations Office (“the SSRO”), a non-departmental public body established by the Act. The Single Source Contract Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/3337) (“the Principal Regulations”) were made to implement the detail of the Act’s framework.
Part 2 of the Act has been amended by Schedule 10 to the Procurement Act 2023 (c. 54) for three broad purposes—
(a)
to expand the definition of “qualifying defence contracts” to include contracts which procure goods, works and services which are substantially (as well as wholly) for defence purposes,
(b)
to authorise the introduction of a wider range of pricing methods (“alternative pricing methods”) to account for the range of commercial circumstances in which single source contracts operate, and
(c)
to more easily enable distinct parts of qualifying defence contracts to be separated into components of the contract so that they can be priced distinctly and managed appropriately.
These Regulations amend the Principal Regulations to implement the detail of these amendments to the Act. In particular—
(a)
regulation 4 substitutes regulation 3 of the Principal Regulations to provide a new definition of contracts which are “substantially for defence purposes”;
(b)
regulation 11 inserts new regulation 9A into the Principal Regulations to describe the circumstances in which a part of a contract becomes a component of the contract;
(c)
regulation 12 inserts new regulation 9B into the Principal Regulations to introduce the mechanism by which the parties to a qualifying defence contract may agree to price the contract (or a component of such a contract) using an alternative pricing method instead of an existing pricing method;
(d)
regulation 24 inserts into the Principal Regulations the descriptions of the new alternative pricing methods—
(i)
new regulation 19A describes how to price a contract or component for the supply of goods, works or services which have previously been provided on a commercial basis;
(ii)
new regulation 19B describes how to price a contract or component for the supply of goods, works or services the price of which is affected by law (whether of the United Kingdom or otherwise);
(iii)
new regulation 19C describes how to price a contract which was not, but has become, a qualifying defence contract, and how to price the supply of goods, works or services which were to be provided under one qualifying defence contract and are now to be provided under another;
(iv)
new regulation 19D describes how to price a contract which is novated;
(v)
new regulation 19E describes how to price a contract or component for the supply of goods, works or services the unit price or rate of which has been agreed pursuant to a competitive process, but the volume has not;
(vi)
new regulation 19F describes how to price a contract or component where there has been error in the calculation of the contract profit rate under regulation 11, or where the parties agree that a change should be made to the incentive adjustment element of contract profit rate;
(vii)
new regulation 19G describes how to price a contract which contains components where the parties wish to make an adjustment to the price to account for commercial risk arising from the aggregation of the components;
(e)
regulations 26 to 35 amend Part 5 of the Principal Regulations, primarily to modify and expand contract reporting requirements to secure that components of contracts are properly reported on;
(f)
regulations 39 and 40 amend regulations 51 and 52 of the Principal Regulations to expand the matters on which the SSRO is required to give an opinion or make a determination, primarily in consequence of the introduction of alternative pricing mechanisms;
(g)
regulation 42 amends regulation 65 of the Principal Regulations to secure that the amendments made by these Regulations are modified appropriately in their application to qualifying sub-contracts;
(h)
regulation 43 amends the Schedule to the Principal Regulations, primarily to add a new Part 4 of that Schedule which deals with the re-determination of the price of a qualifying defence contract, or a component of such a contract, which was originally priced under an alternative pricing mechanism and which is subsequently amended.
These Regulations make further minor amendments to the Principal Regulations in consequence of the amendments to the Act and to correct errors.

This Order amends article 9 of the Dangerous Dogs (Compensation and Exemption Schemes) (England and Wales) Order 2023 (S.I. 2023/1204) (“the first Order”) and article 7 of the Dangerous Dogs (Exemption Schemes and Miscellaneous Provisions) (England and Wales) Order 2023 (S.I. 2023/1407) (“the second Order”).
Article 9 of the first Order and article 7 of the second Order impose requirements in relation to the neutering of XL Bully dogs in respect of which certificates of exemption have been granted under those Orders. In the case of an XL Bully dog that was at least 12 months old on 31st January 2024, the holder of a certificate of exemption in respect of such a dog must ensure that the dog is neutered on or before 30th June 2024. The holder must also, on or before that date, provide the Secretary of State with such evidence as the Secretary of State may reasonably require that the dog has been neutered. This Order amends these requirements to allow the holder of such a certificate of exemption to provide that evidence to the Secretary of State no later than 26th July 2024.

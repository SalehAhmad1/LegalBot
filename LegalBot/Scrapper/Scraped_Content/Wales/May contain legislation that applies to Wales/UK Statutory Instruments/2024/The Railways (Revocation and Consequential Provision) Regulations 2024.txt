(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke 11 items of secondary assimilated law (as defined in section 21(1) of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (c. 28)) for Great Britain which make provision about the regulation of railways.
The revoked secondary assimilated law relates specifically to:
(a)
interoperability: four of these instruments relate to the establishment and operation of the European Agency for Railways. The Agency no longer has a role in Great Britain, and so these instruments are redundant. Two of these instruments relate to EU railway technical standards which no longer apply to Great Britain;
(b)
access to railway infrastructure and costs: four of these instruments make provision which relates to the charges relating to, and access to railway infrastructure and certain services. These instruments are considered unnecessarily prescriptive; and
(c)
accident investigation reports: one instrument which sets out requirements for the reports published by rail accident and incident investigators. The requirements in this instrument are considered unnecessarily prescriptive.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside this instrument at www.legislation.gov.uk.

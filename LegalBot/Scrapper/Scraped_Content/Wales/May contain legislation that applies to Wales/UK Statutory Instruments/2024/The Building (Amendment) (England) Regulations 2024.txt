14th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Building Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2214) as they apply in relation to England to set requirements in respect of toilet accommodation in buildings other than dwellings.
Regulation 2(4) inserts a new Part T into Schedule 1 (requirements) to the Building Regulations 2010 to require male and female single-sex toilets in buildings other than dwellings. Universal toilets may be provided in addition to single-sex toilets or where space precludes provision of single-sex toilets. Limits on the application of this requirement exclude en-suite facilities in individual rooms for residential purposes, residential rooms in care homes, schools and premises used wholly or mainly for early years provision and cellular accommodation in custodial facilities.
Regulation 3 contains transitional provisions. The new requirement will not apply where a building notice, an initial notice, or an application for building control approval with full plans, has been given to the relevant authority in respect of that building, before the day the Regulations come into force and the work has either started by that day or starts in the 6 months following that day.
An impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs to business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available with the explanatory memorandum for these Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

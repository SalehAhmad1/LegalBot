at 10.45 a.m. on 17th April 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in England and Wales, amend the Boiler Upgrade Scheme (England and Wales) Regulations 2022 S.I. 2022/565 (“the 2022 Regulations”), which established the Boiler Upgrade Scheme (“BUS”). BUS is a renewable heat incentive scheme to facilitate and encourage the use of heat pumps and biomass boilers to provide space and water heating in domestic properties and small non-domestic properties. BUS supports the installation of heat pumps and biomass boilers through a grant mechanism provided that they do not replace an existing renewable heating system.
Regulation 2 is amended to introduce new definitions, or provide updated definitions in relation to the other amendments being made by these Regulations.
Regulations 2, 15 and 30 are amended to update relevant dates to extend the operation of BUS to 2028.
Regulation 4 is amended to add in to the power of the Secretary of State to approve standards or schemes for the 2022 Regulations the power to approve codes for consumer protection for the purpose of the definition of consumer code.
Part 2 is amended. Regulation 5 updates the criteria for an eligible property. Regulation 6 in relation to insulation requirements is omitted. Regulation 7 is updated to ensure that defined property developments are explicitly excluded from BUS eligibility.
Part 3 is amended. Regulation 8 is amended to introduce a requirement that an eligible plant is commissioned no more than 120 days before the date a grant application is properly made. Regulation 9 is amended to increase the capacity of shared ground loop systems and make consequential amendments from the removal of insulation requirements. Regulation 10 is amended to extend eligibility for BUS to biomass boilers that have an integrated cooking function that cannot be independently controlled.
Part 4 is amended. Regulation 13 is amended to introduce the new process for determining the available categories of boiler upgrade grant. Regulation 15 is amended to require that the category of boiler upgrade grant is specified on the boiler upgrade voucher. Regulation 16 is amended to include a power to audit information provided when determining a redemption application.
Part 5 is amended. Regulations 17 and 24 are amended to ensure that obligations apply under this regulation where an application has been made, and where a boiler upgrade voucher has been issued. Regulations 18, 19, 20 and 21 are amended as a consequential amendment to the removal of the insulation requirements.
Schedule 1A is inserted to introduce sets of mutually exclusive grant categories. The Secretary of State can be introduced to differentiate, if needed, the available grant categories to provide more targeted support for off gas grid properties and the fuel type being replaced and/or for new-build properties.
Schedule 2 is amended to make consequential amendments to the information required for a grant application.
Schedule 3 is amended to make consequential amendments to the information required for a redemption application.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Headcorn Aerodrome, Kent 
during flying displays for the public that are due to take place there between 5th July 2024 and 7th 
July 2024 (inclusive). 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the 
Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in 
the vicinity of the displays for reasons of public safety. 
These Regulations apply except insofar as flying is already prohibited by the Air Navigation 
(Restriction of Flying) (Prisons and Young Offender Institutions) (England and Wales) 
Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1101). 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(b), the Headcorn Airshow flying display 
director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr Alan Frew, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 0330 1382734.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 99 of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376), which sets out the circumstances in which work search and work availability requirements must not be imposed on a universal credit claimant. Regulation 2 amends paragraph (6) of regulation 99 so that work search and work availability requirements may not be imposed where a claimant has monthly earnings from employment that are equal to, or more than, 18 hours per week at the national minimum wage rate as set out in regulation 4 of the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/621) (“the national living wage”) or, where the claimant is a member of a couple, their combined earnings from employment are equal to, or more than, 29 hours per week at the national living wage rate, in both cases converted to a monthly amount by multiplying by 52 and dividing by 12. Regulation 3 revokes a previous version of these Regulations in order to alter the coming into force date.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

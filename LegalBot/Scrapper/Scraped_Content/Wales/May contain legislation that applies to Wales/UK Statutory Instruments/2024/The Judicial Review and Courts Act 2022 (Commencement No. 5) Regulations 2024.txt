(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force section 44 of the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (c. 35) (“the Act”). They are the fifth commencement regulations to be made under the Act.
Section 44 of the Act inserts paragraph (4) in section 23 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953. New paragraph (4) enables the registrar to register a death on the basis of information furnished by the senior coroner, on request by the registrar, provided the senior coroner has discontinued their investigation and authorised the disposal of the body. This provision may be relied upon by the registrar where a qualified informant (ordinarily a family member) is unable or unwilling to provide such information, and the senior coroner has established the relevant information as part of their initial investigation.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT REGULATIONS

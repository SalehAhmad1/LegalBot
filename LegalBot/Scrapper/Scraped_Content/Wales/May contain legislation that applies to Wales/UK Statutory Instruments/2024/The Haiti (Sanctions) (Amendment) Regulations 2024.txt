20th February 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) for the purposes of implementing obligations that the United Kingdom has by virtue of the arms embargo contained in UN Security Council Resolution 2653 (2022), adopted by the UN Security Council on 21st October 2022, as amended by UN Security Council Resolution 2699 (2023), adopted by the UN Security Council on 2nd October 2023, and UN Security Council Resolution 2700 (2023), adopted by the UN Security Council on 19th October 2023.
On 28th December 2023, the Haiti (Sanctions) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1320) (“the 2023 Regulations”) came into force and which amended the Haiti (Sanctions) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1281) (“the 2022 Regulations”). These Regulations correct errors and omissions in the 2022 Regulations as introduced by the 2023 Regulations. Regulations 15(1), 16(1) and 17(1) are amended so that references to “military goods” or “military goods or military technology” are replaced by references to “small arms, light weapons and ammunition”. These Regulations also amend regulations 36(2)(a) and 46(1) of the 2022 Regulations, as amended by the 2023 Regulations, so that the header to regulation 15 has the identifier “(export of small arms, light weapons and ammunition)” instead of “(export of military goods)”. A further amendment is made to paragraph 6(a) of Schedule 1A to the 2022 Regulations, which was introduced by the 2023 Regulations, and concerns the definition of “small arms, light weapons and ammunition”. This amendment expands the definition slightly by reference to Schedule 2 to the Export Control Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/3231).

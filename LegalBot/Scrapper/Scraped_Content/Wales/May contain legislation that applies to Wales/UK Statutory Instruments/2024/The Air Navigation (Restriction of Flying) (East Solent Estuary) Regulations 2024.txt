EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of the East Solent Estuary, 
Bracklesham Bay, West Sussex by reason of the intended holding there of a Royal Aero Club Air 
Race on 22nd June 2024 and 23rd June 2024. 
A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the event and 
therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should 
be restricted in the vicinity of the air race for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permissions mentioned in regulation 3(2)(a), the Solent Air Race air-ground 
service and the Royal Aero Club Records, Racing and Rally Association Race Officials may be 
contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr Alan Frew, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 382734.

At 2.33 p.m. on 29th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) (Prescription of Drugs etc.) Regulations 2004 (“the 2004 Regulations”). The 2004 Regulations prohibit or restrict the ordering of specified prescription items under a general medical services (GMS) contract in England.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations inserts provisions into the 2004 Regulations that restrict the ordering by authorised prescribers at GP practices that hold GMS contracts of a list of medicinal products that consist of or contain gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. The restrictions relate to orders for GnRH analogues for patients who are under the age of 18, if they are prescribed for the purpose of puberty suppression in respect of gender dysphoria, gender incongruence or a combination of both.
An assessment of the effect of this instrument was undertaken and it was deemed that a full impact assessment would not be undertaken. These Regulations are not expected to have a significant impact on the public and voluntary sectors, and only a limited impact on the private sector, below the threshold for undertaking a full impact assessment.

Section 29(3) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 (c. 2) enables the Secretary of State to specify in an Order the overall maximum recoverable amount that a returning officer may recover in respect of services rendered or expenses incurred for or in connection with a parliamentary election.
This Order specifies the overall maximum recoverable amounts in respect of each constituency in Northern Ireland (of which there are 18). At an uncontested election in any constituency the overall maximum recoverable amount is £1,750.00. At a contested election, the maximum amount recoverable in total is £5,600,000.00, which is the sum of the overall maximum recoverable amount for each constituency set out in the table in the Schedule to the Order.
This Order also revokes the Parliamentary Elections (Returning Officer’s Charges) (Northern Ireland) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/652).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

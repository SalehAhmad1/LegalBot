17 June 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Central Rating List (Wales) Regulations 2005 (“the 2005 Regulations”). The 2005 Regulations designate persons and prescribe, in relation to those persons, one or more descriptions of non-domestic hereditament. The amendments made by these Regulations reflect the change of name of certain designated persons, and remove those who are no longer liable for certain non-domestic hereditaments. Company numbers for each designated person are also inserted. The effect is to ensure the 2005 Regulations accurately reflect the designated persons and the corresponding descriptions of hereditaments on the Central Rating List for Wales.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for the certification of deaths in England and Wales by attending practitioners and medical examiners.
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision for the completion and confirmation of an attending practitioner’s certificate in relation to a death.
Regulation 3 requires an attending practitioner to prepare and sign an attending practitioner’s certificate stating the cause of death, or alternatively to refer the death to the relevant senior coroner in specified circumstances.
Regulation 4 sets out the obligations of attending practitioners and relevant senior coroners where a case has been referred by an attending practitioner to a senior coroner, and the process for making such a referral.
Regulation 6 requires the appropriate medical examiner to make appropriate enquiries and take into account specified information with a view to confirming the cause of death.
Regulation 7 requires the relevant attending practitioner to be available to respond to any enquiries that the appropriate medical examiner might have in connection to the attending practitioner’s certificate, and that the appropriate medical examiner must make a record of any response to such enquiries.
Regulation 8 requires the appropriate medical examiner (or someone acting on their behalf) to discuss the cause of death with the prospective informant or such other person as the examiner considers appropriate.
Regulation 9 requires the appropriate medical examiner to confirm the cause of death by signing the attending practitioner’s certificate once they are satisfied that the specified conditions have been met. In the alternative, regulation 10 requires the appropriate medical examiner to refer the death to the relevant senior coroner, and sets out the duties of appropriate medical examiners and relevant senior coroners following such a referral.
Regulation 11 requires that, where an appropriate medical examiner is able to confirm the cause of death stated on the attending practitioner’s certificate, that without unreasonable delay the confirmed attending practitioner’s certificate is given to the registrar and reasonable steps are taken to ensure that a prospective informant is aware that they have done so.
Regulation 12 provides that a registrar must consult with an appropriate medical examiner where an informant provides the registrar with information which leads that registrar to believe that the cause of death stated on the confirmed attending practitioner’s certificate may need to be revised. The appropriate medical examiner may invite an attending practitioner to revise the attending practitioner’s certificate.
Regulation 13 sets out the duties of attending practitioners and appropriate medical examiners where the appropriate medical examiner has invited the attending practitioner to revise the attending practitioner’s certificate.
Regulation 14 provides that where the attending practitioner is unable to carry out their duties within a reasonable time, another attending practitioner must carry out any duties imposed under Part 2.
Part 3 of these Regulations makes provision for the completion of a medical examiner’s certificate in relation to a death.
Regulation 15 requires a senior coroner to refer a death to the appropriate medical examiner in certain cases.
Regulation 17 requires a medical examiner, upon receipt of a referral made under regulation 15, to review the deceased’s health records, make relevant enquiries and consider any other relevant information with a view to establishing the cause of death to the best of the examiner’s knowledge and belief.
Regulation 18 requires the appropriate medical examiner to discuss the cause of death with the prospective informant or such other person as considered appropriate.
Regulation 19 requires the appropriate medical examiner to prepare and sign a medical examiner’s certificate where the appropriate medical examiner is able to establish a cause of death. In the alternative, regulation 20 requires the appropriate medical examiner to refer the death back to the relevant senior coroner, and sets out the requirements on appropriate medical examiners and senior coroners following such a referral.
Regulation 21 requires that, where an appropriate medical examiner has issued a medical examiner’s certificate under regulation 19, that without unreasonable delay the certificate is given to the registrar and reasonable steps are taken to ensure that a prospective informant is aware that they have done so.
Regulation 22 provides for a registrar to invite an appropriate medical examiner to revise the medical examiner’s certificate where an informant provides the registrar with information which leads that registrar to believe that the cause of death stated on the confirmed attending practitioner’s certificate may need to be revised.
Regulation 23 sets out the duties on appropriate medical examiners where the registrar has invited the appropriate medical examiner to revise the medical examiner’s certificate.
Part 4 of the Regulations makes various miscellaneous provisions regarding the electronic sending or completion of documents (regulation 24) and the availability of certificates and forms (regulation 25).
Part 5 of the Regulations include a transitional provision (regulation 26) which provides that these regulations apply to deaths occurring before the coming into force of these Regulations where a medical certificate of death has not been signed and a senior coroner is not under a duty to hold an inquest into the death.

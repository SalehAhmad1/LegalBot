5th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Some criminal justice orders may contain an electronic monitoring requirement, either to monitor whereabouts of the individual, or to monitor compliance with other conditions or requirements of the relevant order. A person may not be made responsible for the monitoring of individuals unless they are of a description specified by the Secretary of State.
These Regulations specify that a person of a description who may be named as a responsible person for electronic monitoring is one employed by the companies named in the Regulations. The Regulations cover a number of types of order under several different pieces of criminal justice legislation. These include responsible persons for electronic monitoring of persons on bail, on remand to local authority accommodation, subject to youth rehabilitation orders, subject to community orders and suspended sentence orders, and subject to domestic abuse protection orders. There have been a number of instruments specifying descriptions of persons for each of these purposes. These Regulations revoke and consolidate those instruments. The Regulations also reflect the addition of Serco Limited as a responsible person for the orders described in regulations 3 to 8.
The instruments set out in regulation 9(1) name employees or police officers of Hertfordshire police area and Buddi Limited as responsible persons under a number of types of order. These instruments are revoked on the same day that these Regulations come into force. The instruments set out in regulation 9(2) name an employee of Capita Business Services Ltd as a person who may be named as a responsible person under a number of types of order. These instruments will be revoked on 31st January 2025.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

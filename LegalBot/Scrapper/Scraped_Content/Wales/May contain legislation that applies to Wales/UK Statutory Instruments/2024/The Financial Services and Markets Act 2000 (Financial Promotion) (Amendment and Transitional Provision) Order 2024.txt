This Order amends the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Promotion of Collective Investment Schemes) (Exemptions) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/1060) (“PCIS”) and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (S.I. 2005/1529) (“FPO”).
Article 3 substitutes the statements in the Schedule to the PCIS with amended statements. Article 4 substitutes the statements in Schedule 5 to the FPO with amended statements.
In relation to the high net worth individual investor statements, for the purposes of the PCIS and FPO respectively: the annual income condition has been reduced from £170,000 or more to £100,000 or more, and the net assets condition has been reduced from £430,000 or more to £250,000 or more.

Article 5 makes transitional provisions. Paragraphs (1) to (4) set out that before 31st January 2025, the statements appended to the Schedule to the PCIS and Schedule 5 to the FPO (as they are prior to being substituted by this Order) will have effect as alternative statements to those inserted by this Order.

(This note is not part of the Order)
Under section 55 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 (c. 13), a returning officer may recover charges in respect of services rendered, or expenses incurred, for or in connection with an election if the services were necessarily rendered, or the expenses necessarily incurred, for the efficient and effective conduct of a police and crime commissioner election (“PCC election”). Those charges may not however exceed the overall maximum recoverable amount specified by the Secretary of State, with the consent of the Treasury, in an order. An order may also specify the maximum amount that may be recovered in respect of any specified services or expenses.
Articles 4 and 5 of, and Schedule 1 to, this Order specify the maximum amounts for specified services and specified expenses, and the overall maximum amount, that may be recovered by a local returning officer in respect of a voting area at the PCC elections scheduled for 2nd May 2024, some of which are combined with other elections.
Articles 4 and 5, and Schedule 2, provide maximum recoverable amounts for PCC elections taken alone following 2nd May 2024 to fill a vacancy in the office of police and crime commissioner.
Articles 6 and 7 and Schedule 3 specify the overall maximum amount and the maximum amounts for specified services and specified expenses that may be recovered by a police area returning officer in respect of a police area at a PCC election.
Article 8 specifies the maximum amounts that may be recovered (instead of the amounts referred to above) where an election is uncontested.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

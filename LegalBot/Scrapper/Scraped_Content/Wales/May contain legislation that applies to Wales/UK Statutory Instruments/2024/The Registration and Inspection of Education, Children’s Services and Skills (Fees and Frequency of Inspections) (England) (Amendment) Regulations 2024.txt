Regulation 15 sets the annual fee payable in respect of both small and large supported accommodation undertakings by inserting a new regulation 26A. Regulation 12 amends regulation 18 in consequence of the insertion of regulation 26A.
Regulation 16 amends regulation 27 in respect of the inspection frequency of children’s homes where there are no children being accommodated in the home at the time of the first inspection.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and replace the M621 Motorway (Speed Limit) Regulations 2000 which imposed speed limit restrictions on the M621 Motorway in Leeds. They also revoke the M621 Motorway (Speed Limit) (Amendment) Regulations 2007, which amended the M621 Motorway (Speed Limit) Regulations 2000.
These Regulations impose new speed limits on specified lengths of the M621 Motorway, to take account of improvements to the road layout. The speed limit provisions are as follows—
(a)
Regulation 3(1) and Schedule 1 of these Regulations impose a 50 miles per hour speed limit on the specified lengths of the M621 motorway;
(b)
Regulation 3(2) and Schedule 2 of these Regulations impose a 40 miles per hour speed limit on specified lengths of the M621 motorway; and
(c)
Regulation 3(3) and Schedule 3 of these Regulations impose a 30 miles per hour speed limit on specified lengths of the M621 motorway.
Contravention of these Regulations is an offence under section 17(4) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

4th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Carer’s Assistance (Carer Support Payment) (Scotland) Regulations 2023 (S.S.I. 2023/302) introduce arrangements for the payment of carer’s assistance in the form of carer support payment. Carer support payment replaces carer’s allowance as the benefit paid to those in Scotland with eligible caring responsibilities for a disabled person.
This instrument makes consequential amendments to social security legislation in England and Wales and Scotland. In particular, it amends the Social Security (Payments on account, Overpayments and Recovery) Regulations 1988 (S.I. 1988/664) to provide that carer support payments are offset against payments of social security benefits.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

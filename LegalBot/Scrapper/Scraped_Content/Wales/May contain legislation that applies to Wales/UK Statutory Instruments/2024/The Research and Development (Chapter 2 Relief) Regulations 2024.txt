any relevant activity in relation to electricity, and

the company notifies an officer of Revenue and Customs in writing that it wishes to rely on this paragraph.

each previous accounting period of the company that began on or after 1st April 2024 and ended within the period of 3 years ending with the final day of the accounting period in question.
(4) The formula is—
where—
A is the amount by which the liability of the company to pay corporation tax (in any accounting period) is reduced as a result of the Chapter 2 relief obtained by the company for the period;
B is the sum of any amounts by which the liability of any other company to pay corporation tax (in any accounting period) is reduced by virtue of a loss that—
(a)
arises as a result of the Chapter 2 relief obtained by the company for the period, and
(b)
is surrendered by the company to the other company under Part 5 or 5A of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 (surrender of relief between members of groups and consortia);
C is the amount of R&D tax credit to which the company is entitled, and which it claims, for the period; and
D is the amount that would have been the third amount referred to in section 1042K of CTA 2009 (initial amount of expenditure credit minus notional tax deduction) had the expenditure in respect of which the company claims Chapter 2 relief instead been the subject of a claim for relief under Chapter 1A of Part 13 of CTA 2009.
(1)
For the meaning of “R&D tax credit”, see section 1054 of CTA 2009. That section was amended by paragraph 2(4) of Schedule 1 to the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 and paragraph 6(10) of Schedule 1 to the Finance Act 2024.

At 1.55 p.m. on 11th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations relate to the additional relief for research-and-development-intensive, loss-making small or medium-sized enterprises under Chapter 2 of Part 13 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009 (“CTA 2009”) as it applies in relation to accounting periods beginning on or after 1st April 2024. They provide for specific rules to apply to companies with a registered office in Northern Ireland in two ways. First, payments by such companies for R&D undertaken outside the United Kingdom will qualify for Chapter 2 relief without the company having to show that special circumstances exist (of the sort referred to in section 1138A(2) and (3) of CTA 2009). Second, the additional benefit obtained by such companies from claiming Chapter 2 relief instead of R&D expenditure credit (under Chapter 1A of Part 13 of CTA 2009) will not exceed £250,000 over any 3-year period. These provisions take account of the specific market conditions in Northern Ireland. The limit on relief will protect against the fiscal risk from the more generous treatment of overseas expenditure.

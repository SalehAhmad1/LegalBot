1st March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Schedule 2 to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (c. 25) divided England and Wales into coroner areas. It established that the Lord Chancellor may, by order, both specify and alter these. Subsequently, the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Coroner Areas and Assistant Coroners) Transitional Order 2013 (S.I. 2013/1625), which came into force on 25th July 2013, established that certain “coroner’s districts” - as constituted under the Coroners Act 1988 (c. 13) - were to be specified as coroner areas.
This Order creates three new coroner areas: Greater Lincolnshire, County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay and Northumberland. The Greater Lincolnshire coroner area is created by combining the North Lincolnshire and Grimsby coroner area with the Lincolnshire coroner area. The County of Devon, Plymouth and Torbay coroner area is created by combining the Exeter and Greater Devon coroner area with the Plymouth, Torbay and South Devon coroner area. The Northumberland coroner area is created by combining the North Northumberland coroner area with the South Northumberland coroner area.

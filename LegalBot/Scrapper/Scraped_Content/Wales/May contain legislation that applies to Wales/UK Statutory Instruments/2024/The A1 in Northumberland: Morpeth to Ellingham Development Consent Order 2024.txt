(2) Where a highway (other than a trunk road which will remain a trunk road following the exercise of the powers in article 15 (classification of roads etc.)) is altered or diverted under this Order, the altered or diverted part of the highway must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority in whose area the highway lies and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(3) Where a highway is detrunked under this Order—
(a)
section 265 (transfer of property and liabilities upon a highway becoming or ceasing to be a trunk road)(1) of the 1980 Act applies in respect of that highway; and

(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause dangers to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.

at any time before or during the carrying out in the vicinity of the building of any part of the authorised development; or

(ii)
a right under paragraph (3) to enter a building and land within its curtilage;
(iii)
a right under paragraph (4)(a) to enter a building and land within its curtilage; or

protective works are carried out under this article to a building; and
(b)
within the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which the part of the authorised development carried out in the vicinity of the building is first opened for use it appears that the protective works are inadequate to protect the building against damage caused by the carrying out or use of that part of the authorised development,
the undertaker must compensate the owners and occupiers of the building for any loss or damage sustained by them.

(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in such position as described in sub-paragraph (a).

apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.

3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(2) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection)(3), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.—(1) Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 32 (modifications of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 27 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 30 (compulsory acquisition of rights and imposition of restrictive covenants)—
(a)
with the modification specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(1)(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restrictive covenant is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severence) of the 1965 Act substitute—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(4) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, as from the date on which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right, or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 27), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant ; and sections—
(a)
11A(5) (powers of entry: further notices of entry);
(b)
11B(6) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date);
(c)
12(7) (penalty for unauthorised entry); and
(d)
13(8) (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act,
are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(9) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 32(3) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and has not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 33 (application of the 1981 Act) of the A1 in Northumberland: Morpeth to Ellingham Development Consent Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 34(3) (acquisition of subsoil and airspace only) of the A1 in Northumberland: Morpeth to Ellingham Development Consent Order 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat;
(b)
accept the counter-notice; or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory; or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant;
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed; and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

On street apparatus
3.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus in stopped up streets
4.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 17 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access), any utility undertaker whose apparatus is in the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to the utility undertaker legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the utility undertaker in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of the utility undertaker to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 7 (removal of apparatus) or the power of the undertaker to carry out works under paragraph 9 (retained apparatus).
(2) Regardless of the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under the powers conferred by article 16 (temporary alteration, diversion, prohibition and restriction of the use of streets), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
5.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 25 (protective work to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
Acquisition of land
6.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (6).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed the utility undertaker must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 49, and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
9.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2) (removal of apparatus), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses and costs
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker all expenses reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2) (removal of apparatus).
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 5 (protective work to buildings) or 7(2) (removal of apparatus), or by reason of any subsidence resulting from such development or works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Co-operation
12.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, the undertaker or a utility undertaker requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 7(2) (removal of apparatus) or a utility undertaker makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 9 (retained apparatus), the undertaker must use best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the utility undertaker’s undertaking and each utility undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
13.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
PART 2
FOR THE PROTECTION OF OPERATORS OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS CODE NETWORKS

15.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“the 2003 Act” means the Communications Act 2003;
“electronic communications apparatus” has the same meaning as in the electronic communications code;
“the electronic communications code” has the same meaning as in Chapter 1 (electronic communications networks and services) of Part 2 (networks, services and the radio spectrum) of the 2003 Act(5);
“electronic communications code network” means—
(a)
so much of an electronic communications network or infrastructure system provided by an electronic communications code operator as is not excluded from the application of the electronic communications code by a direction under section 106 of the 2003 Act; and
(b)
an electronic communications network which the undertaker is providing or proposing to provide;
“electronic communications code operator” means a person in whose case the electronic communications code is applied by a direction under section 106 of the 2003 Act;
“infrastructure system” has the same meaning as in the electronic communications code and references to providing an infrastructure system are to be construed in accordance with paragraph 7 of that code; and

Apparatus of National Gas in stopped up streets
26.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 17 (permanent stopping up, restriction of use and construction of streets, public rights of way and private means of access), if National Gas has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street National Gas has the same rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to National Gas, or procure the granting to National Gas of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to National Gas in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up of any such street but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or National Gas to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 29 (removal of apparatus) or the power of the undertaker, subject to compliance with this sub-paragraph, to carry out works under paragraph 31 (retained apparatus: protection of gas undertaker).
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary alteration, diversion, prohibition and restriction of the use of any street under the powers of article 16 (temporary alteration, diversion, prohibitionand restriction f the use of streets), National Gas is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the alteration, diversion, prohibition or restriction was in that street.
Protective works to buildings
27.  The undertaker must exercise the powers conferred by article 25 (protective work to buildings) so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of National Gas (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
Acquisition of land
28.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker may not acquire any interest in land or apparatus or override any easement or other interest of National Gas otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between National Gas and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of National Gas or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Gas and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Gas reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between National Gas and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Gas unless otherwise agreed by National Gas, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure and secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works.
(3) Where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Gas or other enactments relied upon by National Gas as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Part of this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Gas under paragraph 31 (retained apparatus: protection of gas undertaker) or 32 (expenses) or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
29.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Gas to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Gas in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Gas advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Gas reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to National Gas to its reasonable satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 30(1) (facilities and rights for alternative apparatus)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of, or secured by, the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Gas must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for National Gas to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Gas and the undertaker.
(5) National Gas must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the grant to National Gas of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
30.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Gas facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Gas and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Gas than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Gas.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Gas than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 37 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Gas as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of gas undertaker
31.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to National Gas a plan and, if reasonably required by National Gas, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to National Gas under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the specified works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant, etc.;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or within 15m of any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any specified works until National Gas has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of National Gas required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (5) or (7); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) National Gas may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Specified works must only be executed in accordance with—
(a)
the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Gas; and
(b)
such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or (7) by National Gas for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Gas will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where under sub-paragraph (6) National Gas requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker such protective works (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) must be carried out to National Gas’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and National Gas must give notice of its requirement for such works within 56 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(8) If National Gas in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) or (7) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 23 to 25 and 28 to 30 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 29(2) (removal of apparatus).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised works—
(a)
the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme; and
(b)
National Gas retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 32 (expenses).
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to National Gas notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(12) In sub-paragraph (11), “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to, or to prevent the occurrence of, circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works believes on reasonable grounds to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.
Expenses
32.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Gas within 30 days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim from National Gas all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Gas in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Gas in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Gas as a consequence of National Gas—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 29(3) (removal of apparatus); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in this Order transferred to or benefitting National Gas;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 37 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Gas by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Gas in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Gas any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
33.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any part of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by it) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of National Gas, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Gas, or National Gas becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from National Gas the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Gas in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Gas for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Gas, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Gas becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of National Gas.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Gas on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Gas or in accordance with any requirement of National Gas or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless National Gas fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Gas, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any part of the authorised works carried out by National Gas in the exercise of any functions conferred by this Order pursuant to a grant or transfer under article 10 (consent to transfer benefit of Order).
(4) National Gas must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) National Gas must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) National Gas must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within National Gas’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Gas’s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker National Gas must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
Enactments and agreements
34.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Gas in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
35.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised works, the undertaker or National Gas requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 29(2) (removal of apparatus) or National Gas makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 31 (retained apparatus: protection of gas undertaker), the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised works and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Gas’s undertaking and National Gas must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever the undertaker’s or National Gas’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted under this Part of this Schedule, or agreement is required to be reached between the parties under this Part of this Schedule, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
36.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 28(1) (acquisition of land) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable National Gas to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
37.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraphs 29(2) or (4) (removal of apparatus) and 30(1) (facilities and rights for alternative apparatus), any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Gas under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Gas, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration).
Notices

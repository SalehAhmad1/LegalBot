14th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Energy Performance of Building Regulations 2012 (“the Principal Regulations”) in relation to data sharing.
Regulation 4 inserts new regulation 29A into the Principal Regulations which enables the keeper of the register (the Secretary of State), accreditation schemes and energy assessors to share data on the energy performance of a particular building with the owner, landlord or occupier of that building. Data on certain air conditioning systems will also be sharable with anyone who has control of that system. In consequence of regulation 4, regulation 3 amends regulation 29 of the Principal Regulations to provide that data sharing under new regulation 29A is not an offence.
Regulations 5 and 6 amend the Principal Regulations to remove an existing restriction on the types of energy performance-related data that the keeper of the register can publish on a website. Individual building owners or occupiers will still be able to request that data on their building is not published.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

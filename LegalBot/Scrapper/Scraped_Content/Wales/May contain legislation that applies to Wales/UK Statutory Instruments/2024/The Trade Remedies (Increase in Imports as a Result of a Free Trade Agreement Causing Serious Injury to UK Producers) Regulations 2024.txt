4.  In applying the provisions of these Regulations, the TRA and the Secretary of State must have regard to any relevant free trade agreement.Purpose of Part 2
5.  The TRA is to determine, for the purpose of a bilateral safeguarding investigation, whether the goods concerned have been or are being imported into the United Kingdom in increased quantities in accordance with this Part.Increased quantities
6.—(1) The TRA must assess whether—
(a)
the goods concerned have been or are being imported into the United Kingdom in increased quantities by reference to a period of time for which it determines that there is sufficient data available in order for it to make that assessment (the “period of investigation”), and
(b)
any such increase during the period of investigation is due to the goods concerned having benefited from a reduction or elimination of import duty as a result of the relevant free trade agreement.
(2) In order to determine whether the goods concerned are imported into the United Kingdom in increased volumes for the purpose of paragraph 1(1)(a) of Schedule 5 to the Act, the TRA must determine whether there has been—
(a)
an absolute increase in the volume of the goods concerned imported into the United Kingdom, or
(b)
a relative increase in the volume of the goods concerned imported into the United Kingdom compared with the total domestic production in the United Kingdom of the like goods and directly competitive goods.
(3) When making a determination under paragraph (2), the TRA may take into account any information it considers relevant.
(4) The TRA must consider imports of the goods concerned when making a determination under paragraph (2) unless regulation 49 (exceptions) applies.Significant increase in the importation of the goods concerned
7.—(1) Where the TRA determines under regulation 6 (increased quantities) that—
(a)
there has been an increase in the volume of the goods concerned imported into the United Kingdom, and
(b)
the increase is due to the goods concerned having benefited from a reduction or elimination of import duty as a result of the relevant free trade agreement,
the TRA must determine whether that increase is significant for the purpose of paragraph 1(1)(b) of Schedule 5 to the Act.
(2) For the purpose of paragraph (1), the TRA must consider—
(a)
the rate and volume of imports of the goods concerned into the United Kingdom, and
(b)
any other factors it considers relevant.Serious injury
8.  Where the TRA has determined in accordance with paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the Act and Part 2 of these Regulations that the goods concerned have been or are being imported into the United Kingdom in increased quantities, it must consider whether those goods have caused or are causing serious injury to UK producers in accordance with this Part.Determination of serious injury
9.—(1) The TRA is to determine whether UK producers of the like goods and directly competitive goods have suffered or are suffering serious injury for the purpose of paragraph 6 of Schedule 5 to the Act(1) in accordance with this regulation.
(2) A threat of significant overall impairment to the position of UK producers only arises where the TRA considers that threat to be clearly imminent.
(3) In order to determine whether UK producers have suffered or are suffering serious injury (see paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 to the Act), the TRA must assess all relevant economic factors having a bearing on UK producers including—
(a)
the rate and volume of increase of the importation of the goods concerned into the United Kingdom, in absolute or relative terms;
(b)
the likelihood that the goods concerned will be exported to the United Kingdom in increased quantities, in absolute or relative terms;
(c)
the share of the domestic market in the United Kingdom taken by the importation of the goods concerned in increased quantities;
(d)
changes in the UK producers’ level of—

sales,
(ii)
productivity,
(iii)
production,

capacity utilisation,
(v)
profits and losses, and

employment.
(1)

10.—(1) This regulation applies where the TRA is determining, for the purpose of regulation 9 (determination of serious injury), whether or not serious injury has been or is being caused to UK producers by the importation of the goods concerned in increased quantities into the United Kingdom (“increased importation”).
(2) The TRA may consider—
(a)
price effects of the increased importation on the like goods and directly competitive goods in the United Kingdom, including the depression or suppression of price increases which would otherwise have occurred,
(b)
volume effects of the increased importation on the like goods and directly competitive goods in the United Kingdom, and
(c)
any other known factors that it considers relevant.
(3) The TRA must consider whether any known factors other than the increased importation have caused or are causing serious injury to UK producers.
(4) The TRA must not attribute to the goods concerned injury caused by known factors other than the increased importation.Determination and assessment of an adequate amount to prevent or remove serious injury
11.—(1) For the purpose of paragraphs 12(4), 13(5), 17(4)(a) and 18(5)(a) of Schedule 5 to the Act, the TRA must determine a provisional bilateral safeguarding remedy or definitive bilateral safeguarding remedy (a “relevant remedy”) in accordance with this Part.
(2) The TRA must determine the relevant remedy which it is satisfied is necessary to prevent or remove serious injury to UK producers of the like goods and directly competitive goods based on an assessment of the minimum increase in average import prices of the goods concerned that would prevent or remove serious injury.
(3) In making that assessment, where relevant, the TRA must have regard to—
(a)
the weighted average price of the goods concerned imported into the United Kingdom, and
(b)
an assessment of the prices in the United Kingdom that UK producers of the like goods and directly competitive goods could have expected to achieve under normal conditions of competition in the absence of the importation of the goods concerned in increased quantities into the United Kingdom.Purpose of Part 5

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under sections 13 and 32 of, and Schedule 5 to the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (“the Act”), as applied by Schedule 5A to that Act in relation to bilateral safeguarding remedies.
Schedule 5 to the Act, as so applied, establishes a regime under which the Trade Remedies Authority (“the TRA”), investigates prima facie instances of increases in imports as a result of a free trade agreement causing serious injury to UK producers.
Part 1 (introductory) sets out the introductory provisions of the Regulations and includes the definitions that apply throughout. It makes transitional provision for bilateral safeguarding investigations and reviews already commenced by the Secretary of State before the Regulations come into force.
Part 2 (increased quantities) provides for how the TRA will determine whether or not there are goods imported in increased quantities as a result of a free trade agreement in accordance with paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the Act. The regulations in this Part set out: how the TRA will determine whether there are increased quantities of imports; and whether that increase is significant.
Part 3 (serious injury and causation) provides for how the TRA will determine whether the importation of those goods has caused serious injury to UK producers.
Part 4 (determination of an adequate amount to prevent or remove serious injury and remedies) provides for how the TRA will determine the appropriate remedy under the Act to prevent the serious injury established under Part 3. The regulations make provision in relation to the following remedies under the Act: an additional amount of import duty or a tariff rate quota or the suspension of a tariff rate reduction.
Part 5 (initiation and conduct of a bilateral safeguarding investigation) provides for the TRA to conduct bilateral safeguarding investigations to consider whether to recommend to the Secretary of State the imposition of provisional and/or definitive bilateral safeguarding remedies. For example, the regulations in this Part set out: the requirements for the revision of the scope of a bilateral safeguarding investigation, how the TRA and the Secretary of State will treat confidential information, the conduct of authentication visits and hearings, and the disclosure of information forming the basis of the TRA's determinations.
Part 6 (reviews) provides for the TRA to review existing bilateral safeguarding remedies so as to recommend the maintenance, variation (including extension of duration), revocation or replacement of the relevant remedy.
Part 7 (investigation in light of an international dispute decision) provides for the Secretary of State to direct the TRA to conduct an investigation as to whether a bilateral safeguarding remedy should be maintained, varied or revoked following an international dispute decision, and sets out the powers of the Secretary of State in relation to the TRA’s recommendations.
Part 8 (supplementary) requires the TRA to keep a public file of information relevant to a bilateral safeguarding investigation, international dispute investigation or review, and provides for the TRA to make exceptions to the general application of bilateral safeguarding remedies.
Part 9 (amendment of the Trade Remedies (Reconsideration and Appeals) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019) amends those Regulations to ensure they apply to appeals relating to bilateral safeguarding remedies under the Act and under these Regulations.

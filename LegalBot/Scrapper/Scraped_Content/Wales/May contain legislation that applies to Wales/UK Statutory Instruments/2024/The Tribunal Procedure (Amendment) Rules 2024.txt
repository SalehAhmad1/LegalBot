(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the tribunal procedure rules that apply in some of the chambers of the First-tier Tribunal.
Rule 2 amends the definition of “HMRC” in rule 1(3) (citation, commencement, application and interpretation) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009 (S.I. 2009/273), to include reference to the Gambling Commission exercising functions under Part 3 of the Finance Act 2022 (c. 23). This amendment ensures that these rules of procedure apply to appeals in respect of the exercise of those functions by the Gambling Commission.
Rule 3 amends rule 22(6) (the notice of appeal) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (S.I. 2009/1976) to specify the period by which a notice of appeal, in respect of an appeal under regulation 30(5) or (7) of the Biodiversity Gain Site Register Regulations 2024 (S.I. 2024/45), must be submitted to the Tribunal.
Rule 4(2) amends the definition of “unresponsive grantor cases” in rule 1(3) (citation, commencement and interpretation) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013 (S.I. 2013/1169), to include reference to paragraph 27ZE of Part 4ZA of Schedule 3A to the Communications Act 2003 (c. 21) (“2003 Act”). This amendment allows the Tribunal to dispose of applications made under those provisions of the 2003 Act without a hearing, after giving 14 days’ notice (see rule 31(3)(a) (decision with or without a hearing)). This is in addition to applications made under paragraph 27D of Part 4A (code rights in respect of land connected to leased premises: unresponsive occupiers) of Schedule 3A to the 2003 Act to which rule 31(3)(a) already applies.
Rule 4(3) amends rule 13 (orders for costs, reimbursement of fees and interest on costs) to clarify that the Tribunal may make an order for costs in respect of any proceedings under the 2003 Act, including those proceedings that have been transferred from the Upper Tribunal.
No impact assessment has been carried out for these amendments as no, or no significant impact, on the private, voluntary, or public sectors is foreseen.

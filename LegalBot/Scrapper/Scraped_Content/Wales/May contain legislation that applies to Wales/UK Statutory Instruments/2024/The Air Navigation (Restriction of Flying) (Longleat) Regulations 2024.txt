EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Longleat House, Warminster, 
Wiltshire by the reason of the intended holding there of flying displays scheduled to take place 
from 13th to 15th September 2024, inclusive. 
A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the event and 
therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should 
be restricted in the vicinity of the displays for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(a), the Icons of the Sky flying display 
director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr Alan Frew, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 382734.

Coming into force

An application has been made to the Secretary of State under section 37 (applications for orders granting development consent) of the Planning Act 2008(1) (the “2008 Act”) in accordance with the Infrastructure Planning (Applications: Prescribed Forms and Procedure) Regulations 2009(2) for an Order granting development consent.
The application was examined by a Panel as Examining authority appointed by the Secretary of State pursuant to sections 61(3) and 65(4) of Part 6 of the 2008 Act and carried out in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010(5). The Examining authority having considered the application with the documents that accompanied the application, and the representations made and not withdrawn, has, in accordance with section 74(2)(6) of the 2008 Act, submitted a report and recommendation to the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State having considered the representations made and not withdrawn, the report and recommendation of the Examining authority and having taken into account the environmental information in accordance with regulation 4 of the Infrastructure Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017(7) and having had regard to the documents and matters referred to in section 104(2)(8) (decisions in cases where national policy statement has effect) of the 2008 Act has determined to make an Order granting development consent for the development comprised in the application on terms that, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, are not materially different from those comprised in the application.

(3) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence, without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence, to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(4) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (3), a court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street including the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of that part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given that person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that those instructions had been carried out.Temporary stopping up of streets, public rights of way and access land

25.—(1) Subject to the following paragraphs of this article, the undertaker may acquire such rights over the Order land as may be required for any purpose for which that land may be acquired under article 22 (compulsory acquisition of land), by creating them as well as acquiring rights already in existence.

(3) Where in consequence of paragraph (2), a statutory undertaker exercises the powers in paragraph (1) in place of the undertaker, except in relation to the payment of compensation the liability for which must remain with the undertaker, the statutory undertaker is to be treated for the purposes of this Order, and by any person with an interest in the land affected, as being the undertaker in relation to the acquisition of the rights in question.
(4) In the case of—
(a)
the Order land specified in column (1) of Table 7 in Schedule 7 (land in which new rights etc. may be acquired) and coloured blue on the land plans (the special category land) the undertaker’s powers of compulsory acquisition under paragraph (1) are limited to the acquisition of such wayleaves, easements, new rights over the land or the imposition of such restrictive covenants as the undertaker may require for or in connection with the authorised development for the purposes specified in column (2) of that Table 7 in relation to that land; and

(5) The power under paragraphs (1) and (2) to acquire the rights and to impose the restrictive covenants for the benefit of statutory undertakers—

does not preclude the acquisition of such other rights and the imposition of such other restrictive covenants in respect of the same land as may be required for the benefit of any other statutory undertaker; and
(b)
must not be exercised by the undertaker in a way that precludes the acquisition of such other rights and the imposition of such other restrictive covenants in respect of the same land as are required for the benefit of any other statutory undertaker.

(7) Schedule 8 (modification of compensation and compulsory purchase enactments for creation of new rights and imposition of new restrictive covenants) has effect for the purpose of modifying the enactments relating to compensation and the provisions of the 1965 Act in their application in relation to the compulsory acquisition under this article of a right over land by the creation of a new right or the imposition of a restrictive covenant.
(8) For the purposes of this article and Schedule 7 “statutory undertaker” includes any person who has apparatus within the Order limits.

(11) This article is subject to article 43 (Crown rights).
(12) Subject to Article 43 (Crown rights), so much of the special category land as is required for the purposes of the exercising of rights acquired by the undertaker pursuant to this article is discharged from all rights, trusts and incidents to which it was previously subject, so far as their continuance would be inconsistent with the exercise of those rights.Private rights
26.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this article, all private rights and restrictions over land subject to compulsory acquisition under this Order are extinguished—
(a)
as from the date of acquisition of the land by the undertaker, whether compulsorily or by agreement; or
(b)

the specific person who will be responsible for confirming or refusing the consent or agreement.
(3) Any request for consent under paragraphs 5(1), 6(1) and 6(2) must be accompanied by the information referred to in sub-paragraph (1) as amended or expanded in response to sub-paragraph (2).
(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), where conditions are included in any consent granted by the NZT Undertaker pursuant to this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker must comply with the conditions if it chooses to implement or rely on the consent, unless the conditions are waived or varied in writing by the NZT Undertaker.
(5) Wherever in this Schedule provision is made with respect to the agreement, approval or consent of the NZT Undertaker, that approval or consent must be in writing and subject to such reasonable terms and conditions as the NZT Undertaker may require including conditions requiring protective works to be carried out, but must not be unreasonably refused or delayed and for the purposes of these provisions it will be deemed to be reasonable for any consent to be refused if it would—
(a)
compromise the safety and operational viability of the NZT Project;
(b)
make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive; and/or
(c)
prevent the ability of the NZT Undertaker to have uninterrupted access to the NZT Project,
provided that before the NZT Undertaker can validly refuse consent for any of the reasons set out in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) it must first give the undertaker seven days’ notice of such intention and consider any representations made in respect of such refusal by the undertaker to the NZT Undertaker within that seven day period.
(6) The seven day period referred to in the proviso to sub-paragraph (5) must be added to the period of time within which any request for agreement, approval or consent is required to be responded to pursuant to the provisions of this Schedule.
(7) In the event that—
(a)
the undertaker considers that the NZT Undertaker has unreasonably withheld its authorisation or agreement under paragraphs 5(1), 6(1) and/or 6(2); or
(b)
the undertaker considers that the NZT Undertaker has given its authorisation under paragraphs 5(1), 6(1) and/or 6(2) subject to unreasonable conditions,
the undertaker may refer the matter to an expert for determination under paragraph 11.
(8) Any notice under sub-paragraph (1) and any request for approval or consent under the provisions of this Schedule must be sent to the NZT Undertaker by recorded delivery and addressed to Andy Lane, VP Hydrogen – UK, bp, Chertsey Road, Sunbury on Thames, Middlesex TW16 7LN, and copied to Clare Haley, Senior Counsel, bp, Chertsey Road, Sunbury on Thames, Middlesex TW16 7LN (or the equivalent named individual holding those positions at the time of the notice) and by email to andy.lane@uk.bp.com and clare.haley@uk.bp.com.
(9) In the event that the NZT Undertaker does not respond in writing to a request for approval or consent or agreement within 28 days of its receipt of the postal request then the undertaker may serve upon the NZT Undertaker written notice requiring the NZT Undertaker to give their decision within a further 28 days beginning with the date upon which the NZT Undertaker received written notice from the undertaker and, subject to compliance with sub-paragraph (10), if by the expiry of the further 28 day period the NZT Undertaker has failed to notify the undertaker of its decision the NZT Undertaker is deemed to have given its consent, approval or agreement without any terms or conditions.
(10) Any further notice given by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (9) must include a written statement that the provisions of sub-paragraph (9) apply to the relevant approval or consent or agreement.
Co-operation
4.  Insofar as the NZT Specified Works are or may be undertaken concurrently with the Specified Works within the Shared Area, the undertaker must—
(a)
co-operate with the NZT Undertaker with a view to ensuring—
(i)
the co-ordination of programming of all activities and the carrying out of works within the Shared Area; and
(ii)
that access for the purposes of the construction and operation of the NZT Project is maintained for the NZT Undertaker and its contractors, employees, contractors and sub-contractors; and
(b)
use reasonable endeavours to avoid any conflict arising from the carrying out of the Respective Projects.
Regulation of works within the shared area
5.—(1) The undertaker must not carry out the Specified Works without the prior written consent of the NZT Undertaker obtained pursuant to, and in accordance with, the provisions of paragraph 3.
(2) Where under paragraph 3(5) the NZT Undertaker requires any protective works to be carried out either by themselves or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works must be carried out to the reasonable satisfaction of the NZT Undertaker.
(3) Nothing in paragraph 3 or this paragraph 5 precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 48 days before commencing the execution of any of the Specified Works, new Plans in respect of that Specified Work in substitution of the Plans previously submitted, and the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph 3 shall apply to the new Plans.
(4) Where there has been a reference to an expert in accordance with paragraph 11 and the expert gives approval for the works concerned, the Specified Works must be carried out in accordance with that approval and any conditions applied by the decision of the expert under paragraph 11.
(5) The undertaker must give to the NZT Undertaker not less than 28 days’ written notice of its intention to commence the construction of any of the Specified Works and, not more than 14 days after completion of their construction, must give the NZT Undertaker written notice of the completion.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraphs (1) to (5) above in a case of emergency, (being actions required directly to prevent possible death or injury) but in that case it must give to the NZT Undertaker notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and thereafter must comply with paragraphs 3 and 5 in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) The undertaker must at all reasonable times during construction of the Specified Works allow the NZT Undertaker and its officers, employees, servants, contractors, and agents access to the Specified Works and all reasonable facilities for inspection of the Specified Works.
(8) After the purpose of any temporary works has been accomplished, the undertaker must with all reasonable dispatch, or after a reasonable period of notice in writing from the NZT Undertaker requiring the undertaker to do so, remove the temporary works in, on, under, over, or within the Shared Area.
(9) If the undertaker fails to remove the temporary works within a reasonable period of receipt of a notice pursuant to sub-paragraph (8), the NZT Undertaker may remove the temporary works and may recover the reasonable costs of doing so from the undertaker.
(10) The undertaker must not exercise the powers conferred by the Order or undertake the Specified Works to prevent or interfere with the access by the NZT Undertaker to the NZT Specified Works unless first agreed in writing by the NZT Undertaker.
(11) If in consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by the Order or the carrying out of the Specified Works the access to any of the NZT Specified Works is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to the NZT Specified Works as will enable the NZT Undertaker to construct, maintain or operate the NZT Project no less effectively than was possible before the obstruction.
(12) To ensure its compliance with this paragraph 5, the undertaker must before carrying out any of the Specified Works request up-to-date written confirmation from the NZT Undertaker of the location of any part of its then existing or proposed NZT Specified Works.

(5) Regardless of any provision in the Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker must not appropriate or acquire or take permanent or temporary possession of any land interest held by the NZT Undertaker in any plots shown on the land plans, or appropriate, acquire, extinguish, interfere with or override any easement, other interest or right in such land.
Constructability Principles
7.—(1) The undertaker must (unless otherwise agreed, in an emergency relating to potential death or serious injury, or where it would render the Anglo American Apparatus, the Specified Works, the NZT Specified Works or NZT Apparatus unsafe, or put the undertaker in breach of its statutory duties or in breach of an obligation or requirement of the Order)—
(a)
carry out the Specified Works in such a way that will not prevent or interfere with the continued construction of the NZT Specified Works, or the maintenance or operation of the NZT Apparatus unless the action leading to such prevention or interference has the prior written consent of the NZT Undertaker;
(b)
ensure that works carried out to, or placing of Anglo American Apparatus beneath, roads along which construction or maintenance access is required by the Net Zero Undertaker in respect of any NZT Apparatus will be of adequate specification to bear the loads;
(c)
prior to the carrying out of any of the Specified Works in any part of any Shared Area—
(i)
submit a construction programme and a construction traffic and access management plan in respect of that area to the NZT Undertaker for approval (noting that a single construction traffic and access management plan may be completed for one or more parts of each Shared Area or more than one Shared Area and may be subject to review if agreed between the Parties); and
(ii)
where applicable, confirm to the NZT Undertaker in writing the identity of the client for the purposes of the relevant Construction Design and Management Regulations applicable from time to time;
(d)
at all times construct the Specified Works in compliance with the relevant approved construction traffic and access management plan;

(g)
provide comprehensive, as built, drawings of the Specified Works (including, for the avoidance of doubt, buried pipelines) within three months of the completion of each of the Specified Works;
(h)
other than in respect of land in which the undertaker has a freehold interest, following the completion of each of the Specified Works, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the NZT Undertaker, fully reinstate the affected area (with the exception only of the retention of permanent aspects of the Specified Works) and remove all waste/surplus materials;
(i)
in respect of land in which Anglo American has a freehold interest, following the completion of each of the Specified Works, the area affected must not be left in such a state as to adversely affect the construction, maintenance and operation of the NZT Specified Works; and
(j)
obtain the prior written consent of the NZT Undertaker for the use of any re-cycled aggregate material within the Shared Area.
(2) Any spoil from the NZT Specified Works or the Specified Works (including contaminated material) must be dealt with in accordance with a spoil management plan to be agreed between the Parties in advance of the work by either Party generating such spoil beginning.
(3) In considering a request for any consent under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the NZT Undertaker must not—
(a)
request an additional construction traffic and access management plan or a spoil management plan if such a plan has already been approved pursuant to sub-paragraph (1)(c) (as relevant in respect of a traffic and access management plan) or agreed pursuant to sub-paragraph (2) (in respect of a spoil management plan); and
(b)
refuse consent for reasons which conflict with the contents of documents approved by the NZT Undertaker pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph 8.
Interface Design Process
8.—(1) Prior to the seeking of any consent under this Schedule, the undertaker must, unless the NZT Undertaker has brought forward works in that part of the Shared Area before the undertaker, participate in a design and constructability review for that part of the Shared Area which shall, at a minimum (unless otherwise agreed), include the following matters—

(3) The undertaker must at all times design and construct the Specified Works in compliance with the relevant approved design and constructability review pursuant to sub-paragraph (2).
(4) The undertaker may undertake a single design and constructability review process for one or more parts of the Shared Area and any approved design and constructability review may be amended if agreed by the NZT Undertaker.
(5) In considering any request for consent or approval under this Schedule, the NZT Undertaker must not refuse consent for details that are consistent with those approved under sub-paragraph (2) unless the NZT Undertaker reasonably believes that the relevant agreed design and constructability review is materially out of date or is inapplicable due to a change in either the NZT Project or the Woodsmith Project.

any indirect or consequential loss or loss of profits by the NZT Undertaker.
(3) The NZT Undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise shall be made, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, without first consulting the undertaker and considering its representations.

SCHEDULE 8
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS AND IMPOSITION OF NEW RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation to the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 8 to the Net Zero Teesside Order 2024; and
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 8 to the Net Zero Teesside Order 2024 to acquire an interest in the land, and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land where it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 29 (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965)) to the acquisition of land under article 22 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 25 (compulsory acquisition of rights etc.)—
(a)
with the modification specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restrictive covenant is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 of the 1965 Act there is substituted the following section—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (persons without powers to sell their interests);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are so modified as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to compulsory acquisition under article 22 (compulsory acquisition of land), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry)(2), 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on a specified date)(3), 12 (unauthorised entry)(4) and 13 (refusal to give possession to an acquiring authority)(5) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 (tenants at will etc.)(6) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 29(3) (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965) is also modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act (execution of declaration) as applied by article 27 (application of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981) of the Net Zero Teesside Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 28(3) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the Net Zero Teesside Order 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of three months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.

Precedence of the 1991 Act in respect of apparatus in the streets
3.  This Part does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
4.  Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 13 (temporary stopping up of streets, public rights of way and access land), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
No acquisition etc. except by agreement
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained Apparatus
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (1) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses and costs
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents; or
(b)
any indirect or consequential loss or loss of profits by a utility undertaker.
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(4) A utility undertaker must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 10 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, a utility undertaker must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 10 for claims reasonably incurred by a utility undertaker.
Enactments and agreements
11.  Nothing in this Part affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaking in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

22.—(1) If, in the exercise of powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works comprised in the authorised development in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), secure any necessary consents for the alternative apparatus and afford to National Grid to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 23(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation must not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker.
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to a written diversion agreement having been entered into between the parties and the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
23.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Grid facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Grid.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 30 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator may make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
24.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan of the works to be executed and seek from National Grid details of the underground extent of their electricity tower foundations.
(2) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within (i) 15 metres measured in any direction of any apparatus, or (ii) involve embankment works within 15 metres of any apparatus, the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—

(5) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (6) or (8); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraph (2) or (3) apply, National Grid may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage, for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works executed under sub-paragraph (2) or (3) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (6), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where National Grid requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and National Grid must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 17 to 19, 22 and 23 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 22(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised development, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out “emergency works” as defined in Part 3 of the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and comply with sub-paragraph (12) at all times.
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order, the undertaker must comply with National Grid’s policies for development near overhead lines EN43-8 and HSE’s guidance note 6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Lines”.
Expenses
25.—(1) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Grid and the undertaker and subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised development including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 22(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 30 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
26.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by it) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of National Grid.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid as a consequence of the authorised development or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) unless National Grid fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any part of the authorised development and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by National Grid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of this Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 8 (consent to transfer benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised development yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section 3(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 26.
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability, or compromise or demand is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(5) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 26 applies where it is within National Grid’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Grid’s control. If requested to do so by the undertaker, National Grid must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1).
(6) National Grid must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
Enactments and agreements
27.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between National Grid and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
28.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or National Grid requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 22(2) or National Grid makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 24, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Grid’s undertaking and National Grid must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever National Grid’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
29.  If in consequence of the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.

(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 45 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Gas by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Gas in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Gas any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
41.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by it) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of National Gas, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Gas, or National Gas becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Gas in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Gas for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Gas, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Gas becoming liable to any third party other than arising from any default of National Gas.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Gas on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Gas or in accordance with any requirement of National Gas as a consequence of the authorised development or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (2) unless National Gas fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Gas, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any part of the authorised development and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by National Gas as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of this Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 8 (consent to transfer benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised development yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section 3(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 41.
(4) National Gas must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability, compromise or demand is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(5) National Gas must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 41 applies where it is within National Gas’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Gas’s control. If requested to do so by the undertaker, National Gas must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1).
(6) National Gas must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
Enactments and agreements
42.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between National Gas and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Gas in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
43.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or National Gas requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 37(2) or National Gas makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 39, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Gas’s undertaking and National Gas must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever National Gas’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
44.  If in consequence of the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable National Gas to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
45.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraphs 37(2), 37(4), 38(1) and 39 any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Gas under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Gas, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
Notices
46.  Notwithstanding article 46 (service of notices), any plans submitted to National Gas by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 39 must be submitted using the LSBUD system or such other address as National Gas may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker in writing.

Precedence of the 1991 Act in respect of apparatus in streets
49.  This Part does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and Air Products are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (Street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
50.  Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 13 (temporary stopping up of streets, public rights of way and access land), Air Products is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
No acquisition etc. except by agreement
51.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
52.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that Air Products’ apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part, and any right of Air Products to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of Air Products in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to Air Products written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Air Products reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Air Products the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Air Products must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Air Products and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(5) Air Products must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration), and after the grant to Air Products of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to Air Products that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by Air Products, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Air Products.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
53.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part, the undertaker affords to Air Products facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Air Products or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Air Products than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Air Products as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained Apparatus
54.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 52(2), the undertaker must submit to Air Products a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Air Products for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Air Products is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Air Products under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If Air Products in accordance with sub-paragraph (1) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 47 to 53 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 52(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to Air Products notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses and costs
55.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Air Products the reasonable expenses incurred by it in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 52(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Air Products by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 52(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Air Products in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on Air Products any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
56.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 52(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Air Products, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Air Products, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Air Products in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Air Products for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by Air Products, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Air Products, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) Air Products must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(4) Air Products must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 56 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, Air Products must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 56 for claims reasonably incurred by Air Products.
Enactments and agreements
57.  Nothing in this Part affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Air Products in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to CF Fertilisers written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order CF Fertilisers reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to CF Fertilisers the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, CF Fertilisers must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between CF Fertilisers and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(5) CF Fertilisers must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration), and after the grant to CF Fertilisers of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to CF Fertilisers that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by CF Fertilisers, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of CF Fertilisers.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
76.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part, the undertaker affords to CF Fertilisers facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted—
(a)
upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and CF Fertilisers or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47; and
(b)
in compliance with all health and safety, environmental and regulatory requirements and relevant industry standards.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to CF Fertilisers than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to CF Fertilisers as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained Apparatus
77.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works comprised in the authorised development that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 76(2), the undertaker must submit to CF Fertilisers the works details for the proposed works and such further particulars as CF Fertilisers may, within 28 days from the day on which the works details are submitted under this paragraph, reasonably require.
(2) No works referred to in sub-paragraph (1) are to be commenced until the works details in respect of those works submitted under sub-paragraph (1) have been approved by CF Fertilisers.
(3) Any approval of CF Fertilisers required under sub-paragraph (1) must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed but may be given subject to such reasonable requirements as CF Fertilisers may require to be made for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and CF Fertilisers is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(4) The works referred to in sub-paragraph (1) must be carried out in accordance with the works details approved under sub-paragraph (2) and any requirements imposed on the approval under sub-paragraph (3).
(5) Where there has been a reference to an arbitrator in accordance with paragraph 87 and the arbitrator gives approval for the works details, the works referred to in sub-paragraph (1) must be carried out in accordance with the approval and conditions contained in the decision of the arbitrator under paragraph 87.
(6) If CF Fertilisers in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 76(2).
(7) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(8) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to CF Fertilisers notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Consent under this Part

80.  No works comprising any part of the authorised development which would have an effect on the operation or maintenance of the proposed CF pipeline or access to it are to be commenced until the works details in respect of those works submitted under paragraph 79 have been approved by CF Fertilisers.
81.  Any approval of CF Fertilisers required under paragraph 80 must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed but may be given subject to such reasonable requirements as CF Fertilisers may require to be made for the routing, construction, safety, operational viability and maintenance of the proposed CF pipeline.
82.—(1) The authorised development must be carried out in accordance with the works details approved under paragraph 80 and any requirements imposed on the approval under paragraph 81.

(3) Nothing in paragraphs 79 to 82 precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of paragraphs 79 to 84 apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
Notices
83.  Any notices to be served on CF Fertilisers in accordance with this Part shall be served in writing on the registered company address and on the General Counsel at CF Fertilisers, Ince, Chester, Cheshire CH2 4LB.
Co-operation
84.—(1) This paragraph applies insofar as—
(a)
the construction of the authorised development would have the potential to have an effect on the exercise by CF Fertilisers of its rights in connection with the proposed CF pipeline within the Order limits;
(b)
the construction of the respective authorised developments may be undertaken within the Order limits concurrently; or
(c)
the construction of one of the respective authorised developments would have an effect on the operation or maintenance of the other respective authorised development or access to it.
(2) Where this paragraph applies the undertaker and CF Fertilisers must—
(a)
co-operate with each other with a view to ensuring—
(i)
the compatibility of the respective authorised developments;
(ii)
the co-ordination of construction programming and the carrying out of the respective authorised developments;
(iii)
that access for the purposes of constructing the respective authorised developments is maintained for the undertaker, CF Fertilisers and their respective employees, contractors and sub-contractors;
(iv)
the undertaker and CF Fertilisers have the appropriate risk assessments, method statements (RAMS) and construction design management (CDM) in place and are able to comply with their obligations in this respect; and
(v)
that operation, maintenance and access to the respective authorised developments is maintained for the undertaker and CF Fertilisers;
(b)
use reasonable endeavours to avoid any conflict arising from the carrying out of the respective authorised developments.
Expenses and costs
85.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to CF Fertilisers the reasonable expenses incurred by it in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 76(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part, that value being calculated and agreed after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration) to be necessary,
then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to CF Fertilisers by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess. The provisions of this sub-paragraph (3) shall only apply where the alteration is at the election of CF Fertilisers and not where such change to the existing type, capacity, dimensions or depth is as a result of industry requirements, legislation or environmental or health and safety considerations.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 76(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to CF Fertilisers in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on CF Fertilisers any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
86.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule, any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of CF Fertilisers, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by CF Fertilisers, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by CF Fertilisers in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to CF Fertilisers for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by CF Fertilisers, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of CF Fertilisers, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) CF Fertilisers must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand subject to its obligations in sub-paragraph (4).
(4) If the Undertaker becomes responsible for a claim or demand pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) it must—
(a)
keep CF Fertilisers fully informed of the developments and material elements of the proceedings;
(b)
take account of the views of CF Fertilisers before taking any action in relation to the claim;
(c)
not bring the name of CF Fertilisers or any related company into disrepute and act in an appropriate and professional manner when disputing any claim; and
(d)
not pay or settle such claims without the prior written consent of CF Fertilisers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) CF Fertilisers must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 86 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, CF Fertilisers must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 86 for claims reasonably incurred by CF Fertilisers.

107.  The undertaker must give to Marlow Foods not less than 28 days’ written notice of its intention to commence the construction of any part of the authorised development that uses the existing highway route at Nelson Avenue, Billingham.
Co-operation
108.  Insofar as the construction of any part of the authorised development and access to the Marlow Foods operations would have an effect on each other, the undertaker and Marlow Foods must—
(a)
co-operate with each other with a view to ensuring—
(i)
that access for the purposes of constructing the authorised development is maintained for the undertaker, its employees, contractors and sub-contractors; and
(ii)
that access to the Marlow Foods operations is maintained for Marlow Foods, its employees, contractors and sub-contractors; and
(b)
use reasonable endeavours to avoid any conflict arising from the access to the Marlow Foods operations and the construction of the authorised development.
Indemnity
109.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the use of the highway at Nelson Avenue by the undertaker in connection with the construction of the authorised development, there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Marlow Foods, the undertaker must make reasonable compensation to Marlow Foods for any expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by Marlow Foods, by reason or in consequence of any such interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Marlow Foods, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents; or
(b)
any indirect or consequential loss or loss of profits by Marlow Foods.
(3) Marlow Foods must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(4) Marlow Foods must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 109 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, Marlow Foods must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 109 for claims reasonably incurred by Marlow Foods.
Arbitration
110.  Any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and Marlow Foods under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Marlow Foods, be referred to and settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).

114.  The undertaker must not under the powers of this Order do anything which would result in railway property being incapable of being used or maintained or which would affect the safe running of trains on the railway.
115.—(1) The undertaker must before commencing construction of any specified work supply to Network Rail proper and sufficient plans of that work for the reasonable approval of the engineer and the specified work must not be commenced except in accordance with such plans as have been approved in writing by the engineer or settled by arbitration under article 47 (arbitration).
(2) The approval of the engineer under sub-paragraph (1) must not be unreasonably withheld, and if by the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which such plans have been supplied to Network Rail the engineer has not communicated their disapproval of those plans and the grounds of such disapproval the undertaker may serve upon the engineer written notice requiring the engineer to communicate approval or disapproval within a further period of 28 days beginning with the date upon which the engineer receives written notice from the undertaker. If by the expiry of the further 28 days the engineer has not communicated approval or disapproval, the engineer shall be deemed to have approved the plans as submitted.
(3) If by the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which written notice was served upon the engineer under sub-paragraph (2), Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct any part of a specified work which in the opinion of the engineer will or may affect the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker desires such part of the specified work to be constructed, Network Rail must construct it without unnecessary delay on behalf of and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to be approved or settled under this paragraph, and under the supervision (where appropriate and if given) of the undertaker.
(4) When signifying their approval of the plans the engineer may specify any protective works (whether temporary or permanent) which in the engineer’s reasonable opinion should be carried out before the commencement of the construction of a specified work to ensure the safety or stability of railway property or the continuation of safe and efficient operation of the railways of Network Rail or the services of operators using the same (including any relocation decommissioning and removal of works, apparatus and equipment necessitated by a specified work and the comfort and safety of passengers who may be affected by the specified works), and such protective works as may be reasonably necessary for those purposes must be constructed by Network Rail or by the undertaker, if Network Rail so desires, and such protective works must be carried out at the expense of the undertaker in either case without unnecessary delay and the undertaker must not commence the construction of the specified works until the engineer has notified the undertaker that the protective works have been completed to their reasonable satisfaction.
116.—(1) Any specified work and any protective works to be constructed by virtue of paragraph 114(4) must, when commenced, be constructed—
(a)
without unnecessary delay in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to have been approved or settled under paragraph 114;
(b)
under the supervision (where appropriate and if given) and to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer;
(c)
in such manner as to cause as little damage as is possible to railway property; and
(d)
so far as is reasonably practicable, so as not to interfere with or obstruct the free, uninterrupted and safe use of any railway of Network Rail or the traffic thereon and the use by passengers of railway property.
(2) If any damage to railway property or any such interference or obstruction shall be caused by the carrying out of, or in consequence of the construction of a specified work, the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval, make good such damage and must pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may sustain by reason of any such damage, interference or obstruction.
(3) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of Network Rail or its servants, contractors or agents or any liability on Network Rail with respect of any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of the undertaker or its servants, contractors or agents.
117.  The undertaker must—
(a)
at all times afford reasonable facilities to the engineer for access to a specified work during its construction; and
(b)
supply the engineer with all such information as they may reasonably require with regard to a specified work or the method of constructing it.
118.  Network Rail must at all times afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker and its employees, contractors or agents for access to any works carried out by Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule during their construction and must supply the undertaker with such information as it may reasonably require with regard to such works or the method of constructing them.
119.—(1) If any permanent or temporary alterations or additions to railway property are reasonably necessary in consequence of the construction of a specified work, or during a period of 24 months after the completion of that work in order to ensure the safety of railway property or the continued safe operation of the railway of Network Rail, such alterations or additions may be carried out by Network Rail and if Network Rail gives to the undertaker 56 days’ notice (or in the event of an emergency or safety critical issue such notice as is reasonable in the circumstances) of its intention to carry out such alterations or additions (which must be specified in the notice), the undertaker must pay to Network Rail the reasonable cost of those alterations or additions including, in respect of any such alterations or additions as are to be permanent, a capitalised sum representing the increase of the costs which are expected to be reasonably incurred by Network Rail in maintaining, working and, when necessary, renewing any such alterations or additions.
(2) If during the construction of a specified work by the undertaker, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct that part of the specified work which in the opinion of the engineer is endangering the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker decides that part of the specified work is to be constructed, Network Rail must assume construction of that part of the specified work and the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval of a specified work under paragraph 114, pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may suffer by reason of the execution by Network Rail of that specified work.
(3) The engineer must, in respect of the capitalised sums referred to in this paragraph and paragraph 119(a), provide such details of the formula by which those sums have been calculated as the undertaker may reasonably require.
(4) If the cost of maintaining, working or renewing railway property is reduced in consequence of any such alterations or additions, a capitalised sum representing such saving must be set off against any sum payable by the undertaker to Network Rail under this paragraph.
120.  The undertaker must repay to Network Rail all reasonable fees, costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)
in constructing any part of a specified work on behalf of the undertaker as provided by paragraph 114(3) or in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 114(4) including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signallers, watch persons and other persons whom it shall be reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or from the substitution or diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work.
121.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
“Network Rail’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised development) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 114 for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 114) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 114 has effect subject to the sub-paragraph.
(6) Prior to the commencement of operation of the authorised development the undertaker shall test the use of the authorised development in a manner that shall first have been agreed with Network Rail and if, notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) the testing of the authorised development causes EMI, then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(c)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus or such EMI; and
(d)
The undertaker shall not allow the use or operation of the authorised development in a manner that has caused or will cause EMI until measures have been taken in accordance with this paragraph to prevent EMI occurring.
(8) Where Network Rail approves modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus pursuant to sub-paragraph (5) or (6)—
(a)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail’s apparatus;
(b)
any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus approved pursuant to those sub-paragraphs must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 115.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 124(1) applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses reasonably suffered by Network Rail through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Network Rail’s apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which sub-paragraph (6) applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 119(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph shall be deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
122.—(1) If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.
(2) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (1), on receipt of a notice given by Network Rail pursuant to sub-paragraph (1), the undertaker may respond in writing to Network Rail requesting Network Rail to take the steps as may be reasonably necessary to put the specified work the subject of the notice in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property. If Network Rail agrees to undertake the steps it must give to the undertaker reasonable notice of its intention to carry out such steps, and the undertaker must pay to Network Rail the reasonable cost of doing so.
123.  The undertaker must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Network Rail unless it has first consulted Network Rail and it must comply with Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.
124.  Any additional expenses which Network Rail may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the undertaker, be repaid by the undertaker to Network Rail.
125.—(1) The undertaker must pay to Network Rail all reasonable costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part of this Schedule which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)
by reason of the construction, maintenance or operation of a specified work or the failure thereof it;
(b)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others within the control of the undertaker whilst engaged upon a specified work;
(c)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others within the control of the undertaker whilst accessing to or egressing from the authorised development;
(d)
in respect of any damage caused to or additional maintenance required to railway property or any such interference or obstruction or delay to the operation of the railway as a result of access to or egress from the authorised development by the undertaker or any person in its employ or of its contractors or others within the control of the undertaker; or
(e)
in respect of costs incurred by Network Rail in complying with any railway operational procedure or obtaining any regulatory consents which procedures are required to be followed or consents obtained to facilitate the carrying out or operation of the authorised development
and the undertaker must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or any such failure, act or omission and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision shall not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Network Rail must—
(a)
give the undertaker reasonable written notice of any such claims or demands;
(b)
not make any settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand without the prior consent of the undertaker; and
(c)
take all steps as are within its control and are reasonable in the circumstances to mitigate any liabilities relating to such claims or demands and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 124 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, Network Rail is to provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker is to only be liable under this paragraph 124 for claims reasonably incurred by Network Rail.
(3) In no circumstances is the undertaker liable to Network Rail under sub-paragraph (1) for any indirect or consequential loss or loss of profits, save that the sums payable by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) shall if relevant include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs.
(4) Subject to the terms of any agreement between Network Rail and a train operator regarding the timing or method of payment of the relevant costs in respect of that train operator, Network Rail must promptly pay to each train operator the amount of any sums which Network Rail receives under sub-paragraph (3) which relates to the relevant costs of that train operator.
(5) The obligation under sub-paragraph (3) to pay Network Rail the relevant costs shall, in the event of default, be enforceable directly by any train operator concerned to the extent that such sums would be payable to that operator pursuant to sub-paragraph (4).
(6) In this paragraph—
“the relevant costs” means the costs, direct losses and expenses (including loss of revenue) reasonably incurred by each train operator as a consequence of any specified work including but not limited to any restriction of the use of Network Rail’s railway network as a result of the construction, maintenance or failure of a specified work or any such act or omission as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1); and
“train operator” means any person who is authorised to act as the operator of a train by a licence under section 8 of the Railways Act 1993.
126.  Network Rail must, on receipt of a request from the undertaker, from time to time provide the undertaker free of charge with written estimates of the costs, charges, expenses and other liabilities for which the undertaker is or will become liable pursuant to this Part of this Schedule (including the amount of the relevant costs mentioned in paragraph 124) and with such information as may reasonably enable the undertaker to assess the reasonableness of any such estimate or claim made or to be made pursuant to this Part of this Schedule (including any claim relating to those relevant costs).
127.  In the assessment of any sums payable to Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule there must not be taken into account any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken by or any agreement entered into by Network Rail if that action or agreement was not reasonably necessary and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or increasing the sums so payable.
128.  The undertaker and Network Rail may, subject in the case of Network Rail to compliance with the terms of its network licence, enter into, and carry into effect, agreements for the transfer to the undertaker of—

PART 12
FOR THE PROTECTION OF NORTHERN POWERGRID (NORTHEAST) PLC
132.  For the protection of Northern Powergrid (Northeast) Plc the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Northern Powergrid.
133.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable Northern Powergrid to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in Part 1 of the 1989 Act), belonging to or maintained by Northern Powergrid and includes any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will gives access to Northern Powergrid to such apparatus;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in”, in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land, includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land;
“plan” includes all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably necessary properly and sufficiently to describe the works to be executed and shall include any measures proposed by the undertaker to ensure the grant of sufficient land or rights in land necessary to mitigate the impact of the works on the apparatus; and
“Northern Powergrid” means Northern Powergrid (Northeast) Plc (Company number 02906593) whose registered office is at Lloyds Court, 78 Grey Street, Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE1 6AF.
134.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and Northern Powergrid are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (Street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
135.  Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 13 (temporary stopping up of streets, public rights of way and access land), Northern Powergrid is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
136.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement of Northern Powergrid.
137.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that Northern Powergrid’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of Northern Powergrid to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided pursuant to a completed easement for a tenure no less than exists to the apparatus being relocated or diverted, all to the reasonable satisfaction of Northern Powergrid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to Northern Powergrid written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Northern Powergrid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Northern Powergrid the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Northern Powergrid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably practicable and at the cost of the undertaker (subject to prior approval by the undertaker of its estimate of costs of doing so) use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Northern Powergrid and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 148.
(5) Northern Powergrid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 148, and after the grant to Northern Powergrid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
138.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to Northern Powergrid facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Northern Powergrid or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 148.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Northern Powergrid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Northern Powergrid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
139.—(1) Not less than ninety days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 136(2), the undertaker must submit to Northern Powergrid a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Northern Powergrid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Northern Powergrid is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Northern Powergrid under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of twenty-eight days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If Northern Powergrid in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 131 to 137> apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 136(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than thirty-five days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to Northern Powergrid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
140.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Northern Powergrid the reasonable expenses incurred by Northern Powergrid—
(a)
in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 136(2); and
(b)
in assessing and preparing a design for its apparatus to address and accommodate the proposals of the undertaker whether or not the undertaker proceeds to implement those proposals or alternative or none at all,
provided that if it so prefers Northern Powergrid may abandon apparatus that the undertaker does not seek to remove in accordance with paragraph 136(1) having first decommissioned such apparatus.
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal and for the avoidance of doubt, if the apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule has nil value, no sum will be deducted from the amount payable under sub-paragraph (1).
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 148 to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Northern Powergrid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 136(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Northern Powergrid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Northern Powergrid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course.
141.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 136(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Northern Powergrid, or there is any interruption in any service provided by Northern Powergrid, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Northern Powergrid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Northern Powergrid for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by Northern Powergrid,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Northern Powergrid, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) Northern Powergrid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(4) Northern Powergrid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 140 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, Northern Powergrid must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 140 for claims reasonably incurred by Northern Powergrid.
142.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Northern Powergrid in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
143.  Without prejudice to the generality of the protective provisions in this Part of the Schedule, Northern Powergrid must from time to time submit to the undertaker estimates of reasonable costs and expenses it expects to incur in relation to the implementation of any diversions or relocation of apparatus contemplated under this Part of the Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
in assessing and preparing a design for its apparatus to address and accommodate the proposals of the undertaker under paragraph 139;
(b)
costs incurred in fulfilling its obligations in paragraph 136(3);
(c)
fees incurred in settling and completing and registering any documentation to secure rights for its diverted or relocated apparatus; and
(d)
costs and expenses of contractors required to undertake any works for which Northern Powergrid is responsible and of purchasing the necessary cabling and associated apparatus,
provided that Northern Powergrid must use reasonable endeavours to minimise to a proper and reasonable level any charges, costs, fees and expenses to the extent that they are incurred.
144.  Northern Powergrid and the undertaker must use their reasonable endeavours to agree the amount of any estimates submitted by Northern Powergrid under paragraph 142 within 15 working days following receipt of such estimates by the undertaker. The undertaker must confirm its agreement to the amount of such estimates in writing and must not unreasonably withhold or delay such agreement. If the parties are unable to agree the amount of an estimate, it will be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 148.
145.  Work in relation to which an estimate is submitted must not be commenced by Northern Powergrid until that estimate is agreed with the undertaker in writing and a purchase order up to the value of the approved estimate has been issued by the undertaker to Northern Powergrid and an easement for the routes of the apparatus has been granted to Northern Powergrid pursuant to paragraph 136(1) for the benefit of its statutory undertaking.
146.  If Northern Powergrid at any time becomes aware that an estimate agreed is likely to be exceeded, it must forthwith notify the undertaker and must submit a revised estimate of the relevant costs and expenses to the undertaker for agreement.
147.  Northern Powergrid may from time to time and at least monthly from the date of this Order issue to the undertaker invoices for costs and expenses incurred up to the date of the relevant invoice, for the amount of the relevant estimate agreed. Invoices issued to the undertaker for payment must—
(a)
specify the approved purchase order number; and
(b)
be supported by timesheets and narratives that demonstrate that the work invoiced has been completed in accordance with the agreed estimate.
148.  The undertaker is not responsible for meeting costs or expenses in excess of an agreed estimate, other than where agreed under paragraph 145 above or determined in accordance with paragraph 148.
149.  Any difference under the provisions of this Part of the Schedule, unless otherwise provided for, is to be referred to and settled by a single arbitrator to be agreed between the parties or, failing agreement, to be appointed on the application of either party (after giving notice in writing to the other) by an independent electrical engineer by or on behalf of the President for the time being of the Institute of Engineering and Technology.
150.  Prior to carrying out any works within the Order limits Northern Powergrid must give written notice of the proposed works to the undertaker, such notice to include full details of the location of the proposed works, their anticipated duration, access arrangements, depths of the works, and any other information that may impact upon the works consented by the Order.

(4) The owner or operator in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or determined by an arbitrator under paragraph 226, and after the grant to the owner or operator of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) and after the expiration of any applicable notice period in respect of the works under the Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996, proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under this Part subject to any reasonable directions given to or requirements imposed on that owner or operator by Sembcorp.
(5) Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (4), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the owner or operator in question and Sembcorp that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the owner or operator, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay to an appropriate standard and in a safe manner.
(6) If works are executed by the undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (5), the owner or operator of the apparatus and Sembcorp must be notified of the timing of the works and afforded facilities to watch, monitor and inspect the execution of the works.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (5) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 3,000 millimetres of the apparatus, without the written agreement of Sembcorp, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld.
Alternative apparatus
217.—(1) Where, in accordance with this Part, the undertaker affords to an owner or operator and Sembcorp facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted on such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Sembcorp or in default of agreement determined by arbitration under paragraph 226, such terms to be no less favourable as a whole than the terms and conditions which applied to the apparatus to be removed.
(2) In settling the terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along the authorised development, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised development and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus that may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the undertaker; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the authorised development for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator materially worse than the rights enjoyed by them in respect of the apparatus to be removed, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to the owner or operator and Sembcorp as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Consent under this Part in connection with Sembcorp operations
218.  Before commencing any part of the authorised development which would or may have an effect on the operation or maintenance of the Sembcorp operations or access to them, and in all cases where such works are within 3,000 millimetres of the Sembcorp Protection Corridor, the undertaker must submit to Sembcorp the works details for the proposed works and such further particulars as Sembcorp may, within 30 days from the day on which the works details are submitted under this paragraph, reasonably require.
219.  The works referred to in paragraph 217 must not be commenced until the works details in respect of those works submitted under that paragraph have been approved by Sembcorp.
220.  Any approval of Sembcorp required under paragraph 218 must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed but may be given subject to such reasonable requirements as Sembcorp may require to be made for—
(a)
the continuing safety and operational viability of the Sembcorp operations; and
(b)
the requirement for Sembcorp to have reasonable access to the Sembcorp operations at all times.
221.—(1) The authorised development must be carried out in accordance with the works details approved under paragraph 218 and any requirements imposed on the approval under paragraph 219.
(2) Where there has been a reference to an arbitrator in accordance with paragraph 226 and the arbitrator gives approval for the works details, the authorised development must be carried out in accordance with the approval and conditions contained in the decision of the arbitrator under paragraph 226.
Insurance
222.—(1) Before carrying out any works forming part of the authorised development on any part of the Sembcorp Protection Corridor, the undertaker (or any contractor carrying out such works on behalf of the undertaker) must put in place a policy of insurance with a reputable insurer for a sum not less than such level as may be agreed in writing between the undertaker and Sembcorp, and evidence of that insurance must be provided to Sembcorp on request.
(2) Not less than 90 days before carrying out any works forming part of the authorised development on any part of the Sembcorp Protection Corridor or before proposing to change the terms of the insurance policy, the undertaker must notify Sembcorp of details of the terms or cover of the insurance policy that it proposes to put in place including the proposed level of the cover to be provided.
(3) The undertaker (or any contractor carrying out such works on behalf of the undertaker) must maintain insurance in relation to works or the use of the authorised development affecting the Sembcorp Protection Corridor during the operation of the authorised development at such level as may be agreed in writing between the undertaker and Sembcorp.
(4) Any dispute between the undertaker and Sembcorp regarding the terms, cover or insured level of the insurance policy shall be resolved in accordance with paragraph 226.
Expenses
223.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to the owner or operator in question and Sembcorp (as the case may be) the reasonable expenses incurred by them under this Part in connection with—
(a)
the inspection, removal and relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus or alternative apparatus under any provision of this Part;
(b)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus, or the making safe of any redundant apparatus in consequence of the exercise by the undertaker of any power under this Order;
(c)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the watching, inspection, superintendence and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works in consequence of the exercise by the undertaker of any power under this Order;
(d)
the design, project management, supervision and implementation of works;
(e)
the negotiation and grant of necessary rights for the construction, adjustment, alteration, use, repair, maintenance, renewal, inspection, removal and replacement of alternative apparatus;
(f)
monitoring the effectiveness of any requirements referred to in paragraph 219and the installation of any additional protective measures reasonably required in order to deal with any deficiency in the expected level of protection afforded by those requirements; and
(g)
any other work or thing reasonably required in consequence of the exercise by the undertaker of any power under this Order or by the service by the undertaker of any notice, plan, section or description,
within a reasonable time of being notified by the person in question that it has incurred such expenses, such notification to be provided by the owner or operator or Sembcorp (as the case may be).
(2) Where reasonable and practicable, the person to whom the payment is to be made under this paragraph must notify the undertaker of any anticipated expense as outlined in sub-paragraph (1) and provide an estimate of such costs prior to incurring such expense.
(3) In advance of any payment under sub-paragraph (1) above being made and where reasonably requested by the undertaker, the person to whom the payment is to be made under this paragraph must provide to the undertaker such reasonable evidence of the costs incurred as the undertaker may reasonably request.
(4) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under this Part, that value being calculated after removal.
(5) If in accordance with this Part—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by an arbitrator under paragraph 226 to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the owner or operator in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(6) In determining whether the placing of apparatus of a type or capacity or of particular dimensions or the placing of apparatus at a particular depth, as the case may be, are necessary under sub-paragraph (5), regard must be had to current health and safety requirements, current design standards, relevant good practice and process design specification.
(7) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (5)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(8) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a person in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must, if it confers a financial benefit on that person by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course of that person’s business practice, be reduced by the amount that represents that benefit.
Indemnity
224.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of the authorised development, including without limitation any of the works referred to in paragraph 215 (other than apparatus, the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works), or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to the Sembcorp operations or property of an owner or operator or Sembcorp, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, to or by an owner or operator or Sembcorp, or Sembcorp becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by the owner or operator in question or Sembcorp (as the case may be) in making good such damage or restoring the service, supply and/or operations; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to the owner or operator in question or Sembcorp or to any other person whose supply or operations are affected by the damage or interruption (as the case may be, and in all cases excluding third party owners or operators) for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by that person, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of the person (or its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents) who would but for this sub-paragraph be the beneficiary of the indemnification provisions in the said sub-paragraph (1).
(3) The person to whom the liability is owed under sub-paragraph (1) must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(4) The person to whom the liability is owed under sub-paragraph (1) must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 223 applies where it is within its reasonable ability and control so to do. If requested to do so by the undertaker, the person must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 223 for claims reasonably incurred by the owner or operator in question or by Sembcorp (as the case may be).

(4) The undertaker’s obligations in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) are subject to Sembcorp providing reasonable notice to them of the existence of a relevant consultation group or a relevant community environmental liaison group and reasonable notice of the arrangements for meetings of those groups.
Notice of start and completion of commissioning
226.—(1) Notice of the intended start of commissioning of the authorised development must be given to Sembcorp no later than fourteen days prior to the date that commissioning is started.

The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 267 for claims reasonably incurred by the Teesworks entity.
Provision for diversion works
269.  The undertaker must—
(a)
as soon as reasonably practicable following the grant of the DCO consent, and prior to commencement of the authorised development—
(i)
provide to the Teesworks entity details of its proposed works programme; and
(ii)
provide such further particulars relating to the proposed works as the Teesworks entity may on occasion reasonably request, and must provide the details reasonably available to the undertaker that have been requested by the Teesworks entity within a period of 30 days of a request by the Teesworks entity or such longer period as the Teesworks entity and the undertaker may agree; and
(b)
prior to exercising an identified power in respect of any part of the proposed land issue a works notice to the Teesworks entity for that part.
270.  If the undertaker intends to change the timing of the proposed work as set out in a proposed works programme issued to the Teesworks entity or the timing of the proposed works set out in a work notice the undertaker must notify the Teesworks entity as soon as reasonably practicable and where the undertaker decides to change timing which was specified in a work notice it must issue a revised work notice to the Teesworks entity.
271.  The Teesworks entity may issue a notice (a “diversion notice”) to the undertaker at any time prior to 30 days after the later of—
(a)
the date of issue of the work notice under paragraph 268(b); or
(b)
the date of issue of the most recent work notice under paragraph 269,
unless the Teesworks entity and the undertaker, acting reasonably, agree such longer period prior to the expiry of the relevant 30 day period.
272.  A diversion notice must set out—
(a)
the diversion work proposed; and
(b)
how the diversion work proposed satisfies so far as relevant each part of the diversion condition.
273.  If a diversion notice is issued to the undertaker before the expiry of the period under paragraph 270, the undertaker must notify the Teesworks entity no later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the diversion notice confirming whether the undertaker—
(a)
agrees to diversion work;
(b)
does not agree to the diversion work; or
(c)
requires additional information to consider whether it agrees to the diversion work (an “information notice”).
274.  In making the decision under paragraph 272 the undertaker must act reasonably and may only issue a notice stating that it does not agree to the diversion work where it considers that the diversion condition is not satisfied.
275.  Where the undertaker gives an information notice to the Teesworks entity, that notice must set out what additional information is required by the undertaker to decide whether or not it agrees to the diversion notice.
276.  Where the undertaker notifies the Teesworks entity under paragraph 272(b) that it does not agree to a diversion work, that notice must set out the reasons why the undertaker does not agree that the diversion work satisfies the diversion condition along with an indication of what would be required to make it satisfy the diversion condition.
277.  If the undertaker issues an information notice to the Teesworks entity, the Teesworks entity may submit further information to the undertaker within 30 days of receipt of the information notice.
278.  If the Teesworks entity submits further information to the undertaker within 30 days of receipt of the information notice, the undertaker must consider the further information and paragraph 272 applies again provided that the undertaker is not obliged to consider any further information that is received by the undertaker—
(a)
more than 30 days after the date of the information notice issued by the undertaker under paragraph 272(c); or
(b)
in any case 150 days from the date of the undertaker’s works notice under paragraph 268(b) or if relevant 150 days from the date of any revised works notice issued by the undertaker under paragraph 269.
279.  If the undertaker issues notice to the Teesworks entity under paragraph 272(b) confirming that it does not agree to the diversion notice, the Teesworks entity may submit a further diversion notice to the undertaker to address the undertaker’s reasons for refusal under paragraph 275, provided that the undertaker is not obliged to consider any further diversion notice that is received by the undertaker—
(a)
more than 30 days after the date of the notice issued by the undertaker under paragraph 272(b); or
(b)
in any case 150 days from the date of the undertaker’s works notice under paragraph 268(b) or if relevant 150 days from the date of any further works notice issued by the undertaker under paragraph 269.
280.  If the undertaker issues a notice under paragraph 272(a) the Teesworks entity and the undertaker must use reasonable endeavours to enter into a diversion works agreement within 30 days of the notice on such terms as may be agreed between them, and where a planning permission is still to be obtained for the diversion work, the Teesworks entity must use reasonable endeavours to obtain the planning permission in order that the diversion work can be carried out without delay to the undertakers’ programme for the construction of the authorised development.
281.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if a diversion works agreement is not entered into within the 30 day period set out in paragraph 279 (or such longer period as may be agreed between the parties prior to the expiry of that 30 day period) the Teesworks entity or the undertaker may within 5 days of the end of that period refer the matter to arbitration under paragraph 285.
(2) If a diversion works agreement is not entered into within the 30 day period set out in paragraph 279 (or such longer period as may be agreed between the parties prior to the expiry of that 30 day period) because any planning permission required for the diversion work has still not been obtained, and in the reasonable opinion of the undertaker the planning permission is not likely to be obtained in order to allow the diversion work to be carried out without material delay to the undertaker’s programme, the undertaker may issue a notice to the Teesworks entity confirming that it is not entering into the diversion works agreement.
(3) A notice issued by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) shall have the same effect as a notice issued by the undertaker under paragraph 278.
282.  If a reference is made to arbitration under paragraph 285 the arbitrator must determine whether the terms of the diversion works agreement can reasonably be in accordance with the diversion condition and if it can then the arbitrator must determine the terms of the diversion works agreement and which must be in accordance with the diversion condition.
283.  Where the arbitrator determines that the terms of the diversion works agreement can be in accordance with the diversion condition the Teesworks entity and the undertaker must use best endeavours to enter into the diversion works agreement on the terms determined by the arbitrator within 10 days of the arbitrator’s decision.
284.  If—
(a)
a diversion works agreement is entered into within the 30 day period set out in paragraph 279; or
(b)
a reference to arbitration is made in accordance with paragraph 285 and a diversion works agreement is entered into within the 10 day period in paragraph 282,
the undertaker must not exercise the identified powers in respect of the relevant proposed land.
285.—(1) If—
(a)
no diversion notice is issued by the Teesworks entity to the undertaker before the expiry of the period under paragraph 270;
(b)
a diversion notice is issued by the Teesworks entity to the undertaker, the undertaker issues a notice not agreeing to the diversion work under paragraph 272(b), and no further diversion notice is issued by the Teesworks entity to the undertaker prior to the dates set out in paragraph 278;
(c)
a diversion notice is issued by the Teesworks entity to the undertaker, the undertaker issues an information notice, and no further information is provided by the Teesworks entity to the undertaker prior to the dates set out in paragraph 277;
(d)
paragraph 279 applies and the Teesworks entity and the undertaker do not enter into a diversion works agreement within the 30 day period set out in that paragraph and no reference to arbitration is made prior to the expiry of the period in paragraph 280;
(e)
the arbitrator determines under paragraph 285 that the terms of the diversion works agreement cannot reasonably be in accordance with the diversion condition; or
(f)
paragraph 282 applies and the Teesworks entity has not executed and unconditionally released for completion a diversion works agreement within the 10 day period set out in that paragraph,
the undertaker may exercise the identified powers in respect of the relevant proposed land in order to (as relevant) carry out, use, maintain, operate or decommission the relevant proposed work.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt, in circumstances where paragraph 284 applies, this does not obviate the need for the undertaker to comply with paragraphs 258 to 261A in respect of the relevant proposed work.
Arbitration
286.  Any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and the Teesworks entity under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the Teesworks entity, be referred to and settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
Interpretation
287.  Any reference to the Teesworks entity in this Part means the freehold owner of the relevant part of the Teesworks site.
288.  Where a notice or information is provided by the undertaker to any of STDC, South Tees Developments Limited or Teesworks Limited under this Part, a copy of that notice or information must also be sent to the other parties.

Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on any plan, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement, and before extinguishing any existing rights for NW to use, keep, inspect, renew and maintain its apparatus in the Order land, the undertaker must, with the agreement of NW, create a new right to use, keep, inspect, renew and maintain the apparatus that is reasonably convenient for NW, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
346.  If in consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by the Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed the undertaker shall provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable NW to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
347.  If in consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by the Order, previously unmapped sewers, lateral drains or other apparatus are identified by the undertaker, notification of the location of such assets will immediately be given to NW and afforded the same protection as other NW assets.
348.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if for any reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraphs 341 to 343 any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of NW, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by NW, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by NW in making good any damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to NW for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by NW, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of NW, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) NW must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(4) NW must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 347 applies. If requested to do so by the undertaker, NW must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 347 for claims reasonably incurred by NW.
349.  Any dispute arising between the undertaker and NW under this Part of this Schedule must be referred to and settled by arbitration under article 47 (arbitration).
350.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, the undertaker or NW requires the removal of apparatus or NW makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus, the undertaker must use all reasonable endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of NW’s undertaking and NW must use all reasonable endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) Where the undertaker identifies any apparatus which may belong to or be maintainable by NW but which does not appear on any statutory map kept for the purpose by NW, it shall inform NW of the existence and location of the apparatus as soon as reasonably practicable.
(3) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and NW in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
351.  Prior to carrying out any works within the Order Limits (as defined in the Order) NW must give written notice of the proposed works to the undertaker, such notice to include full details of the location of the proposed works, their anticipated duration, access arrangements, depths of the works, and any other information that may impact upon the works consented by the Order.

354.  Except for paragraphs 354 (apparatus of statutory undertaker in stopped up streets), 358 (retained apparatus: protection), 359 (expenses) and 360 (indemnity), this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and Northern Gas Networks are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus of statutory undertaker in stopped up streets
355.  Notwithstanding the temporary stopping up or diversion of any street under the powers conferred by article 13 (temporary stopping up of streets, public rights of way and access land), Northern Gas Networks is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that street, subject always to the undertaker’s unimpeded ability to carry out the works.
Acquisition of land
356.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus or override any easement or other interest of Northern Gas Networks otherwise than by agreement.
Removal or diversion of apparatus
357.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in land in which the apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part or otherwise, and any right of Northern Gas Networks to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of Northern Gas Networks in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal or diversion of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Northern Gas Networks written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the works and the removal or diversion works proposed, the proposed position of the alternative apparatus, and the proposed timeline for the works. Northern Gas Networks must reasonably approve these details. The undertaker must afford to Northern Gas Networks, to their reasonable satisfaction, the necessary facilities and rights for—
(a)
the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker; and
(b)
the maintenance of that apparatus,
and after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration) and after the grant to Northern Gas Networks of any such facilities and rights, Northern Gas Networks must complete the works and bring the alternative apparatus into operation and subsequently remove any apparatus required to be removed by the undertaker and must use its reasonable endeavours to meet the undertaker’s proposed timeline, and in any event must do so without undue delay, in accordance with the details provided by the undertaker under this sub-paragraph or as otherwise reasonably agreed by the undertaker.
(3) If, in consequence of the works carried out by the undertaker, Northern Gas Networks reasonably needs to remove or divert any of its apparatus, it must without undue delay give the undertaker written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, the proposed position of the alternative apparatus and the proposed timeline for the works. The undertaker must reasonably approve these details and must afford to Northern Gas Networks, to their reasonable satisfaction, the necessary facilities and rights for—
(a)
the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker; and
(b)
the maintenance of that apparatus,
and after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration) and after the grant to Northern Gas Networks of any such facilities and rights, Northern Gas Networks must complete the works and bring the alternative apparatus into operation and subsequently remove any apparatus required to be removed by the undertaker without undue delay and in accordance with the approved details and timeline.
(4) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Northern Gas Networks must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances (at the Undertaker’s expense) to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(5) Paragraphs 359 (expenses) and 360 (indemnity) of this Part of this Schedule apply to removal or diversions works under this paragraph 356, subject to Northern Gas Networks providing to the undertaker in advance and in writing (to the extent practicable) a reasonable cost estimate for works that it proposes to carry out.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
358.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part, the undertaker affords to Northern Gas Networks facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Northern Gas Networks or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus in the land of the undertaker, and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Northern Gas Networks than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed (as agreed between the undertaker and Northern Gas Networks, or failing agreement, in the opinion of the arbitrator), then the undertaker and Northern Gas Networks must agree appropriate compensation for the extent to which the new facilities and rights render Northern Gas Networks less able to effectively carry out its undertaking or require it to do so at greater cost. If the amount of compensation cannot be agreed, the matter must be settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration) and the arbitrator must make provision for the payment of appropriate compensation by the undertaker to Northern Gas Networks as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection
359.—(1) Not less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works that will or may be situated on, over, under or within 15 metres measured in any direction of any apparatus, or (wherever situated) impose any load directly upon any apparatus or involve embankment works within 15 metres of any apparatus, the removal or diversion of which apparatus has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 356(2) or otherwise or by Northern Gas Networks under paragraph 356(3), the undertaker must submit to Northern Gas Networks a plan showing the works and the apparatus.

(4) Any approval of Northern Gas Networks undertaker required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (5) or (7); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) In relation to works to which sub-paragraph (1) applies, Northern Gas Networks may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its system against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works executed under this Order to which this paragraph 358 applies must be executed only in accordance with the relevant plan, notified under sub-paragraph (1) and approved (with conditions, if applicable) under sub-paragraph (4), as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Northern Gas Networks. Northern Gas Networks is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Northern Gas Networks requires any protective works or subsidence monitoring to be carried out either by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature), Northern Gas Networks must give the undertaker notice of such requirement in its approval under sub-paragraph (3), and—
(a)
such protective works must be carried out to Northern Gas Networks’ reasonable satisfaction prior to the carrying out of the relevant part of the works;

the apparatus which is to be subject to such monitoring;
(ii)
the extent of land to be monitored;
(iii)
the manner in which ground levels are to be monitored;
(iv)
the timescales of any monitoring activities; and
(v)
the extent of ground subsidence which, if exceeded, must require the undertaker to submit for Northern Gas Networks’ approval a ground subsidence mitigation scheme in respect of such subsidence; and
(c)
if a subsidence mitigation scheme is required, it must be carried out as approved (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
(8) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of the relevant works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(9) The Undertaker must not be required to comply with sub-paragraphs (1) or (2) in the case of emergency but in that case it must give to Northern Gas Networks notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works shall comply with the other requirements in this paragraph insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances, provided that it always complies with sub-paragraph (10).
(10) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order that may or will affect the apparatus, the Undertaker must comply with the Statutory undertaker’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus including the “Specification for safe working in the vicinity of Northern Gas Networks, Gas pipelines and associated installation requirements for third parties “NGN/SPSSW22” and the Health and Safety Executive guidance document “HS(G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
Expenses
360.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Northern Gas Networks the charges, costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Northern Gas Networks in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal or diversion, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be reasonably required and necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works as are required and approved under this Part, including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred or compensation properly paid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus, including without limitation in the event that the Statutory Undertaker elects to use compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under 356(4);

(2) Northern Gas Networks must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part, and in any event to minimise, any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties capable of being claimed under sub-paragraph (1). If requested to do so by the undertaker, Northern Gas Networks must provide an explanation of how the claimed expenses have been minimised or details to substantiate the cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable to pay expenses that have been reasonably incurred by Northern Gas Networks.
(3) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal and not including the costs (if any) of disposing that apparatus.
(4) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
then, if this incurs greater expense than would have been incurred by a like-for-like (or as close as practicable to like-for like) replacement at the same depth, the undertaker shall not be liable for this additional expense.
(5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4) an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus shall not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to and approved under this Part.
(6) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Northern Gas Networks in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on Northern Gas Networks any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
361.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (4), and without detracting from paragraph 359 above, if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works referred to and approved under this Part, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Northern Gas Networks, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Northern Gas Networks, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Northern Gas Networks in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Northern Gas Networks for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Northern Gas Networks on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Northern Gas Networks or in accordance with any requirement of Northern Gas Networks as a consequence of the authorised development or under its supervision shall not (subject to sub-paragraph (4)), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (2) unless Northern Gas Networks fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Northern Gas Networks must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part, and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, penalties etc. capable of being claimed under sub-paragraph (1). If requested to do so by the undertaker, Northern Gas Networks must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised or details to substantiate any cost or compensation claimed pursuant to sub-paragraph (1). The undertaker shall only be liable under this paragraph 360 for claims reasonably incurred by Northern Gas Networks.
(4) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker with respect to—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Northern Gas Networks, its officers, employees, servants, contractors or agents; or
(b)
any indirect or consequential loss or loss of profits by the Statutory Undertaker
(5) Northern Gas Networks must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise shall be made without the consent of the undertaker (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Enactments and agreements

366.  Nothing in this Schedule shall require the undertaker to carry out works, or requires the undertaker to enable Northern Gas Networks to carry out works, that are not authorised by the Order. Northern Gas Networks must not request any alteration, diversion, protective work or any other work which is not authorised to be carried out under this Order (but for the avoidance of doubt, it may elect to carry out such works itself under any other planning permission, permitted development rights or statutory powers (including those of compulsory acquisition) available to it).
Cathodic protection testing
367.  Where in the reasonable opinion of either party—
(a)
the authorised development might interfere with the existing cathodic protection forming part of the apparatus; or
(b)
the apparatus might interfere with the proposed or existing cathodic protection forming part of the authorised development,

(a)
with respect to relevant works package A, the approval principles set out at paragraphs 390 to 394 of this Part; and
(b)
with respect to relevant works package B, with the approval principles set out at paragraphs 395 and 396 of this Part.
Approval Principles: Relevant Works Package A
391.  Where the NSMP entity can reasonably demonstrate that any part of the relevant works package A will materially adversely affect the uninterrupted and unimpeded operation, safety and maintenance of, or access to, the NSMP operations it is entitled to withhold its authorisation until the undertaker can demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the NSMP entity that such part of relevant works package A will not materially adversely affect the uninterrupted and unimpeded operation, safety and maintenance of, or access to, the NSMP operations, having regard to the measures of any approved or proposed traffic management plan. A material adverse effect includes any impediment, diminution, restriction or interruption on the NSMP entity’s access to the access road which runs across plots 108, 103 and 106.
392.  Subject to paragraph 393, below, it shall be reasonable for the NSMP entity to withhold approval to any works comprised in relevant works package A—
(a)
which shall include physical works on, depositing of materials on or stopping up of plots 108, 103 and 106 but not the passage of reasonable construction traffic over these plots (which shall be subject to any approved traffic management plan or any traffic management plan submitted as part of the design package);
(b)
which involve any resurfacing or redevelopment of the access road between the TGLP freehold and Seal Sands Road and the continuation of that access road within the TGLP freehold unless a working method has been submitted and approved by the NSMP entity which amongst any other requirements of the NSMP entity demonstrates access will be continuously maintained and will be no less convenient for the NSMP entity;
(c)
which require access for construction traffic over the access road between the TGLP freehold and Seal Sands Road and the continuation of that access road within the TGLP freehold, other than—
(i)
over plots 98, 108, 103, 105 and 106 as strictly required for construction of Work Number 2A within plot 105; or
(ii)
over plots 98, 108 and 103 as strictly required for the implementation of Work Numbers 2 and 10 on plots 110, 112, 113 and 114,
in each case subject to the approved traffic management plan or any proposed traffic management plan submitted as part of the relevant design package;
(d)
which include any construction or laydown area on the TGLP freehold, other than a temporary laydown area within plot 105 for materials required for the construction of Work Number 2A within plot 105; or
(e)
which requires the stopping up of Seal Sands Road or the private road (parts of which runs through plots 103, 106 and 108) either temporarily or permanently.
393.  It will be unreasonable for the NSMP entity to withhold approval under sub-paragraphs 391(a) and (c), on grounds relating to access to the NSMP operations (as required under the NSMP requirements) if the design package submitted demonstrates that relevant works package A will be undertaken in accordance with any approved traffic management plan.
394.  The undertaker and the NSMP entity must, in carrying out their obligations in relation to the traffic management plan and approval of the design package for relevant works package A—
(a)
co-operate with each other with a view to ensuring—
(i)
the compatibility of the authorised development and the NSMP operations;
(ii)
the co-ordination of the construction programming of the authorised development and the NSMP operations; and
(iii)
the achievement of the NSMP requirements; and
(b)
use reasonable endeavours to avoid any conflict arising from the carrying out of the authorised development and the NSMP operations, having regard always to the NSMP requirements.
Approval Principles: Relevant Works Package B
395.  It shall be reasonable for the NSMP entity to withhold approval to any works comprised in relevant works package B, or to impose conditions on any approval having regard to the requirement for—
(a)
uninterrupted and unimpeded emergency access with or without vehicles to the NSMP operations at all times; and
(b)
reasonable access with or without vehicles to inspect, repair, replace and maintain and ensure the continuing safety and operation or viability of the NSMP operations.
396.  The undertaker and the NSMP entity must, in carrying out their obligations in relation to the approval of the design package for relevant works package B—
(a)
co-operate with each other with a view to ensuring—
(i)
the compatibility of the authorised development and the NSMP operations; and
(ii)
the co-ordination of the construction programming of the authorised development and the NSMP operations; and
(b)
use reasonable endeavours to avoid any conflict arising from the carrying out of the authorised development and the NSMP operations, having regard always to the approval principles in paragraph 395.
Compliance with requirements, etc. applying to the NSMP operations
397.  If any circumstance arises resulting from relevant works package A which causes any interruption to the operation or maintenance of or access to the NSMP operations or damage to the NSMP property the undertaker shall procure its immediate remediation.
398.  In undertaking any works in relation to the NSMP operations or exercising any rights relating to or affecting the NSMP operations, the undertaker must comply with such conditions, requirements or regulations relating to uninterrupted operation and access, health, safety, security and welfare as are operated in relation to access to or activities in the NSMP operations, provided the same are provided to the undertaker prior to approval of the design package.
399.  For the benefit of NSMP, the undertaker must not exercise the powers granted under this Order so as to hinder or prevent access via the access road between the TGLP freehold and Seal Sands Road and the continuation of that access road within the TGLP freehold other than as expressly provided for in an approved traffic management plan or approved design package.
Indemnity
400.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 375 any damage is caused to NSMP operations or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by the NSMP entity, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by the NSMP entity in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to the NSMP entity for any other expenses, loss, damage, penalty or costs incurred by the NSMP entity, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of the NSMP entity or its agents.
(3) The NSMP entity must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker, which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(4) The NSMP entity must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph 400 applies.
Arbitration
401.  Any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and the NSMP entity under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the NSMP entity, be referred to and settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
Access to plots 110, 112, 113 or 114
402.  The undertaker must not use plots 105 or 106 to access plots 110, 112, 113 or 114.
403.  The undertaker must not use plots 103 or 108 to access plots 110, 112, 113 or 114 if an alternate access agreement has been concluded.
404.  Where an alternate access agreement has been concluded, reference to plots 110, 112, 113 and 114 in the definitions of “relevant works package A” and “traffic management plan” is taken to be deleted.

(e)
the appointed person must make his decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 30 working days of the deadline for the receipt of counter-submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (d); and
(f)
the appointment of the person pursuant to paragraph (b) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(3) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable the appointed person to consider the appeal the appointed person must, within five working days of the appointed person’s appointment, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required.
(4) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) must be provided by the relevant party to the appeal to the appointed person and the other appeal parties on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day.

The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) does not affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.
(10) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (11) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(11) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to the advice on planning appeals and the award costs published on 3 March 2014 by what was then the Department for Communities and Local Government or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

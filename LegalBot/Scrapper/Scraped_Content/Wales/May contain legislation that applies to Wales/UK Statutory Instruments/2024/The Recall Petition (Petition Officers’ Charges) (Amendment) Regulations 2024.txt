17th April 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Recall Petitions (Petition Offices’ Charges) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 2024/298) (“the 2024 Regulations”).
The 2024 Regulations prescribe the maximum amounts which a petition officer may recover in respect of a recall petition under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 (“the Act”). Schedule 2 to the 2024 Regulations specifies maximum recoverable amounts for petition officers for particular forms of expense incurred.
These Regulations amend the 2024 Regulations by substituting a row in Schedule 2 of the 2024 Regulations to include words initially omitted from that table in error. This additional wording clarifies that the maximum recoverable amount in respect of “Renting, heating, lighting and cleaning any building or room” is per designated signing place.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

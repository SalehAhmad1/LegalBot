(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend existing legislation which exempts the establishment, installation and use of certain wireless telegraphy stations or apparatus, known as “mobile repeaters”, which comply with certain terms, provisions and limitations, from the requirement to be licensed under section 8(1) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (c. 36). Specifically, these Regulations amend the Wireless Telegraphy (Mobile Repeater) (Exemption) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/595) (the “2022 Regulations”).
The mobile repeaters that are exempted by the 2022 Regulations from the requirement to be licensed are those used indoors and those which are used in motor vehicles.
Regulation 2(2) amends the terms, provisions and limitations relating to mobile repeaters which are used in motor vehicles. It requires such repeaters to comply with technical specifications and conditions set out in an updated interface requirement published by the Office of Communications (“Ofcom”) in February 2024 (the “Updated Interface Requirements”). The Updated Interface Requirements are published by Ofcom and available to the public on its official website at https://www.ofcom.org.uk/ and from its library at Riverside House, 2a Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 9HA. The Updated Interface Requirements allow the amplification of additional frequencies (703-733 MHz or 832-862 MHz) and set out the rules (including power limits) applicable to their amplification. The omission of regulation 18(2) of the 2022 Regulations by Regulation 2(4) also makes the terms, provisions and limitations relating to such mobile repeaters technology neutral.
Regulations 2(3) and (4) amend the terms, provisions and limitations relating to mobile repeaters which are used indoors. Specifically, they remove the requirement for such repeaters to also repeat a 2G or 3G frequency if they are repeating a 4G frequency (and make associated consequential amendments).
A full regulatory impact assessment of the effect of these Regulations is available to the public from Ofcom’s website at http://www.ofcom.org.uk or from the Ofcom library at Riverside House, 2a Southwark Bridge Road, London SE1 9HA. Copies of this assessment have also been placed in the library of the House of Commons.

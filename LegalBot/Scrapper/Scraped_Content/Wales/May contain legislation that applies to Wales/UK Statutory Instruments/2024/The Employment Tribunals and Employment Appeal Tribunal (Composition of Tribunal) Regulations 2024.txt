26th January 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
Section 35 of the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (c. 35) (the 2022 Act) substituted sections 4 and 28 of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996 (c. 17) (the 1996 Act) so as to make the Lord Chancellor responsible for the composition of an employment tribunal and of the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT). Section 35 of the 2022 Act was commenced via commencement regulations (the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (Commencement No. 4) Regulations 2023 S.I. 2023 No. 1194) made before this instrument was laid and coming into force the day after they were made. Previously the composition was determined by the President or Vice President of Employment Tribunals or a Regional Employment Judge in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State for Business and Trade under section 1(1) of the 1996 Act in the case of the employment tribunal, and by a judge of the EAT under section 28 of the 1996 Act in the case of the EAT. Sections 4(7) and 28(6) of the 1996 Act as substituted by the 2022 Act allow the power to determine the composition of the employment tribunal and the EAT to be delegated by the Lord Chancellor to the Senior President of Tribunals (SPT) or the President of Employment Tribunals (in the case of the employment tribunals); or to the SPT or the President of the Appeal Tribunal in the case of the EAT.
These Regulations implement the new sections 4 and 28 of the 1996 Act by making provision, in relation to matters that fall to be decided by the employment tribunals or by the EAT, for the SPT to determine in a direction the number of members of the tribunal who are to decide the matter (regulations 3 and 4). Regulation 5 provides that where a matter is decided by a single member, that member must be an Employment Judge for an employment tribunal or for the EAT a judge of that tribunal. Regulation 6 provides that (in both the employment tribunals and the EAT) where the tribunal consists of two or more members, at least one member must be a judge, but whether the other members are to be judges or non-judicial members is to be decided in by the SPT in a direction. Regulation 6(3) allows the SPT to determine in a direction whether non-judicial members of the employment tribunals and of the EAT must have any qualifications and, if so, what those qualifications must be. Regulation 6(4) and (5) provides for the SPT to select a presiding member to chair tribunals, and for that presiding member to have a casting vote.
Under the Employment Appeal Tribunal Rules (S.I. 1993 No. 2854) (the 1993 rules) and the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013 No. 1237) (the 2013 regulations), certain matters as to the composition of the tribunal were prescribed. Regulation 7 amends the 1993 rules so as to omit matters that conflict with the new arrangements under new section 28(3) of the 1996 Act in relation to the EAT. Regulation 8 does the same in relation to the 2013 regulations as a consequence of new section 4(4) of the 1996 Act, which makes equivalent provision in respect of the employment tribunals.
To ensure that there is no gap between the old and new regimes, regulation 9 makes transitional and saving provision to ensure that the current regime in relation to employment tribunal and EAT composition remains until the time when the SPT makes directions under regulations 3(1), 4(2) and 6(1). It makes similar provision to ensure that the amendments to the 1993 rules and the 2013 regulations do not take effect until those same directions are made.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

27th February 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to assimilated law in the field of sea fisheries.
Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/909 and Commission Delegated Decision (EU) 2019/910 together set out the multiannual programme for the collection and management of fisheries data. Regulations 2 and 3 amend those Decisions and extend their application to the end of 2026.
The ‘landing obligation’ (the requirement to land catches of certain fish stocks and count them against quota) is contained in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 and there are four additional assimilated Regulations which specify exemptions from the landing obligation known as the ‘discard plans’. The discard plans are set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1393/2014, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1395/2014, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2238, and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/2239. Regulations 4 to 7 amend the discard plans to remove the expiry date of 31 December 2024 for the exemptions.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

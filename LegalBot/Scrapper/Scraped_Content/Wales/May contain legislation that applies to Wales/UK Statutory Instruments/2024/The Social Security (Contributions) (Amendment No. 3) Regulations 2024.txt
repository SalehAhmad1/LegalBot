At 4.21 p.m. on 7th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/1004) (“the 2001 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(3) inserts a new paragraph (3A) into regulation 7 of the 2001 Regulations to allow an advance payment of earnings made in one tax year to be treated as if it were a payment of earnings made at regular interval; despite the regular interval date falling in another tax year, resulting in the payment being treated as made in another tax year. Regular interval is defined in regulation 1(2) of the 2001 Regulations and only includes intervals in accordance with an express or implied agreement between the employed earner and the secondary contributor, as to the intervals at which payments of earnings normally fall to be made, being intervals of substantially equal length.
Regulation 2(4) inserts new paragraph 21AE into Schedule 4 to the 2001 Regulations to determine how an employer should treat certain advance payment of earnings for the purposes of paragraphs 6(1)(a), 7(13) and 21A of Schedule 4 and Schedule 4A. Paragraph 6(1)(a) requires an employer to prepare a deductions working sheet for an employee when making a payment of earnings. Paragraph 7(13) requires an employer to record details about every payment of earnings made to the employee in a deductions working sheet. Paragraph 21A sets out requirements for real time returns of information, including the time by which the employer must deliver the information to His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.
Paragraph 21AE provides that, in respect of both the deductions working sheet and returns to HMRC, the employer must treat certain advance payments and the reduced regular interval payment that follows them as a single payment, made on the date that the reduced regular interval payment is made.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared in relation to these changes as they contain no substantive changes to NICs policy.

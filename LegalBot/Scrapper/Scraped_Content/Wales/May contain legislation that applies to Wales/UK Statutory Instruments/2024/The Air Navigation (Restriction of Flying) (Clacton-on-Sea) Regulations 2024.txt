EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex during 
flying displays that are due to take place there on 22nd August 2024 and 23rd August 2024. 
A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and 
therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should 
be restricted in the vicinity of the displays for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(b), the Clacton-on-Sea Airshow flying 
display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr Alan Frew, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 382734.

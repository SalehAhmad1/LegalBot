(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement outstanding amendments to Chapter VI of the Annex to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (“the Convention”), which relates to carriage of cargoes and oil fuels by ships engaged on international voyages.
These Regulations revoke and replace the Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Cargoes) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/336) and, subject to specified exceptions, they apply to all seagoing United Kingdom ships and seagoing non-United Kingdom ships when in United Kingdom waters (regulation 4).
These Regulations implement all amendments to Chapter VI as at the date on which this instrument comes into force. Chapter VI also gives effect to the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code and the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Grain in Bulk (“International Grain Code”), and specifically sub-chapter 1.9 of the Code of Safe Practice for Cargo Stowage and Securing. These Regulations also therefore give effect to the mandatory requirements in those instruments. All future amendments to the provisions of Chapter VI and the International Grain Code will be automatically incorporated into these regulations by way of the ambulatory reference provision (regulation 5) made under the power in section 306A of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.
These Regulations provide for the granting of exemptions (regulation 6), the approval of equivalents (regulation 7) and the granting of approvals (regulation 8).
Part 2 (regulations 9 to 13) makes provision in respect of the requirements applying in relation to ships carrying cargoes (including specific provision in Merchant Shipping Notice 1917(M) and in regulation 10 relating to owners or masters). Regulations 11 and 12 make specific provision in respect of the duties on shippers, forwarders and terminal representatives. Regulation 13 contains power to issue a document of authorisation under the International Grain Code.
Part 3 (regulations 14 to 19) makes provision for control and enforcement. Regulation 14 makes it an offence by the owner and master for a ship to be used in contravention of any of the requirements in, or listed in, these Regulations (including the specific provision in regulation 10 and paragraph 3 of Merchant Shipping Notice 1917(M)). Regulations 15 and 16 make it an offence by shippers and forwarders, and terminal representatives, to contravene the requirements specified in regulations 11 and 12 respectively. Regulation 18 contains power to detain a ship in cases of non-compliance with these Regulations.
Regulation 19 requires the Secretary of State to review the operation and effect of these Regulations and publish a report before the end of the period of five years beginning with the date on which these Regulations come into force and at intervals not exceeding five years after that. Following a review, it will fall to the Secretary of State to consider whether the Regulations should remain as they are, or be amended or revoked. A further instrument would be needed to amend or revoke the Regulations.

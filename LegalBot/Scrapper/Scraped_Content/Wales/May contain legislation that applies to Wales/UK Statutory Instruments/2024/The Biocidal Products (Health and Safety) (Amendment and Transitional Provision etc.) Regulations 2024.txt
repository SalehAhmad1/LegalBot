   (a) assessment of the available human, animal and non-animal data;
   (b) skin corrosion, in vitro testing;
   (c) skin irritation, in vitro testing;
   (d) skin corrosion or irritation, in vivo testing.
Testing of the product or mixture does not need to be conducted if:
   - there are sufficient valid data on each component of the product or mixture to allow its classification in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, and synergistic effects between any of the components are not expected,
   - the product or mixture is a strong acid (pH≤ 2.0) or base (pH≥ 11.5),
     - the product or mixture is spontaneously flammable in air or in contact with water or moisture at room temperature,
   - the product or mixture meets the classification criteria for acute toxicity Category 1 by the dermal route, or
   - an acute toxicity study by the dermal route provides conclusive evidence on skin corrosion or irritation adequate for classification.
   If results from one of the two studies listed in points (b) or (c) in column 1 of this row already allow a conclusive decision on the classification of product or mixture or on the absence of skin irritation potential, the second study does not need to be conducted.
   An in vivo study for skin corrosion or irritation must not be conducted unless the in vitro studies listed in points (b) and (c) in column 1 of this row are not applicable, or the results of these studies are not adequate for classification and risk assessment.
   In vivo studies for skin corrosion or irritation that were initiated before 6th October 2025 will be considered appropriate to address this information requirement only if they lead to a more severe classification than the calculation method of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.”.

   - the product or mixture is spontaneously flammable in air or in contact with water or moisture at room temperature, or
   - the product or mixture meets the classification criteria for skin corrosion leading to its classification as “serious eye damage” Category 1.
   If results from a first in vitro study do not allow a conclusive decision on the classification of the product or mixture or on the absence of eye irritation potential, other in vitro studies for this endpoint must be considered.
   An in vivo study for serious eye damage or eye irritation must not be conducted unless the in vitro studies under point (b) in column 1 of this row are not applicable, or the results obtained from these studies are not adequate for classification and risk assessment.
   In vivo studies for serious eye damage or eye irritation that were initiated before 6th October 2025 will be considered appropriate to address this information requirement only if they lead to a more severe classification than the calculation method of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.”.

   Skin sensitisation.
   The information must allow a conclusion as to whether the substance is a skin sensitiser and whether it can be presumed to have the potential to produce significant sensitisation in humans (Category 1A). The information should be sufficient to perform a risk assessment where required.
   The assessment must comprise the following tiers:
   (a) assessment of the available human, animal and non-animal data;
   (b) skin sensitisation, in vitro testing according to OECD TG 497;
   (c) skin sensitisation in vivo testing. The murine Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) is the first-choice method for in vivo testing. Another skin sensitisation test may only be used in exceptional circumstances. If another skin sensitisation test is used, scientific justification must be provided.
Testing on the product or mixture does not need to be conducted if:
   - there are sufficient valid data available on each component of the product or mixture to allow its classification in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, and synergistic effects between any of the components are not expected,

   - the product or mixture is a strong acid (pH≤ 2.0) or base (pH≥ 11.5), or
   - the product or mixture is spontaneously flammable in air or in contact with water or moisture at room temperature.
   In vitro tests do not need to be conducted if:
   - an in vivo study referred to in point (c) in column 1 of this row is available, or
   - the available in vitro or in chemico test methods of OECD TG 497 are not applicable for the product or mixture or the results obtained from these studies are not adequate for classification and risk assessment.
   An in vivo study for skin sensitisation must not be conducted unless the in vitro or in chemico studies of OECD TG 497 referred to in point (b) in column 1 of this row are not applicable, or the results obtained from these studies are not adequate for classification and risk assessment and the calculation method or bridging principles laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 are not applicable.

   Acute toxicity.
   Classification using the tiered approach to classification of mixtures for acute toxicity in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 is the default approach and should include an assessment of information from in silico approaches.
Testing on the product/mixture does not need to be conducted if:
   - there are valid data available on each of the components in the mixture to allow classification of the mixture according to the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, and synergistic effects between any of the components are not expected.”.

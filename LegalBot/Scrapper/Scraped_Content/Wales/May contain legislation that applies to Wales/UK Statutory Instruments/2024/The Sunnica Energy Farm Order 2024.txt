whichever is the earliest.
(3) Subject to the provisions of this article, all private rights or restrictive covenants over land of which the undertaker takes temporary possession under this Order are suspended and unenforceable, in so far as their continuance would be inconsistent with the purpose for which temporary possession is taken, for as long as the undertaker remains in lawful possession of the land.

SCHEDULE 9
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR THE CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS AND IMPOSITION OF NEW RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or the imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5—
(a)
for the words “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for the words “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date), omit the words after “If—” and substitute—
“(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 9 to the Sunnica Energy Farm Order 2024);
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 9 to the Sunnica Energy Farm Order 2024) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land where it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act to the acquisition of land under article 17 (compulsory acquisition of land) and as modified by article 24 (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965)), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right under article 19 (compulsory acquisition of rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows—
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.   In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (refusal to convey, failure to make title, etc.);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (conveyance of the land or interest);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry)(2) of the 1965 Act is modified to secure that, as from the date on which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to compulsory acquisition under article 17 (compulsory acquisition of land)), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant (which is deemed for this purpose to have been created on the date of service of the notice); and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry)(3), 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date)(4), 12 (unauthorised entry)(5) and 13 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority)(6) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 (tenants at will, etc.)(7) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 24(4) (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965) is so modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A (counter notice requiring purchase of land not in notice to treat) to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 21 (application of the 1981 Act) of the Sunnica Energy Farm Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 22(3) (acquisition of subsoil only) of the Sunnica Energy Farm Order 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil only from this Schedule.
2.   In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.   A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of three months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1)  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of six weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

SCHEDULE 11
ARBITRATION RULES
Commencing an arbitration
1.  The arbitration is deemed to have commenced when a party (“the claimant”) serves a written notice of arbitration on the other party (“the respondent”).
Time periods
2.—(1) All time periods in these arbitration rules are measured in days and include weekends, but not bank or public holidays.
(2) Time periods are calculated from the day after the arbitrator is appointed which is either—
(a)
the date the arbitrator notifies the parties in writing of his/her acceptance of an appointment by agreement of the parties; or
(b)
the date the arbitrator is appointed by the Secretary of State.
Timetable
3.—(1) The timetable for the arbitration is that which is set out in sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) below unless amended in accordance with paragraph 5(3).
(2) Within 14 days of the arbitrator being appointed, the claimant must provide both the respondent and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement of claim which describes the nature of the difference between the parties, the legal and factual issues, the claimant’s contentions as to those issues, the amount of its claim or the remedy it is seeking; and
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of all documents on which it relies, including contractual documentation, correspondence (including electronic documents), legal precedents and expert witness reports.
(3) Within 14 days of receipt of the claimant’s statements under sub-paragraph (2) by the arbitrator and respondent, the respondent must provide the claimant and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement of defence consisting of a response to the claimant’s statement of claim, its statement in respect of the nature of the difference, the legal and factual issues in the claimant’s claim, its acceptance of any elements of the claimant’s claim and its contentions as to those elements of the claimant’s claim it does not accept;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of all documents on which it relies, including contractual documentation, correspondence (including electronic documents), legal precedents and expert witness reports; and
(c)
any objections it wishes to make to the claimant’s statements, comments on the claimant’s expert reports (if submitted by the claimant) and explanations of the objections.
(4) Within seven days of the respondent serving its statements under sub-paragraph (3), the claimant may make a statement of reply by providing both the respondent and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement responding to the respondent’s submissions, including its reply in respect of the nature of the difference, the issues (both factual and legal) and its contentions in relation to the issues;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of documents in response to the respondent’s submissions;
(c)
any expert report in response to the respondent’s submissions;
(d)
any objections to the statements of evidence, expert reports or other documents submitted by the respondent; and
(e)
its written submissions in response to the legal and factual issues involved.
Procedure
4.—(1) The parties’ pleadings, witness statements and expert reports (if any) must be concise. A single pleading must not exceed 30 single-sided A4 pages using 10pt Arial font.
(2) The arbitrator will make an award on the substantive differences based solely on the written material submitted by the parties unless the arbitrator decides that a hearing is necessary to explain or resolve any matters.
(3) Either party may, within two days of delivery of the last submission, request a hearing giving specific reasons why it considers a hearing is required.
(4) Within seven days of receiving the last submission, the arbitrator must notify the parties whether a hearing is to be held and the length of that hearing.
(5) Within 10 days of the arbitrator advising the parties that a hearing is to be held, the date and venue for the hearing are to be fixed by agreement with the parties, save that if there is no agreement the arbitrator must direct a date and venue which the arbitrator considers is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. The date for the hearing must not be less than 35 days from the date of the arbitrator’s direction confirming the date and venue of the hearing.
(6) A decision must be made by the arbitrator on whether there is any need for expert evidence to be submitted orally at the hearing. If oral expert evidence is required by the arbitrator, then any experts attending the hearing may be asked questions by the arbitrator.
(7) There is to be no examination or cross-examination of experts, but the arbitrator must invite the parties to ask questions of the experts by way of clarification of any answers given by the experts in response to the arbitrator’s questions. Prior to the hearing in relation to the experts—
(a)
at least 28 days before a hearing, the arbitrator must provide a list of issues to be addressed by the experts;
(b)
if more than one expert is called, they will jointly confer and produce a joint report or reports within 14 days of the issues being provided; and
(c)
the form and content of a joint report must be as directed by the arbitrator and must be provided at least seven days before the hearing.
(8) Within 14 days of a hearing or a decision by the arbitrator that no hearing is to be held the parties may by way of exchange provide the arbitrator with a final submission in connection with the matters in dispute and any submissions on costs. The arbitrator must take these submissions into account in the award.
(9) The arbitrator may make other directions or rulings as considered appropriate in order to ensure that the parties comply with the timetable and procedures to achieve an award on the substantive difference within four months of the date on which the arbitrator is appointed, unless both parties otherwise agree to an extension to the date for the award.
(10) If a party fails to comply with the timetable, procedure or any other direction then the arbitrator may continue in the absence of a party or submission or document, and may make a decision on the information before the arbitrator attaching the appropriate weight to any evidence submitted beyond any timetable or in breach of any procedure or direction.
(11) The arbitrator’s award must include reasons. The parties must accept that the extent to which reasons are given must be proportionate to the issues in dispute and the time available to the arbitrator to deliver the award.
Arbitrator’s powers
5.—(1) The arbitrator has all the powers of the Arbitration Act 1996, save where modified in this Schedule.
(2) There must be no discovery or disclosure, except that the arbitrator is to have the power to order the parties to produce such documents as are reasonably requested by another party no later than the statement of reply, or by the arbitrator, where the documents are manifestly relevant, specifically identified and the burden of production is not excessive. Any application and orders should be made by way of a Redfern Schedule without any hearing.
(3) Any time limits fixed in accordance with this procedure or by the arbitrator may be varied by agreement between the parties, subject to any such variation being acceptable to and approved by the arbitrator. In the absence of agreement, the arbitrator may vary the timescales or procedure—
(a)
if the arbitrator is satisfied that a variation of any fixed time limit is reasonably necessary to avoid a breach of the rules of natural justice and then; and
(b)
only for such a period that is necessary to achieve fairness between the parties.
(4) On the date the award is made, the arbitrator will notify the parties that the award is completed, signed and dated, and that it will be issued to the parties on receipt of cleared funds for the arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
Costs
6.—(1) The costs of the arbitration must include the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the reasonable fees and expenses of any experts and the reasonable legal and other costs incurred by the parties for the arbitration.
(2) Where the difference involves connected or interrelated issues, the arbitrator must consider the relevant costs collectively.
(3) The final award must fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties are to bear them or in what proportion they are to be borne by the parties.
(4) The arbitrator must award recoverable costs on the general principle that each party should bear its own costs, having regard to all material circumstances, including such matters as exaggerated claims or defences, the degree of success for different elements of the claims, claims that have incurred substantial costs, the conduct of the parties and the degree of success of a party.
Confidentiality
7.—(1) Hearings in this arbitration are to take place in private.
(2) Materials, documents, awards, expert reports and any matters relating to the arbitration are confidential and must not be disclosed to any third party without prior written consent of the other party, save for any application to the courts or where disclosure is required under any legislative or regulatory requirement.Article 39
SCHEDULE 12
PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS
PART 1
FOR THE PROTECTION OF ELECTRICITY, GAS, WATER AND SEWERAGE UNDERTAKERS
1.  For the protection of the utility undertakers referred to in this Part of this Schedule, the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the utility undertakers concerned.
2.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the utility undertaker in question to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means—
(a)
in the case of an electricity undertaker, electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(1)), belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker;

in the case of a gas undertaker, any mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by a gas transporter for the purposes of gas supply;
(c)
in the case of a water undertaker—
(i)
mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker for the purposes of water supply; and
(ii)
any water mains or service pipes (or part of a water main or service pipe) that is the subject of an agreement to adopt made under section 51A of the Water Industry Act 1991;
(d)
in the case of a sewerage undertaker—
(i)
any drain or works vested in the utility undertaker under the Water Industry Act 1991(2); and
(ii)
any sewer which is so vested or is the subject of a notice of intention to adopt given under section 102(4) of that Act or an agreement to adopt made under section 104 of that Act,
and includes a sludge main, disposal main (within the meaning of section 219 of that Act) or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming part of any such sewer, drain or works, and includes any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in”, in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land, includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land; and
“utility undertaker” means—
(a)
any licence holder within the meaning of Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989;
(b)
a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986(3);
(c)
water undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991; and
(d)
a sewerage undertaker within the meaning of Part 1 of the Water Industry Act 1991,
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained.
3.  This part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
4.  Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary closure of public rights of way), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land and Crown land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
11.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaking in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
PART 2
FOR THE PROTECTION OF OPERATORS OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS CODE NETWORKS
12.—(1) For the protection of any operator, the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the operator.
(2) In this Part of this Schedule—

(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the construction or maintenance of any part of the authorised development (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of Cadent or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Cadent and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as Cadent reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent unless otherwise agreed by Cadent, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure or secure the consent to and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised development or maintenance thereof.
(3) The undertaker and Cadent agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus, including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by Cadent and other enactments relied upon by Cadent as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by Cadent under paragraph 38 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) As a condition of an agreement under sub-paragraph (1) that involves de-commissioned apparatus being left in situ the undertaker must accept a surrender of any existing easement or other interest of Cadent in such decommissioned apparatus and release Cadent from all liabilities in respect of such de-commissioned apparatus from the date of such surrender.
(6) Where an undertaker acquires land which is subject to any Cadent right or interest (including, without limitation, easements and agreements relating to rights or other interests) and the provisions of paragraph 36 do not apply, the undertaker must, unless Cadent agrees otherwise—
(a)
retain any notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land; and
(b)
(where no such notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register) include (with its application to register title to the undertaker’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry) a notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land.
Removal of apparatus
36.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, including pursuant to any agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 35, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed and any right of Cadent to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished or interfered with until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and the facilities and rights referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of Cadent and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Cadent advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Cadent reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to Cadent to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 37(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for Cadent to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
37.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 44 of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of Cadent
38.—(1) Not less than 56 days (or such time period as may be agreed in writing between Cadent and the undertaker) before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to Cadent a plan and, if reasonably required by Cadent, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement which describes—
(a)
the exact position of the works;

the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc.;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;

(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any specified works until Cadent has given written approval of the plan so submitted (and the ground monitoring scheme if required).
(4) Any approval of Cadent given under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (6); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and Cadent must meaningfully engage with the undertaker within 28 days of the date of submission of the plan under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)(b) it will be deemed to be reasonable for any approval to be refused if Cadent considers that the specified works would—
(a)
cause interference with or risk of damage to its apparatus; or
(b)
prevent access to its apparatus at any time.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraph (1) or (2) applies, Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plan as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Specified works must only be executed in accordance with—
(a)
the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) (and ground monitoring scheme if required), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent; and
(b)
all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and Cadent is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required.
(9) If Cadent, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 30 to 32 and 35 to 37 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 36(2) and Cadent must give it 56 days’ notice of such works from the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days unless otherwise agreed by Cadent in writing and the undertaker before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development (including such an event attributable to its maintenance)—
(a)
the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme; and
(b)
Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 39.
(12) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(13) In this paragraph, “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to, or to prevent the occurrence of, circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works believes on reasonable grounds to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.
Expenses
39.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Cadent on demand, all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or reasonably incurred by Cadent in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised development including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by Cadent in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including professional fees) incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 36(3) if it elects to do so; or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers under this Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule;
(g)
any watching brief pursuant to paragraph 38(7).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the statutory undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Where anticipated charges, costs or expenses have been paid by the undertaker pursuant to sub-paragraph (1), if the actual charges, costs or expenses incurred by Cadent are less than the amount already paid by the undertaker, Cadent will repay the difference to the undertaker as soon as reasonably practicable.
Indemnity
40.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development (including works carried out under article 15 (protective works to buildings) by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by the undertaker) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)

(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any part of the authorised development or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by Cadent as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 (benefit of order granting development consent) of the 2008 Act or article 32 (consent to transfer the benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any specified works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph are subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph.
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering its representations.
(5) The undertaker must not commence construction (and must not permit the commencement of such construction) of the authorised development on any land owned by Cadent or in respect of which Cadent has an easement or wayleave for its apparatus or any other interest or to carry out any works within 15 metres in any direction of Cadent’s apparatus until the following conditions are satisfied—
(a)
unless and until Cadent is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has first provided the acceptable security (and provided evidence that it will maintain such acceptable security for the construction period of the authorised development referred to in sub-paragraph (5) from the proposed date of commencement of construction of such works to the completion of those works) and Cadent has confirmed the same to the undertaker in writing. The acceptable security is to be released upon completion of the works referred to in sub-paragraph ; and
(b)
unless and until Cadent is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to Cadent that it will maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised development referred to in sub-paragraph (5)) from the proposed date of commencement of construction of such works) and Cadent has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker.
(6) In the event that the undertaker fails to comply with sub-paragraph (5), nothing in this Part of this Schedule is to prevent Cadent from seeking injunctive relief (or any other equitable remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 73 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to NGET or NGT by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.

(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by NGET or NGT (as appropriate) on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by NGET or NGT (as appropriate) or in accordance with any requirement of NGET or NGT (as appropriate) or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless NGET or NGT (as appropriate) fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of NGET or NGT, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any authorised development or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by NGET or NGT as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 32 (consent to transfer the benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised development yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section (b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph; or
(c)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working or business interruption) arising from any such damage or interruption, which is not reasonably foreseeable.

(6) NGET must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within NGET’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of NGET’s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker NGET must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
(7) NGT must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within NGT’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of NGT’s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker NGT must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
Enactments and agreements
70.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between NGET or NGT (or both) and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and NGET or NGT (or both) in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
71.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or NGET or NGT requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 64(2) or NGET or NGT makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 66 or 67, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of NGET or NGT’s undertaking and NGET and NGT must separately use their best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever NGET or NGT’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access

PART 7
FOR THE PROTECTION OF UK POWER NETWORKS LIMITED AND EASTERN POWER NETWORKS PLC
75.  For the protection of the utility undertakers referred to in this Part of this Schedule, the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the utility undertakers concerned.
76.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the utility undertaker in question to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner not less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(5)), belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in” in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land; and
“utility undertaker” means—

UK Power Networks Limited, whose registered office is at Newington House, 237 Southwark Bridge Road, London, SE1 6NP;
(b)
Eastern Power Networks plc, whose registered office is at Newington House, 237 Southwark Bridge Road, London, SE1 6NP,
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained.
77.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
78.  Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary closure of public rights of way), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
79.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land and Crown land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than with the prior written agreement of the utility undertaker.
80.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (6).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the removal of apparatus or construction of alternative apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker if the undertaker is able to do so without unnecessary delay and only in accordance with plans and methodology approved by the utility undertaker, such approval may be subject to such reasonable conditions including but not limited to the undertaker entering into an assets protection agreement with the utility undertaker as the utility undertaker deems necessary. The undertaker must carry out the works under the superintendence subject to the undertaker paying and the undertaker must pay the proper and reasonable fees of the utility undertaker, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker subject to the utility undertaker’s reasonable specification.
81.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
82.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on, over or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are over, under or near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 80, the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 28 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 75 to 81 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 80(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in cases where for the purpose of constructing, operating, maintaining or decommissioning the authorised development the undertaker creates a footpath, footway or other means of access which is to be used for either vehicular or pedestrian access over or under any apparatus.
83.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 80(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type,; and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 80(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven years and six months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
84.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 80(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)

(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 110(1) for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 110(1)) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;

(10) For the purpose of paragraph 115(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph are deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
117.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.

PART 13
FOR THE PROTECTION OF SOUTH STAFFORDSHIRE WATER PLC
Application
151.  For the protection of SSW the following provisions have effect unless otherwise agreed in writing between Sunnica Limited (“Sunnica”) and SSW.
152.  The provisions of Part 1 of Schedule 12 (Protective Provisions for the protection of Water Undertakers, etc.), in so far as they relate to the removal of apparatus, do not apply in relation to apparatus to which this Part of this Schedule applies.
153.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between Sunnica and SSW are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Interpretation
154.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable SSW to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner no less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means—
(i)
mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by SSW for the purposes of water supply;
(ii)
any drain or works vested in SSW under the Water Industry Act 1991; and
(iii)
any sewer which is so vested in SSW or is the subject of a notice of intention to adopt by SSW given under section 102(4) of that Act or an agreement to adopt by SSW made under section 104 of that Act,
and includes a sludge main, disposal main (within the meaning of section 219 of that Act) or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming part of any such sewer, drain or works, and any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus;
“functions” includes powers and duties;

“plans” includes sections, drawings, specifications and method statements; and
“SSW” means South Staffordshire Water Plc and includes its successors in function or any successor in respect of any land interests or any successor as a water undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991.
Acquisition of apparatus
155.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the deposited plans, Sunnica must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Alternative apparatus
156.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, Sunnica acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of SSW to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of SSW.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Sunnica requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to SSW written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) The proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed is subject to approval by SSW (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event that SSW (acting reasonably) considers the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be unsuitable, SSW must (acting reasonably) propose an alternative position for the alternative apparatus and must give Sunnica written notice of such alternative position for the alternative apparatus within 28 days of the service of a notice under sub-paragraph (2). Any dispute regarding the alternative apparatus (including but not limited to the proposed position or the alternative proposed position) which cannot be agreed between the parties is to be determined in accordance with article 38 (arbitration).
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of Sunnica under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between SSW and Sunnica such agreement to be within 28 days of the service of a notice under sub-paragraph (2) (or within 28 days of service of a notice under sub-paragraph (3) where SSW has proposed an alternative position for the alternative apparatus under sub-paragraph (3) which is acceptable to Sunnica) or in default of such agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration).
(5) In any case where alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed under sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order SSW reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus, Sunnica must, subject to sub-paragraph (6), afford to SSW the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of Sunnica and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus and SSW is entitled to recover its reasonable costs incurred in securing such necessary facilities and rights from Sunnica subject to paragraph 159(3) below.
(6) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of Sunnica, or Sunnica is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (5), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, SSW must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Sunnica, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(7) SSW must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration), and after the grant to SSW of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (5) or (6), proceed without unreasonable delay (having regard to the operational requirements of SSW) to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to allow Sunnica to remove any apparatus as required to be removed by Sunnica (acting reasonably) under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule PROVIDED THAT to the extent that any reasonable costs are incurred by SSW as a result of the removal of such apparatus then such reasonable costs are recoverable in full from Sunnica.
(8) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (7), if Sunnica gives notice in writing to SSW that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of Sunnica, that work, instead of being executed by SSW, must be executed by Sunnica without unreasonable delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of SSW.
(9) Nothing in sub-paragraph (8) authorises Sunnica to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 6 metres of the apparatus without the written consent of SSW (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or denied).
(10) In relation to any works which will or may be situated on, over or within 6 metres measured in any direction of any apparatus, the plan to be submitted to SSW under sub-paragraph (1) must be detailed, include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which they are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation and positioning of plant;
(d)
the position of all apparatus including existing apparatus and apparatus to be retained;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to such apparatus; and
(f)
any maintenance required.
157.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Sunnica affords to SSW facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of Sunnica of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Sunnica and SSW or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed within 6 metres of any existing apparatus of SSW, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of SSW for ensuring the protection of the existing apparatus and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with the existing apparatus; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the existing apparatus for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Sunnica in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to SSW than the facilities and rights enjoyed by SSW in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Sunnica to SSW as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Existing apparatus: protection and access
158.—(1) Not less than 42 days before starting the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Sunnica under paragraph 156(2), Sunnica must submit to SSW a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by SSW for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and an officer of SSW is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by SSW under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 28 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If SSW in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by Sunnica, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to Sunnica of that requirement, paragraphs 151 to 157 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by Sunnica under paragraph 156(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Sunnica from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 42 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) Sunnica is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to SSW notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses
159.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Sunnica must repay to SSW the reasonable expenses incurred by SSW in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including reasonable costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any of the authorised works.
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule (other than apparatus that is re-used by SSW acting reasonably as alternative apparatus) is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions except where this has been solely due to using the nearest currently available type; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Sunnica or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the type, capacity, dimensions, or at the existing depth required to maintain the existing operational requirement, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to SSW by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess (save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances (or it would be unlawful due to a statutory or regulatory change) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth).
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to SSW in respect of works under sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on SSW any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Any dispute as to whether a financial benefit is conferred in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or as to the amount of such financial benefit which cannot be agreed is to be determined in accordance with article 38 (arbitration).
Damage to apparatus: costs, losses, etc.
160.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the authorised works any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of SSW or there is any interruption in any service provided or in the supply of any goods by SSW, Sunnica must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by SSW in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to SSW for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by SSW, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on Sunnica with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of SSW, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) SSW must give Sunnica reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of Sunnica (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and in the event of any dispute to be settled by arbitration in accordance with article 38 (arbitration).
Enactments and agreements
161.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Sunnica and SSW in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Sunnica on the date on which this Order is made.

(3) If the provision governing or requiring the application specifies that consultation with a requirement consultee is required, the relevant authority must issue the consultation to the requirement consultee within five business days of receipt of the application, and must notify the undertaker in writing specifying any additional further information requested by the requirement consultee within 14 business days of receipt of the application.
(4) In the event that the relevant authority does not give notification as specified in sub-paragraph (2) or (3) it is to be deemed to have sufficient information to consider the application and is not thereafter entitled to request additional further information without the prior agreement of the undertaker.
Appeals
4.—(1) The undertaker may appeal in the event that—
(a)
the relevant authority refuses (including a deemed refusal pursuant to paragraph 2(4)) an application for any consent, agreement or approval required by an article or requirement included in this Order or grants it subject to conditions;
(b)
on receipt of a request for further information pursuant to paragraph 3 the undertaker considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the relevant authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or
(c)
on receipt of any further information requested, the relevant authority notifies the undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for consideration of the application.
(2) The appeal process is to be as follows—
(a)
any appeal by the undertaker must be made within 42 days of the date of the notice of the decision or determination giving rise to the appeal referred to in sub-paragraph (1);
(b)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the provision of this Order which is the subject of the appeal (together with the undertaker, these are the “appeal parties”);
(c)
as soon as is practicable after receiving the appeal documentation, the Secretary of State must appoint a person to determine the appeal and must forthwith notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for his attention should be sent, the date of such notification being the “start date” for the purposes of this sub-paragraph (2);
(d)
the relevant authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the provision of this Order which is the subject of the appeal must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within 20 business days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(e)
the undertaker must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within 20 business days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph (d) above; and
(f)
the appointed person must make his decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 30 business days of the deadline for the receipt of counter-submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (e).
(3) The appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (2)(c) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(4) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable him to consider the appeal he must, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required and the date by which the information is to be submitted and the appointed person must set the date for the receipt of such further information having regard to the timescales in sub-paragraph (2).
(5) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (4) must be provided by the appeal parties to the appointed person on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of any written representations on the submitted further information to the appointed person within 10 business days of the specified date but otherwise is to be in accordance with the process and time limits set out in sub-paragraphs (2)(d) to (2)(f).
(6) On an appeal under this paragraph, the appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal; or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision or determination of the relevant authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not),
and may deal with the application as if it had been made to him in the first instance.
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits.
(8) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears to him that there is sufficient material to enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case.
(9) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(10) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is to be deemed to be an approval as if it had been given by the relevant authority. The relevant authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.
(11) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (12) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(12) On application by the relevant authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to Planning Practice Guidance: Appeals (March 2014) or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

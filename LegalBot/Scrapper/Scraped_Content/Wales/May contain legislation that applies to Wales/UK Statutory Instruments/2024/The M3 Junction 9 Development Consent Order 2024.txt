S.I. 2007/3372.Construction and maintenance of new, altered or diverted streets and other structures
14.—(1) Any highway (other than a special road or a trunk road) to be constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority in whose area the highway lies and, (subject to paragraph (6)) unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, the highway including any culverts, bunding or other structures laid under it or supporting it must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(2) Where a highway (other than a special road or a trunk road) is altered or diverted under this Order, the altered or diverted part of the highway must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, that part of the highway including any culverts, bunding, or other structures laid under it or supporting it must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion.
(3) Where a footpath, cycle track or bridleway is constructed, altered or diverted under this Order, the constructed, altered or diverted part of the highway must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, that part of the footpath, cycle track or bridleway including any culverts, bunding, or other structures laid under it or supporting it must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from its completion
(4) Where a street which is not and is not intended to be a public highway is constructed, altered or diverted under this Order, the street (or part of the street as the case may be) must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and unless otherwise agreed in writing with the street authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker for a period of 12 months from its completion and at the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the street authority.
(5) Where a highway is de-trunked under this Order—
(a)
section 265(1) (transfer of property and liabilities upon a highway becoming or ceasing to be a trunk road) of the 1980 Act applies in respect of that highway; and
(b)
any alterations to that highway undertaken under powers conferred by this Order prior to and in connection with that de-trunking must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the local highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from the date of de-trunking.
(6) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a special road or a trunk road) over a special road or a trunk road, the highway surface (being those elements over the waterproofing membrane) must from its completion be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority and the structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local highway authority.
(7) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a special road or a trunk road) over another highway which is not a special road or trunk road, both the highway surface and the structure of the bridge must be maintained by and at the expense of the local highway authority from their completion.
(8) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(9) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (8), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.

(b)
they are classified as trunk roads for the purpose of any enactment or instrument which refers to highways classified as trunk roads but does not make provision for highways classified as special roads.
(3) On the date on which the roads described in Part 2 (trunk roads) of Schedule 3 are completed and open for traffic, they are to become trunk roads as if they had become so by virtue of an order under section 10(2)(2) (general provision as to trunk roads) of the 1980 Act specifying that date as the date on which they were to become trunk roads.
(4) On the date on which written confirmation is given by the local highway authority to the undertaker (such confirmation not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) that the roads described in Part 3 (roads to be de-trunked) of Schedule 3 are in a state of repair and condition as is reasonably satisfactory to the local highway authority, the roads described in Part 3 of Schedule 3 are to cease to be trunk roads as if they had ceased to be trunk roads by virtue of an order made under section 10(2) of the 1980 Act specifying that date as the date on which they were to cease to be trunk roads.
(5) On the date on which the roads described in Part 4 (classified roads) of Schedule 3 are completed and open for traffic, they are to become classified roads for the purpose of any enactment or instrument which refers to highways classified as classified roads as if such classification had been made under section 12(3) (general provision as to principal and classified roads) of the 1980 Act.
(6) On and after the date on which the roads described in Part 5 (speed limits) of Schedule 3 are open for traffic, no person is to drive any motor vehicle at a speed exceeding the limit in miles per hour specified in column (3) of that Part along the lengths of road identified in the corresponding row of column (2) of that Part.
(7) On such day as the undertaker may determine, the restrictions specified in column (3) of Part 6 (traffic regulation measures (clearways and prohibitions)) of Schedule 3 are to apply to the lengths of road identified in the corresponding row of column (2) of that Part.

(9) On such day as the undertaker may determine, the orders specified in column (3) of Part 7 (revocations and variations of existing traffic regulation orders) of Schedule 3 are to be varied or revoked as specified in the corresponding row of column (4) of that Part in respect of the lengths of roads specified in the corresponding row of column (2) of that Part.
(10) The application of paragraphs (1) to (8) may be varied or revoked by any instrument made under any enactment which provides for the variation or revocation of such matters, including by an instrument made under the 1984 Act where the matter in question could have been included in an order made under that Act.

(2) Any dispute arising from the making of connections to or the use of a public sewer or drain by the undertaker under paragraph (1) is to be determined as if it were a dispute under section 106(1) (right to communicate with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991.
(3) The undertaker must not discharge any water into any watercourse, public sewer or drain except with the consent of the person to whom it belongs or the person or body otherwise having authority to give such consent; and such consent may be given subject to such terms and conditions as that person may reasonably impose, but must not be unreasonably withheld.
(4) The undertaker must not make any opening into any public sewer or drain except—

1991 c. 57.Protective works to buildings
22.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this article, the undertaker may at its own expense carry out such protective works to any building which may be affected by the authorised development as the undertaker considers necessary or expedient.
(2) Protective works may be carried out—
(a)
at any time before or during the carrying out in the vicinity of the building of any part of the authorised development; or
(b)
after the completion of that part of the authorised development in the vicinity of the building at any time up to the end of the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which that part of the authorised development is first opened for use.
(3) For the purpose of determining how the functions under this article are to be exercised the undertaker may (subject to paragraph (5)) enter and survey any building falling within paragraph (1) and any land within its curtilage.
(4) For the purpose of carrying out protective works to a building under this article the undertaker may (subject to paragraphs (5) and (6))—
(a)
enter the building and any land within its curtilage; and
(b)
where the works cannot be carried out reasonably conveniently without entering land which is adjacent to the building but outside its curtilage, enter the adjacent land (but not any building erected on it).
(5) Before exercising—
(a)
a right under paragraph (1) to carry out protective works to a building;
(b)
a right under paragraph (3) to enter and survey any building and any land within its curtilage;
(c)
a right under paragraph (4)(a) to enter a building and any land within its curtilage; or
(d)
a right under paragraph (4)(b) to enter land,
the undertaker must, except in the case of emergency, serve on the owners and occupiers of the building or land not less than 14 days’ notice of its intention to exercise that right and, in a case falling within sub-paragraph (a) or (c), specifying the protective works proposed to be carried out.
(6) Where a notice is served under paragraph (5)(a), (5)(c) or (5)(d), the owner or occupier of the building or land concerned may, by serving a counter-notice within the period of 10 days beginning with the day on which the notice was served, require the question whether it is necessary or expedient to carry out the protective works or to enter the building or land to be referred to arbitration under article 48 (arbitration).
(7) The undertaker must compensate the owners and occupiers of any building or land in relation to which rights under this article have been exercised for any loss or damage arising to them by reason of the exercise of those rights.
(8) Where—
(a)
protective works are carried out under this article to a building; and
(b)
within the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which the part of the authorised development carried out in the vicinity of the building is first opened for use it appears that the protective works are inadequate to protect the building against damage caused by the carrying out or use of that part of the authorised development,
the undertaker must compensate the owners and occupiers of the building for any loss or damage sustained by them.
(9) Nothing in this article relieves the undertaker from any liability to pay compensation under section 152(1) (compensation in case where no right to claim in nuisance) of the 2008 Act.
(10) Any compensation payable under paragraph (7) or (8) is to be determined, in case of dispute, as if it were a dispute under Part 1 (determination of questions of disputed compensation) of the 1961 Act.
(11) In this article “protective works” in relation to a building means—
(a)
underpinning, strengthening and any other works the purpose of which is to prevent damage which may be caused to the building by the carrying out, maintenance or use of the authorised development; and
(b)
any works the purpose of which is to remedy any damage which has been caused to the building by the carrying out, maintenance or use of the authorised development.

place on, leave on and remove from the land apparatus for use in connection with the survey and investigation of land and making of trial holes or boreholes.
(2) No land may be entered or equipment placed or left on or removed from the land under paragraph (1) unless at least 14 days’ notice has been served on every owner and occupier of the land.
(3) Any person entering land under this article on behalf of the undertaker—
(a)

(2) Where a street is stopped up under article 17 any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, on, over, along or across the street may, and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker must—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the statutory utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in such position as described in sub-paragraph (a).

apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.

an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and

where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.

(7) Paragraphs (3) to (6) do not apply where the authorised development constitutes major highway works, major bridge works or major transport works for the purposes of Part 3 of the 1991 Act, but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of cost of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section; and

the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 6 to the M3 Junction 9 Development Consent Order 2024 (the “2024 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 6 to the 2024 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enter on and take possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 30 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 24 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 27(1) (compulsory acquisition of rights and imposition of restrictive covenants)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restriction, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 24), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A(2) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(3) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(4) (unauthorised entry) and 13(5) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(6) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 30(4) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND NOT IN NOTICE TO TREAT
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or a restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 31 (application of the 1981 Act) of the M3 Junction 9 Development Consent Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 32(3) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the M3 Junction 9 Development Consent Order 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
(3) In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right of the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making the determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawing of the notice.
15.  Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

SCHEDULE 10
PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS
PART 1
FOR THE PROTECTION OF ELECTRICITY, GAS, WATER AND SEWERAGE UNDERTAKERS
1.  For the protection of the utility undertakers referred to in this Part of this Schedule the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the utility undertaker concerned.
2.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the utility undertaker in question to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner no less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means—
(a)
in the case of an electricity undertaker, electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the Electricity Act 1989)(1), belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker;
(b)
in the case of a gas undertaker, any mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986(2) for the purposes of gas supply;
(c)
in the case of a water undertaker, mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker for the purposes of water supply; and
(d)
in the case of a sewerage undertaker—
(i)
any drain or works vested in the utility undertaker under the Water Industry Act 1991(3); and
(ii)
any sewer which is so vested or is the subject of a notice of intention to adopt given under section 102(4)(4) (adoption of sewers and disposal works) of that Act or an agreement to adopt made under section 104 (agreements to adopt sewer, drain or sewage disposal works, at future date) of that Act(5),
and includes a sludge main, disposal main (within the meaning of section 219 (general interpretation) of that Act) or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming part of any such sewer, drain or works, and includes any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in” in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land;
“plan” includes all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably necessary properly and sufficiently to describe the works to be executed; and
“utility undertaker” means—
(a)
any licence holder within the meaning of Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989;
(b)
a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986;
(c)
a water undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991; and
(d)
a sewerage undertaker within the meaning of Part 1 of the Water Industry Act 1991,
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained.
On street apparatus
3.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus in stopped up streets
4.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 17 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access), any utility undertaker whose apparatus is in the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to the utility undertaker legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the utility undertaker in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of the utility undertaker to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 7 or the power of the undertaker to carry out works under paragraph 9.
(2) Regardless of the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under the powers conferred by article 16 (temporary stopping up and restriction of use of streets), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
5.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 22 (protective works to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
Acquisition of land
6.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 48 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
9.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) are to be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker, in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres measured in any direction of any electricity apparatus, the plan to be submitted to the utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) must be detailed, include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which they are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal;
(d)
the position of all electricity apparatus; and
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to such apparatus.
Expenses and costs
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker all expenses reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration) to be necessary then, if such placing involves cost exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 5 or 7(2) any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker and, if such consent is withheld, the undertaker has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Cooperation
12.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or a utility undertaker requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 7(2) or a utility undertaker makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 9, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the utility undertaker’s undertaking and each utility undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
13.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaker in respect of any apparatus in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

(c)
provide up to date official entry copies to SGN within 20 working days of receipt of such up to date official entry copies.
Removal of apparatus
24.—(1) If, in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 23 (acquisition of land) or in any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of SGN to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and the rights and facilities referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of SGN and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to SGN advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order SGN reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to SGN to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 25(1) (facilities and rights for alternative apparatus) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus);
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus); and
(c)
to allow access to that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus).
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, SGN must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for SGN to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between SGN and the undertaker.
(5) SGN must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to SGN of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3) have been afforded to SGN to its satisfaction, then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
25.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for SGN facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and SGN and must be no less favourable on the whole to SGN than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by SGN.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with SGN under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to SGN than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed (in SGN’s opinion) then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 32 (arbitration) and the arbitrator shall make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to SGN as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of SGN
26.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to SGN a plan and, if reasonably required by SGN, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to SGN under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;

(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any specified works until SGN has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of SGN required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (5) or (7); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply, SGN may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Specified works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and (2) as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and SGN and in accordance with all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) and SGN will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where SGN requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to SGN’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If SGN, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) and (6) to (8) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 24(2) (removal of apparatus).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to SGN notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with—
(a)
the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(11) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development the undertaker shall implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that SGN retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 27 (expenses).
Expenses
27.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to SGN on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by SGN in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by SGN in connection with the negotiation or acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including professional fees) incurred by SGN as a consequence of SGN;
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 24(3) if it elects to do so; or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting SGN;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule;
(g)
any watching brief pursuant to paragraph 26(6) (retained apparatus: protection of SGN).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to SGN by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible or appropriate in the circumstances (including due to statutory or regulatory changes) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to SGN in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on SGN any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
28.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of SGN, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by SGN, or SGN becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by SGN in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify SGN for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from SGN, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or SGN becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of SGN.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by SGN on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by SGN or in accordance with any requirement of SGN or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless SGN fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) shall impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of SGN, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any authorised works or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by SGN as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the 2008 Act or article 10 (consent to transfer benefit of Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph 3(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 28.
(4) SGN must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the promoter and considering their representations.
Enactments and agreements
29.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between SGN and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule shall affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and SGN in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
30.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or SGN requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 24(2) (removal of apparatus) or SGN makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 26 (retained apparatus: protection of SGN), the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of SGN’s undertaking and SGN must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever SGN’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
31.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 23(1) (acquisition of land) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by SGN in respect of the apparatus) is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable SGN to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
32.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraphs 24(2) and(4) (removal of apparatus), 25(1) (facilities and rights for alternative apparatus)and paragraph 26 (retained apparatus: protection of SGN) any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and SGN under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and SGN, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 49 (arbitration).

Without limiting paragraph 36, the requirements which the Agency may have under that paragraph may include conditions requiring the undertaker, at its own expense, to construct such protective works, whether temporary or permanent, before or during the construction of the specified works (including the provision of flood banks, walls or embankments or other new works and the strengthening, repair or renewal of existing banks, walls or embankments) as are reasonably necessary—
(a)
to safeguard any drainage work against damage; or
(b)
to secure that its efficiency for flood defence purposes is not impaired and that the risk of flooding is not otherwise increased,
by reason of any specified work.
Timing of works and service of notices
38.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), any specified work, and all protective works required by the Agency under paragraph 37, must be constructed—
(a)
without unreasonable delay in accordance with the plans approved under this Part of this Schedule; and
(b)
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agency,
and the Agency is entitled by its officer to watch and inspect the construction of such works.
(2) The undertaker must give to the Agency not less than 14 days’ notice in writing of its intention to commence construction of any specified work and notice in writing of its completion not later than 7 days after the date on which it is completed.
(3) If the Agency reasonably requires, the undertaker must construct all or part of the protective works so that they are in place prior to the construction of any specified work to which the protective works relate.
Works not in accordance with this Schedule
39.—(1) If any part of a specified work or any protective work required by the Agency is constructed otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of this Part of this Schedule, the Agency may by notice in writing require the undertaker at the undertaker’s own expense to comply with the requirements of this Part of this Schedule or (if the undertaker so elects and the Agency in writing consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to remove, alter or pull down the work and, where removal is required, to restore the site to its former condition to such extent and within such limits as the Agency reasonably requires.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) and paragraph 42 (agency access), if, within a reasonable period, being not less than 28 days beginning with the date when a notice under sub-paragraph (1) is served upon the undertaker the undertaker has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the requirements of the notice and has not subsequently made reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the Agency may execute the works specified in the notice and any reasonable expenditure incurred by the Agency in so doing is recoverable from the undertaker.
(3) In the event of any dispute as to whether sub-paragraph (1) is properly applicable to any work in respect of which notice has been served under that sub-paragraph, or as to the reasonableness of any requirement of such a notice, the Agency must not, except in the case of an emergency, exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (2) until the dispute has been finally determined in accordance with paragraph 45 (disputes).
Maintenance of works
40.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (6) the undertaker must from the commencement of the construction of the specified works maintain in good repair and condition and free from obstruction any drainage work which is situated within the limits of deviation and on land held by the undertaker for the purposes of or in connection with the specified works, whether or not the drainage work is constructed under the powers conferred by this Order or is already in existence.
(2) If any such drainage work which the undertaker is liable to maintain is not maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agency, the Agency may by notice in writing require the undertaker to repair and restore the work, or any part of such work, or (if the undertaker so elects and the Agency in writing consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to remove the work and restore the site to its former condition, to such extent and within such limits as the Agency reasonably requires.
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), and paragraph 42 (agency access), if, within a reasonable period, being not less than 28 days beginning with the date on which a notice in respect of any drainage work is served under sub-paragraph (2) on the undertaker, the undertaker has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the requirements of the notice and has not subsequently made reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the Agency may do what is necessary for such compliance and any reasonable expenditure incurred by the Agency in so doing is recoverable from the undertaker.
(4) If there is any failure by the undertaker to obtain consent or comply with conditions imposed by the Agency in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule the Agency may serve written notice requiring the undertaker to cease all or part of the specified works and on receipt of such notice the undertaker must cease the specified works or part thereof until it has obtained the consent or complied with the condition unless the cessation of the specified works or part thereof would cause greater damage than compliance with the written notice.
(5) In the event of any dispute as to the reasonableness of any requirement of a notice served under sub-paragraph (2), the Agency must not, except in the case of an emergency, exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (3) until the dispute has been finally determined in accordance with paragraph 45 (disputes).
(6) This paragraph does not apply to—
(a)
drainage works which are vested in the Agency, or which the Agency or another person is liable to maintain and is not prevented by the exercise by the undertaker of the powers of the Order from doing so; and
(b)
any obstruction of a drainage work expressly authorised in the approval of specified works plans and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule provided that any obstruction is removed as soon as reasonably practicable.
Remediating impaired drainage work
41.  If by reason of the construction of any specified work or of the failure of any such work, the efficiency of any drainage work for flood defence purposes is impaired, or that drainage work is otherwise damaged, such impairment or damage must be made good by the undertaker to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agency and if the undertaker fails to do so, the Agency may make good the impairment or damage and recover any expenditure incurred by the Agency in so doing from the undertaker.
Agency access
42.  If by reason of construction of the specified work the Agency’s access to flood defences or equipment maintained for flood defence purposes is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access that will allow the Agency to maintain the flood defence or use the equipment no less effectively than was possible before the obstruction within 24 hours or as soon as reasonably practicable of the undertaker becoming aware of such obstruction.
Free passage of fish
43.—(1) The undertaker must take all such measures as may be reasonably practicable to prevent any interruption of the free passage of fish in the fishery during the construction of any specified work.
(2) If by reason of—
(a)
the construction of any specified work; or
(b)
the failure of any such work,
damage to the fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the Agency may serve notice on the undertaker requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage, or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.
(3) Subject to paragraph 42 (agency access), if within such time as may be reasonably practicable for that purpose after the receipt of written notice from the Agency of any damage or expected damage to a fishery, the undertaker fails to take such steps as are described in sub-paragraph (2), the Agency may take those steps and any expenditure incurred by the Agency in so doing is recoverable from the undertaker.
(4) Subject to paragraph 42 (agency access), in any case where immediate action by the Agency is reasonably required in order to secure that the risk of damage to the fishery is avoided or reduced, the Agency may take such steps as are reasonable for the purpose, and may recover from the undertaker any expenditure incurred in so doing provided that notice specifying those steps is served on the undertaker as soon as reasonably practicable after the Agency has taken, or commenced to take, the steps specified in the notice.

(7) The Agency must, at all times, take reasonable steps to prevent and mitigate any such claims, demands, proceedings, costs, damages, expenses or loss.
(8) The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done by the undertaker in accordance with a plan approved by the Agency, or to its satisfaction, or in accordance with any directions or award of an arbitrator, must not relieve the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(9) Nothing in this paragraph imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any costs, charges, expenses, damages, claims, liabilities, demands or losses to the extent that they are attributable to the neglect or default of the Agency, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.

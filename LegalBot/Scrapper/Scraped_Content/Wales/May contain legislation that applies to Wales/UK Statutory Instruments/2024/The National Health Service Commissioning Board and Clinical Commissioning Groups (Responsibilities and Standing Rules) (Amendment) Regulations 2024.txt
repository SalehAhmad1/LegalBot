5th March 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service Commissioning Board and Clinical Commissioning Groups (Responsibilities and Standing Rules) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/2996) (“the Standing Rules”). They are made under the National Health Service Act 2006 (c. 41) (“the 2006 Act”), as amended by the Health and Care Act 2022 (c. 31) (“the 2022 Act”) and they amend the requirements, or ‘standing rules’, imposed on NHS England and integrated care boards. On 1st July 2022, the NHS Commissioning Board was renamed NHS England and integrated care boards became the successors of clinical commissioning groups, in accordance with the 2022 Act.
Regulation 2 amends the Standing Rules as follows:
Paragraphs 2 and 11 relate to and provide for the revocation of Part 10. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”) approved the treatment to which Part 10 refers such that the funding scheme is obsolete.
Paragraph 3 amends regulation 20 to increase the rates for NHS funded nursing care payable by NHS England or an integrated care board.
Paragraph 4 substitutes the definition of “interface services” in regulation 38, to reflect the fact that these types of service may be managed by a range of healthcare professionals, and may be commissioned by an NHS trust or NHS foundation trust pursuant to arrangements under section 65Z5(1) of the 2006 Act.
Paragraph 5 amends regulation 39 which provides for patients to be offered a choice of health service provider, to ensure that such patient choice extends to providers commissioned by NHS trusts or NHS foundation trusts when exercising functions delegated to them by NHS England or an integrated care board.
Paragraph 7 corrects a typographical omission in regulation 42D.
Paragraph 9 substitutes regulations 52 and 53 of the Standing Rules to create a new duty on relevant bodies to make arrangements to ensure that, at the end of each data collection period, the waiting time period to diagnose or rule out cancer did not exceed 28 days in at least 75% of cases where the waiting time period ended in that data collection period (and, in certain circumstances, to offer a patient an alternative healthcare provider). The guidance referred to in new regulations 52(6) and 53(6) is available at https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng12 and https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-cancer-waiting-times-monitoring-dataset-guidance/ or a hard copy can be obtained by writing to the Department of Health and Social Care, 39 Victoria Street, London, SW1H 0EU. Paragraphs 6, 8 and 10 make related provision.
Regulation 3 contains a saving provision in relation to the previous duties to make arrangements to provide an appointment with a specialist, and offer an alternative provider, for those people urgently referred for treatment for suspected cancer before 1st April 2024.
A full impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

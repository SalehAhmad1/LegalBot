26 February 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order is made by the Welsh Ministers and amends the Tertiary Education and Research (Wales) Act 2022 (Commencement No. 2 and Transitory Provision) Order 2023 (“the 2023 Order”).
It omits article 4(d) of the 2023 Order, which would bring into force on 1 April 2024 provisions relating to the associate staff member of the Commission for Tertiary Education and Research. Those provisions are not needed on 1 April 2024 because the Commission will not be substantially staffed on that date.
This Order also omits article 4(e) of the 2023 Order, which brings into force amendments to Schedule 6 to the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 and to regulation 3(4) of the Welsh Language Standards (No. 6) Regulations 2017. Those amendments are consequential on the dissolution of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales. The amendments are not needed on 1 April 2024 because the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales will not have been dissolved on that date.

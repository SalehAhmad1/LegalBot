13th February 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Regulation (EU) 2018/858, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/683 and Commission Regulation (EU)1003/2010.
Regulation 2 updates the table of regulatory acts for GB type-approvals and the table of UN Regulations recognised as equivalent to GB type-approval requirements, to take account of regulatory developments and to reinstate entries omitted in error by the European Commission in Regulation (EU) 2018/858. Regulation 2(4) updates the table of regulatory acts for which a manufacturer may be designated as a technical service, to reinstate an entry omitted in error by the European Commission in Regulation (EU) 2018/858.
Regulation 3 corrects a typographical error in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/683.
Regulation 4 amends Commission Regulation (EU)1003/2010 on the type-approval and mounting of rear registration plate spaces to ensure that compliance with updated EU technical requirements can be accepted as alternative to the GB requirements, for the purposes of GB type-approval.
The UN Regulations are issued by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. Copies of the UN Regulations referred to in these Regulations can be obtained from the UNECE website: http://www.unece.org/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs.html.
The net costs imposed on business, the voluntary sector and the public sector by these Regulations have been assessed as being less than £5m in any year and therefore a full impact assessment has not been prepared.
An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared and is available alongside this instrument at www.legislation.gov.uk, or from the Department for Transport, Great Minster House, 33 Horseferry Road, London, SW1P 4DR.

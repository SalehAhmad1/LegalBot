WHEREAS—
(1)
The London Cemetery Company (“LCC”) was incorporated by an Act of the sixth and seventh years of the reign of His Majesty King William the Fourth, entitled “An Act for establishing Cemeteries for the Interment of the Dead, Northward, Southward, and Eastward of the Metropolis, by a Company to be called “The London Cemetery Company” (“the 1836 Act”) and, under the powers of that Act, purchased lands formerly in the urban district of Saint Pancras, in the county of Middlesex, and now in the London Borough of Camden (“the Borough”) and constructed a cemetery (“the cemetery”) on a portion of the said lands:

The cemetery is situated on that portion of the lands purchased by LCC under the 1836 Act which lies on the east and west sides of Swains Lane in the Borough:

It is expedient that the other provisions contained in this Act should be enacted:
(7)
The objects of this Act cannot be attained without the authority of Parliament:
May it therefore please your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted, by the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—1

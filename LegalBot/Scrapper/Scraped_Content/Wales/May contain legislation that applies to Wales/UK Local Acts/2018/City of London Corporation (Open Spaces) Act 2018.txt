City of London Corporation (Open Spaces) Act 2018
2018 CHAPTER i
An Act to make provision relating to the public open spaces under the management and control of the City of London Corporation; and for related purposes.
[15th March 2018]
WHEREAS—
(1)
A number of open spaces outside of the City of London are vested in the City of London Corporation (“the Corporation”) for the public benefit as places of recreation and enjoyment, and under various Acts the Corporation has powers of management over those open spaces:
(2)
It is expedient to provide certain further powers of management in relation to those open spaces, with a view to clarifying in various respects the powers and duties of the Corporation, more effectually promoting and securing the objects for which the open spaces are held, and enabling revenue to be raised to be applied to those objects:
(3)
It is expedient to provide more effective powers of enforcement against persons who may act unlawfully in them:
(4)
It is expedient that certain of the provisions also be applied to open spaces within the City of London under the management of the Corporation:
(5)
It is expedient that the related provisions in this Act be enacted:
(6)
The objects of this Act cannot be attained without the authority of Parliament:
May it therefore please Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted, by the Queen’s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—1

(b)
the issuing of a fixed penalty notice to that person under section 11,
in relation to that offence.
(2)
A person who, without reasonable excuse, fails to provide information required under subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.13

(b)
sections 101 to 103 of the 1984 Act (which provide for the disposal of a removed vehicle) and any regulations made under them apply in relation to the vehicle as if—

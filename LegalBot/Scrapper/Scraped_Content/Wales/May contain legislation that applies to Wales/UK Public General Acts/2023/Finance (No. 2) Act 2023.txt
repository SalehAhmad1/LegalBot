(b)
immediately before A ceases to live with B, the dwelling-house or part is A’s only or main residence,
(c)
A disposes of, or of an interest in, that dwelling-house or part to B (“the initial disposal”), and
(d)

(2)
If—
(a)
in accordance with the deferred sale agreement or order A receives a sum in respect of a share of any profit made by B upon B’s disposal of, or of an interest in, the dwelling-house or part, and
(b)
the receipt of that sum would be treated (apart from this section) as a disposal falling with section 22 (disposal where capital sums derived from assets),

(3)
In this section, a “deferred sale agreement or order” is an agreement or order of a court which—

Carried interest: election to pay tax as scheme profits arise
(1)
TCGA 1992 is amended as follows.
(2)
After section 103KF insert—
“103KFA
Election for carried interest gains to be chargeable as scheme profits arise
(1)
An individual (“A”) may make an election under this section in respect of an investment scheme (“the relevant scheme”) if—
(a)
section 103KA applies in relation to A and the relevant scheme, or
(b)
it is reasonable to expect that it will apply in relation to A and the relevant scheme.
(2)
Subsection (3) applies for a tax year (“the relevant tax year”) where an election made under this section has effect for that tax year.
(3)
A chargeable gain is deemed to arise to A in the relevant tax year and is to be treated as accruing to A immediately before the end of the relevant tax year.
(4)
The amount of the gain is the amount given by reducing—
(a)
the amount of carried interest that would arise to A in the relevant tax year in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (5), by
(b)
the sum of chargeable gains deemed to arise to A under this section in respect of the relevant scheme in previous tax years.
(5)
Those circumstances are that—
(a)
all of the investments held by the relevant scheme in the relevant tax year, and previously held by the scheme, whose disposal would be relevant to A’s entitlement to carried interest, were disposed of in the relevant tax year,
(b)
the amount realised on the disposal of each investment that was not actually disposed of in, or before, the relevant tax year were the amount of the costs to the relevant scheme in acquiring that investment,
(c)
all income that was received by the scheme (whether before or during the relevant tax year) and that would be relevant to A’s entitlement to carried interest, were received in the relevant tax year, and
(d)
all profits realised by the scheme as a result of those disposals and the receipt of that income were distributed to its investors in the relevant tax year.
(6)
Where—
(a)
distributions were made by the scheme to external investors before the relevant tax year, and
(b)
the timing of those distributions affects the amount of carried interest that actually arises to A,
the amount of carried interest to be presumed to arise in the circumstances mentioned in subsection (5) is to reflect the fact those distributions were made before the relevant tax year.
(7)
But if reflecting that fact would lead to a presumption that an amount of carried interest had arisen before the relevant tax year, any such amount is to be presumed to arise in the relevant tax year.
(8)
A chargeable gain treated as accruing to an individual under subsection (3) is a chargeable gain accruing on the disposal of an asset situated outside the United Kingdom only to the extent that the individual performs investment management services in respect of the relevant scheme outside the United Kingdom.
(9)
An election under this section—
(a)
must be made by notice given to an officer of Revenue and Customs, and
(b)
may not be revoked.

Election in relation to scheme to apply to associated schemes
(1)
Where an election has been made under section 103KFA in relation to an investment scheme (“S”) that is associated with another investment scheme, the election applies in respect of the other scheme (whether or not the conditions for an election to be made in respect of the other scheme were met at that time).
(2)
“Associated”, in relation to two or more investments schemes, is to be construed in accordance with section 809FZZ of ITA 2007.
103KFC
Interaction with other charges
(1)
The accrual of a chargeable gain treated as accruing to an individual under section 103KFA(3) does not prevent the individual or any other person being charged to tax (whether income tax, capital gains tax or any other tax, and including as a result of section 103KA) in relation to carried interest that arises to the individual under arrangements with the relevant scheme.
(2)
But subsection (3) applies where an individual—
(a)
has made an election under section 103KFA,
(b)
has accrued a chargeable gain treated as accruing under section 103KFA(3),
(c)
has paid (and has not been repaid) an amount of capital gains tax that is attributable to that chargeable gain, and
(d)
is charged to tax (whether income tax, capital gains tax or another tax) in relation to carried interest that—
(i)
arises to the individual under arrangements with the relevant scheme, and
(ii)
arises in or after the tax year in which a gain first accrued under that section.
(3)
The individual may make a claim for one or more consequential adjustments to be made reducing the tax mentioned in subsection (2)(d).
(4)
On a claim under subsection (3) an officer of Revenue and Customs must make such of the consequential adjustments claimed (if any) as are just and reasonable.
(5)
The value of any consequential adjustments made must not exceed the lesser of—
(a)
the amount of capital gains tax paid as mentioned in subsection (2)(c), and
(b)
the tax charged as mentioned in subsection (2)(d).
(6)
Consequential adjustments may be made—
(a)
in respect of any period, and

(7)
No claim may be made under section 103KE (carried interest: avoidance of double taxation) in respect of tax charged as a result of the accrual of a chargeable gain treated as accruing to an individual under section 103KFA(3).
103KFD
Deemed accrual of loss where carried interest never arises
(1)
Subsection (3) applies where—
(a)
an individual has made an election under section 103KFA,
(b)
the individual has accrued a chargeable gain treated as accruing under section 103KFA(3), and
(c)
the conditions in subsection (2) are met.
(2)
Those conditions are that—
(a)
all, or substantially all, of the investments of the relevant scheme have been disposed of,
(b)
the amount of carried interest that has arisen to the individual in respect of the relevant scheme since the beginning of the first tax year in which a gain is treated as accruing under section 103KFA(3) is less than the sum of chargeable gains treated as accruing to the individual under that section, and
(c)
no further amount of carried interest can reasonably be expected to arise to the individual under arrangements with the relevant scheme.
(3)
The individual is to be treated as accruing a loss immediately before the end of the tax year in which the conditions in subsection (2) are first met.
(4)
The amount of that loss is the amount given by subtracting—
(a)
the amount of carried interest that arose to the individual in respect of the relevant scheme since the beginning of the first tax year in which a gain is treated as accruing under section 103KFA(3), from
(b)
the sum of the chargeable gains that have accrued under section 103KFA(3) (including any gain that accrues in respect of the tax year in which the loss accrues).
(5)
Where a loss has accrued to an individual as a result of subsection (3)—
(a)
section 103KFA(3) does not apply (in relation to the individual and the relevant scheme) for any tax year after the tax year in which the loss accrued, and
(b)
if carried interest arises to the individual in respect of the relevant scheme after the loss accrued, the individual may not make a claim under section 103KFC(3) in respect of tax charged in relation to it.
103KFE
Anti-avoidance
(1)
This section applies where an election was made by an individual under section 103KFA and the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of making the election is to cause a loss to be treated as accruing to the individual under subsection (3) of section 103KFD.
(2)
Any such loss that would (in the absence of this section) accrue to the individual under that subsection is to be counteracted by the making of such adjustments as are just and reasonable.
(3)
Any adjustments required to be made under this section (whether or not by an officer of Revenue and Customs) may be made by way of—
(a)
an assessment,
(b)
the modification of an assessment, or
(c)
amendment or disallowance of a claim, or otherwise.”

In section 1H (the main rates of CGT), in subsection (9)—

Introduction to multinational top-up tax
(1)
The purpose of this Part is to implement the provisions of the Pillar Two rules relating to top-up tax under the IIR (within the meaning of those rules).
(2)
For that purpose, this Part makes provision for a tax payable in respect of members of multinational groups who are located in territories (outside the United Kingdom) where their rate of tax (as determined in accordance with this Part) is less than 15%.
(3)
The tax is to be known as “multinational top-up tax”.
(4)
Sections 122 to 124 set out the charge to multinational top-up tax and describe how it is to be calculated.
(5)
Chapter 2 of this Part—
(a)
sets out the meaning of “multinational group”;
(b)
describes who the members of such a group are;
(c)
identifies the ultimate parent of such a group;
(d)
limits the application of this Part to multinational groups with an annual revenue of at least 750 million euros and that have at least one member in the United Kingdom (such a group is referred to in this Part as “qualifying”);
(e)
sets out how to determine which members of a multinational group (“responsible members”) are responsible for paying the tax and which members they are responsible for.122
Chargeable persons
(1)
A person is chargeable to multinational top-up tax for an accounting period of a multinational group if the group is a qualifying multinational group in that period and—
(a)
the person—
(i)
is a responsible member of the multinational group at any time in that period,
(ii)
is a body corporate or a partnership F1..., and
(iii)
is located in the United Kingdom, or
(b)
the person is chargeable to tax in respect of an entity that is a responsible member of the multinational group at any time in that period.
(2)
A person is chargeable to tax in respect of a responsible member of a multinational group if—
(a)
the profits of the responsible member would, on the relevant assumptions, be the profits of the person for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax,
(b)
the responsible member is located in the United Kingdom, and
(c)
the responsible member is not—
(i)
a body corporate, or
(ii)
a partnership F2....
(3)
The relevant assumptions are—
(a)
that the responsible member has profits that are chargeable to income tax or corporation tax, and
(b)
that the person is resident in the United Kingdom for the purposes of that tax.

Step 1
Determine which, if any, of the multinational group’s members that the responsible member is responsible for have top-up amounts or additional top-up amounts for that period and the extent of those amounts.
Step 2
Determine how much of each of those amounts is to be attributed to the responsible member.
Step 3
Add together the amounts attributed to the responsible member.
[F1Step 4
Convert the result of Step 3 (which in accordance with section 254 will be expressed in the CFS currency) to sterling using the average exchange rate for the accounting period (if the CFS currency is not sterling).]

(ii)
is less than 25% of the total revenue of the group, and]
F2(c)
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

(12)
For the purposes of subsections (6) and (7)—
(a)
despite section 232(3) (permanent establishments treated as distinct from main entity), the conditions in subsection (6)(b) and (7)(b) are only met in relation to a permanent establishment or a main entity if the conditions are met by the main entity and all of its permanent establishments taken together as if they were a single entity;
(b)
an excluded entity is “qualifying” if it is not a [F3pension services] entity, and

Qualifying multinational groups
(1)
For the purposes of this Part, a multinational group is “qualifying” in an accounting period if conditions A and B are met.
(2)
Condition A is that the group’s members have revenue that exceeds the threshold set out in subsection (4) in at least 2 accounting periods of the previous 4 accounting periods.
(3)
Condition B is that at least one of the group’s members is located in the United Kingdom.
(4)
The threshold for an accounting period is the amount given by multiplying 750 million euros by the amount given by dividing the number of days in the accounting period by 365.
(5)
For the purposes of this section, and section 127(5), the revenue of the members of a multinational group for a period is to be determined by reference to the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent for that period.130
Change in composition of multinational group
(1)
This section applies for the purpose of determining whether condition A in section 129(2) is met by a multinational group in an accounting period (“the qualifying period”) where its composition has changed—
(a)
in that period, or
(b)
during the previous 4 accounting periods (“the testing period”).
(2)
Reference in subsection (1) to a change in the composition of a multinational group includes its formation as a result of the acquisition by one entity of ownership interests in another.
(3)
Where a member of the multinational group was not a member of any consolidated group in one or more of the accounting periods in the testing period—
(a)
its revenues for those accounting periods are to be determined by reference to its financial statements or any consolidated financial statements in which its revenue is included (and, if necessary, apportioned on a just and reasonable basis to those accounting periods), and
(b)
those revenues are to be treated as forming part of the revenues of the multinational group in those periods (whether or not the group existed in those periods).
(4)
Where a multinational group is the result of a merger of two or more consolidated groups in the qualifying period or the testing period, for each accounting period of those periods in which they were separate groups, add together the revenues of each consolidated group for that period (determined by reference to the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent of each group and if necessary, apportioned on a just and reasonable basis to the accounting period of the merged group) to determine whether the threshold in section 129(4) is met for that period.
(5)
For the purposes of this section “merger” means any arrangement that results in [F1all, or substantially all, of the members of] two or more consolidated groups becoming [F2members of] a single consolidated group.

Whether de-merged groups meet the revenue threshold
(1)
Where a multinational group is the result of a qualifying de-merger (“a de-merged group”), section 129 has effect in relation to that group for its first accounting period that ends after the de-merger, and in the 3 accounting periods that follow it as if for subsection (2) there were substituted—
“(2)
A de-merged group meets condition A F1...—
(a)
in its first accounting period that ends after the de-merger, if its members have revenue for that period that exceeds the threshold set out in section 129(4), and
(b)
in any of the second to fourth accounting periods ending after the de-merger, if its members have revenue that exceeds the threshold set out in that section in any two of the following periods—
(i)
that period;
(ii)
any of the accounting periods that precede that period and end after the de-merger.”
[F2(2)
In this section “qualifying de-merger” means the separation of members of a relevant multinational group into two or more consolidated groups in an accounting period of the relevant multinational group, such that those members cease to all be consolidated by the same ultimate parent.
(3)
A multinational group is relevant in an accounting period if—
(a)
it meets condition A in section 129(2) for that period (revenue threshold exceeded in at least 2 of previous 4 accounting periods), and
(b)
Pillar Two rules apply to any member of the group for that period.]

Effective tax rate
(1)
The effective tax rate of the standard members of a multinational group in a territory for an accounting period is determined as follows—
Step 1
Determine, in accordance with Chapter 4, the adjusted profits for that period of each standard member of that group in that territory.
Step 2
Subtract the sum of the losses of those members of the group that made a loss in that period from the sum of the profits of those members of the group that made a profit in that period.
Step 3
If the result of Step 2 is nil or less, the effective tax rate is to be treated as 15%. Otherwise, proceed to Step 4.
Step 4
Determine the combined covered tax balance for the standard members of the group in that territory (which may be negative).
Step 5
If that balance is nil the effective tax rate is 0%. Otherwise, proceed to Step 6.
Step 6
Divide the combined covered tax balance by the result of Step 2.
Step 7
Except where Step 3 or 5 applies, the effective tax rate of the standard members of that group is X% where X (which will be negative if the combined covered tax balance is negative) is the result of Step 6 multiplied by 100.
(2)
The combined covered tax balance for standard members of a multinational group in a territory is—
(a)
where those members only have positive covered tax balances (see Chapter 5), the sum of those balances,
(b)
where those members only have negative covered tax balances (see that Chapter), the sum of those balances expressed as a negative number, or
(c)
where those members have a mixture of positive covered tax balances and negative covered tax balances, the amount (which may be positive or negative) given by subtracting the sum of those negative covered tax balances from the sum of those positive covered tax balances.
Section [F1174] contains provision about the determination of covered tax balances of members of multinational groups.
(3)
For the purposes of this Part—
(a)
a member of a multinational group is a “standard member” if it is not—
(i)
an investment entity, or
(ii)
a minority owned member, and
(b)
a stateless member of a multinational group is to be treated as being the sole member of the group located in a nominal territory.

Adjusted profits of a member of a multinational group
(1)
For the purposes of this Part, references to the adjusted profits of a member of a multinational group are to the underlying profits of that member adjusted in accordance with this Chapter and (to the extent applicable) Chapter 8.
(2)
Sections 134 to 137 set out how to determine the underlying profits.
(3)
Sections 138 to 158 set out various adjustments that may need to be made to those profits.
(4)
Sections 159 and 160 set out adjustments to be made in relation to members that are permanent establishments.
(5)
Sections 161 to 164 make provision for elections for certain matters to be calculated in an alternative manner.
(6)
Sections 167 to 171 set out adjustments in relation to transparent and hybrid entities and entities subject to a “qualifying dividend regime”.
(7)
Other provisions of this Part may require further adjustments of underlying profits, including provision in—
(a)
Chapter 9 (investment entities), and
(b)
Schedule 16 (transitional provision).134
Underlying profits as determined for statements of ultimate parent
(1)
The normal rule is that the underlying profits of a member of a multinational group, other than a member that is a permanent establishment, are the member’s profits as they would be determined for that member in preparing consolidated financial statements for the ultimate parent.
(2)
But those profits may instead be determined on the basis of an alternative accounting standard, and information in the separate financial accounts of the member, if all of the conditions in subsection (3) are met.
(3)
Those conditions are that—
(a)
it is not reasonably practicable to determine those profits on the basis of the accounting standard used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent,
(b)
the alternative accounting standard is an acceptable accounting standard or an authorised accounting standard,
(c)
the alternative accounting standard is that used for the financial accounts of the member, and
(d)
the information in those accounts is reliable.
(4)
Where an alternative accounting standard is used and an amount relevant to the underlying profits of a member of a multinational group is recorded in a currency other than the currency used for the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent, that amount is to be converted to that currency for the purposes of this Part.
(5)
Subsection (6) applies where the application of a particular policy of the alternative accounting standard in the determination of the profits of the member results in a significant accounting standard difference that would not arise if the accounting standard of the ultimate parent had been applied.
(6)
The underlying profits are to be adjusted to eliminate that difference (as if the accounting standard of the ultimate parent had been applied).
(7)
Information in the financial accounts of the member is “reliable” if an auditor applying the generally accepted auditing standards of a relevant territory would reasonably conclude the member has in place such processes relating to their preparation as are likely to make the information in the financial accounts a fair and accurate description of the income, expenses, assets and liabilities of that member.
(8)
For the purposes of subsection (7), the following are relevant territories—
(a)
the territory in which the member is located;
(b)
the territory in which the ultimate parent is located;
(c)
if the member is a flow-through entity (see section 168(2)) that is a stateless entity, the territory in which it was created.

(b)
in relation to a purchaser if, under the law of that territory, credits of that type may be transferred to a person or entity that is not connected with the purchaser—

(7)
In making that determination, assume that the entity that holds it will be able to use it in the accounting periods in which it may be used.

that have—
(i)
the same, or a similar, maturity to the period over which the credit is to be used, or
(ii)

one of the members (“A”) is a high tax member,
(b)
there is a permanent difference for A in respect of the transaction which arises as a result of adjustments made in connection with transfer pricing, and
(c)
there is no permanent difference for the other member (“B”) in respect of the transaction arising as a result of adjustments made in connection with transfer pricing.
(5)
Where this subsection applies—
(a)
the underlying profits of A are to be adjusted so that the amount of the transaction reflects the amount reflected in the member’s taxable income, and
(b)
an adjustment is to be made to the underlying profits of B which corresponds with the amount of the adjustment made to the profits of A.
(6)
For the purposes of this section, a member of a multinational group is a high tax member for an accounting period (“the relevant period”) if—
(a)
the nominal tax rate [F1that applies to the member] is, or exceeds, 15% in the relevant period, and
(b)
the effective tax rate of the standard members of that group in [F2the territory in which the member is located] is, or exceeds, 15% in either, or both, of the accounting period that immediately preceded the relevant period and the accounting period immediately before that one.
[F3(6A)
But—
(a)
for the purposes of subsection (6)(b), ignore any accounting period in which there was no standard member of the group in that territory to which the Pillar Two rules applied, and
(b)
a standard member of a multinational group is always to be regarded as a high tax member for an accounting period if a transitional safe harbour election applies to it for that period.]
(7)
In this section reference to a “permanent difference” is to a difference between the treatment of an amount for the purposes of covered taxes and for accounting purposes that is not eliminated over time (and accordingly does not give rise to deferred tax).

Divide the result of Step 3 by two. This is the cap threshold.
Step 6
Calculate the ancillary international shipping profits for each member of the group in the territory (ignoring the requirement to subtract the ancillary international shipping profit cap adjustment).
Step 7
Add together the amounts calculated at Step 6.
Step 8
Subtract the cap threshold from the result of Step 7. If the result is nil or less, the member’s ancillary international shipping profit cap adjustment is nil. Otherwise, proceed to Step 9.
Step 9
If the ancillary international shipping profits for the member calculated at Step 6 are nil or less, the member’s ancillary international shipping profit cap adjustment is nil. Otherwise, proceed to Step 10.
Step 10
Add together any positive ancillary international shipping profits calculated at Step 6.
Step 11
Divide the ancillary international shipping profits for the member calculated at Step 6 by the result of Step 10.

(2)
So much of that loss as—
(a)
is treated as an allowable expense of the main entity for the purposes of the computation of tax in the territory in which the main entity is located, and
(b)
is not set off against an item of income that is subject to tax under the laws of both the territory of the permanent establishment and the territory of the main entity,

tangible assets that are subject to fair value accounting or impairment accounting.
(2)
Where such an election is in force in relation to members of multinational group in a territory—
(a)
the underlying profits of each of the group’s members for each of the accounting periods in respect of which the election is in force are to be adjusted so as to exclude gains and losses in respect of assets or liabilities to which the election applies that are attributable to fair value or impairment accounting;
(b)
the carrying value of an asset or liability to which the election applies to be used for the purposes of determining gains or losses in respect of that asset or liability, is to be its carrying value at the later of—
(i)
the commencement of the first accounting period of the multinational group to which the election applied, or
(ii)
the time the asset was acquired or the liability was incurred.
(3)
Paragraph 1 of Schedule 15 (long term elections) applies to an election under this section.
(4)
Where an election under this section has been revoked, the underlying profits of each member of a multinational group in respect of which the election was in force are to be adjusted in the first accounting period in respect of which the election no longer applies (“the revocation period”) by adjusting for the change in treatment of the assets and liabilities that were subject to the election and that remain held by the member at the commencement of the revocation period.
(5)
To adjust the underlying profits of a member of a multinational group for the change in treatment of an asset or liability subject to an election under this section, subtract the carrying value of that asset or liability as determined in accordance with subsection (2)(b) from the fair value of the asset or liability at the commencement of the revocation period and—
(a)
if the amount given is positive, add it to those profits, or
(b)
if the amount is negative, subtract it from those profits.162
Election to reflect deductions for stock-based compensation
(1)

(2)
Where such an election has effect—
(a)
the underlying profits of each such member is adjusted by substituting, for the amount of any expense for stock-based compensation, the amount that was allowed as a deduction for the same expense when calculating the member’s taxable income, and
(b)
where such a member has an expense for stock-based compensation that arises in connection with an option that expires without exercise, the underlying profits of that member for the accounting period in which the option expires are to be increased by such amount of that expense as was an expense in determining the member’s adjusted profits for a previous accounting period.
(3)
Where—
(a)
the underlying profits of a member of a multinational group are adjusted in accordance with subsection (2) in respect of an amount of stock-based compensation,
(b)

Election to spread certain capital gains over five years
(1)
The filing member of a multinational group may elect that the net gain in respect of the disposal of local tangible assets by standard members of the group in a territory in an accounting period (“the election period”) is to be spread across that period and the preceding 4 accounting periods ([F1and those preceding periods are referred to collectively as] “the look-back period”) in accordance with subsection (2).
(2)
To spread the net gain across those periods take the following steps—
[F2Step 1
For each standard member of the group in the territory in the first accounting period of the look-back period (“the carry-back period”), determine whether it has net losses in respect of the disposal of local tangible assets (ignoring any losses in relation to which these steps have previously been carried out).]
Step 2
Allocate the proportion of the net gain in the election period to each standard member with such losses in the carry-back period that is equal to the proportion those losses represent of the total losses in respect of the disposal of local tangible assets of all such members of the group in the carry-back period.
Step 3
Adjust the underlying profits of each such member by reducing the member’s losses (but not below nil) by the amount allocated to it under Step 2.
Step 4
If there remains an amount of the net gain which was not used to reduce members’ losses in accordance with Step 3, carry out Steps 1 to 3 again, but as if—
(a)
the reference in Step 2 to the net gain were to that amount, and
(b)
the reference to the first accounting period of the look-back period were to the second accounting period of the look-back period.
Step 5
If there still remains an amount of the net gain which was not used to reduce the members’ losses, carry out Steps 1 to 3 again but as if—
(a)
the reference in Step 2 to the net gain were to that amount, and
(b)
the reference to the first accounting period of the look-back period were to the third accounting period of the look-back period.
Step 6
If there still remains an amount of the net gain which was not used to reduce the members’ losses, carry out Steps 1 to 3 again but as if—
(a)
the reference in Step 2 to the net gain were to that amount, and
(b)
the reference to the first accounting period of the look-back period were to the fourth accounting period of the look-back period.
Step 7
If there still remains an amount of the net gain which was not used to reduce the members’ losses, carry out Steps 1 to 3 again but as if—
(a)
the reference in Step 2 to the net gain were to that amount, and
(b)
the reference to the first accounting period of the look-back period were to the election period.
Step 8
If there still remains an amount of the net gain which was not used to reduced the members’ losses, divide the amount remaining by 5.
[F3Step 9
Determine which of the standard members of the group (“current gain members”) located in the territory have net gains from the disposal of local tangible assets in the election period.
A current gain member is not to be regarded as a current gain member in any accounting period in which—
(a)
it is not a standard member of the group, or
(b)
it is not located in the territory.
Step 10
For the election period and each accounting period that is in the look-back period, adjust the underlying profits for that period (“the adjustment period”) of each current gain member by adding the amount given by multiplying—
(a)
the result of Step 8, by
(b)
the amount given by dividing—
(i)
the net gains of the current gain member from the disposal of local tangible assets in the election period, by
(ii)
the sum of net gains from the disposal of local tangible assets in the election period of all current gain members in the adjustment period.
Step 11
Where there are no current gain members in an accounting period in the look-back period, adjust the underlying profits for that period of each standard member located in the territory for that period by adding the amount given by multiplying—
(a)
the result of Step 8, by
(b)
the amount given by dividing 1 by the number of standard members of the group in the territory in that accounting period.
Step 12
Where there are no standard members of the group in the territory in one or more accounting periods in the look-back period, further adjust the underlying profits for the election period of each current gain member by adding the amount given by multiplying—
(a)
the result of Step 8 multiplied by the number of accounting periods in the look-back period in which no standard members of the group were located in the territory, by
(b)
the amount given by dividing—
(i)
the net gains of the current gain member from the disposal of local tangible assets in the election period, by
(ii)
the sum of net gains from the disposal of local tangible assets in the election period of all current gain members.]
(3)
For the purposes of this section any gain or loss arising from the transfer of assets between F4... members of a multinational group is to be ignored.
(4)
Where, as a result of an election under this section, the underlying profits of a member of a multinational group in an accounting period is adjusted, the following are to be recalculated for that period—
(a)
the effective tax rate for the member and the other members of that group located in the same territory, and
(b)
the top-up amounts that those members would have.
(5)
Section 206—
(a)
makes provision about the consequences of a recalculation (which may include the generation of an additional top-up amount), and
(b)
applies to recalculations under subsection (4).
(6)
Where an election under this section has effect in relation to a member of a multinational group, any amount of tax with respect to any gains or loss in respect of the disposal of local tangible assets in the election year is to be excluded from the calculation of the member’s covered tax balance.
(7)
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 15 (annual elections) applies to an election under this section.
(8)
In this section “local tangible asset” means immovable property in the same territory as the member disposing of it is located.

(3)
Accordingly, such a member is to be treated as a flow-through entity.170
Adjustments for ultimate parent that is a flow-through entity
(1)
Where—
(a)
the ultimate parent of a multinational group is a flow-through entity, and

(a)
it represents an amount of the ultimate parent’s profits to which the holder of [F1a direct ownership interest] in the ultimate parent is entitled as a result of that interest, and
(b)
condition A, B or C is met.
[F2(2A)
Where profits are allocated to the ultimate parent as a result of section 168 (underlying profits of transparent and reverse hybrid entities), those profits are to be regarded, for the purposes of this section, as profits to which holders of ownership interests in the ultimate parent are entitled (to each in proportion to the proportion of those profits to which they would have been entitled had those profits actually accrued to the ultimate parent).]

taxes payable by the holder of the ownership interest in respect of the amount of the ultimate parent’s profits to which the holder is entitled,
is equal to, or more than, 15% of the amount of the profits of the ultimate parent to which the holder of the interest is entitled.
(4)
Condition B is that the holder of the ownership interest is an individual that—
(a)
is tax resident in the territory of the ultimate parent, and
(b)
does not hold ownership interests that together entitle the person to more than 5% of the profits and assets of the ultimate parent.
(5)

(b)
in the case of a negative covered tax balance, to be increased by that same proportion.
(7)
Where—
(a)
the ultimate parent of a multinational group is a flow-through entity,
(b)
on determining its adjusted profits for an accounting period (ignoring this section), it has made a loss for that period,
those profits are to be further adjusted so as to exclude any disqualified amount of that loss.
(8)
An amount of that loss is disqualified if the holder of an ownership interest in the ultimate parent is allowed to use that amount in computing the holder’s taxable income.
(9)
This section applies to a member of a multinational group as it applies to the ultimate parent if the member is—
(a)
a permanent establishment through which the ultimate parent wholly or partly carries out its business, if the ultimate parent is a flow-through entity, or
(b)
a permanent establishment through which the business of a flow-through entity is carried out, if the ultimate parent’s interest in that entity is held directly or through one or more entities all of which are regarded as tax transparent in the territory in which the ultimate parent is located.

(b)
where the ultimate parent receives amounts from members referred to in subsection (3)(c)(ii), those amounts fund distributions that meet one of conditions A to C in section 171 before distributions that do not.173

Tax credits etc allocated under tax equity partnerships
(1)
Where—
(a)
a member of a multinational group is an investor in a tax equity partnership arrangement, and
(b)
an election under section 165 (excluded equity gains and losses included) applies in relation to the member for an accounting period,
qualifying flow-through tax benefits provided to the member under that arrangement in that period are to be excluded from the covered tax balance of that member for that period.
(2)
“Flow-through tax benefits” means tax credits, other than qualifying refundable tax credits, and the value of amounts of tax deductible losses made available to be used by an investor in a tax equity partnership arrangement under that arrangement (whether or not those credits or losses are used by the investor).
(3)
Section 176E (proportional amortisation method) applies for the purposes of determining the extent to which flow-through tax benefits are “qualifying” where—
(a)
in determining the underlying profits of the investor, the proportional amortisation method is used to account for the arrangement, or
(b)
the filing member of the multinational group of which the investor is a member has elected that section 176D should apply for those purposes in relation to the member.
(4)
Otherwise, section 176F (subtraction method) applies for those purposes.
(5)
For the purposes of this Part, a member of a multinational group is an investor in a tax equity partnership arrangement if—
(a)
the member has made an investment in an entity that is tax transparent in the territory in which the member is located,
(b)
the investment is treated as an equity interest for tax purposes in the territory in which the member is located,
(c)
the investment would, under an authorised accounting standard of the territory in which the entity operates, be treated as an equity interest,
(d)
the entity is not a member of the multinational group, and
(e)
it is reasonable to expect, at the time of making the investment, that the return on the investment would be negative in the absence of the provision of flow-through tax benefits.
(6)
But a member of a multinational group is not to be regarded as an investor in a tax equity partnership arrangement if—
(a)
the investment in the entity does not represent a genuine economic interest in that entity such that the member is exposed to the possibility of a loss on the investment, or
(b)
the territory in which the member is located limits the use of tax equity partnership arrangements to arrangements that involve a multinational group subject to multinational top-up tax or its equivalent under the law of a territory outside the United Kingdom.
(7)
Flow-through tax benefits provided to a member of a multinational group in an accounting period that are not qualifying are to be reflected as a credit in the covered tax balance for that period.
(8)
Flow-through tax benefits (whether qualifying or not) provided to a member of a multinational group are not to be reflected in the underlying profits of that member, even if that would be the effect of the election under section 165.
(9)
For the purposes of subsection (3)(a), the “proportional amortisation method” means a method of accounting under which—
(a)
the initial capital investment in the arrangement is amortised over the term of the investment with the amortisation expense for an accounting period based on the proportion of the flow-through tax benefits expected to be provided over the term of the arrangement that are expected to be provided in that period, and
(b)
the difference between the flow-through tax benefits received in an accounting period and that amortisation expense for that period is reflected as tax expense.
(10)
For the purposes of this section and sections 176E and 176F, the value of an amount of tax deductible losses made available to be used by an investor is given by multiplying the amount multiplied by the tax rate that applies to the investor.

Flow-through tax benefits: proportional amortisation method
(1)
Where this section applies, to determine the extent to which flow-through tax benefits provided to an investor in an accounting period under a tax equity partnership arrangement are qualifying, take the following steps—
Step 1
Determine the amount of capital investment provided by the investor to the arrangement at its commencement.
Step 2
Divide the flow-through through tax benefits provided under the arrangement in the accounting period by the total flow-through tax benefits expected to be provided over the whole term of the arrangement.
Step 3
Multiply the result of Step 1 by the result of Step 2.
Step 4
Add the following together—
(a)
the amounts, if any, of tax credits made available to be used by the investor under the arrangement in the accounting period;
(b)
the value of the amounts, if any, of tax deductible losses made available to be used by the investor under the arrangement in the accounting period;
(c)
the amounts, if any, of distributions made to the investor in the accounting period;
(d)
the amounts, if any, received by the investor for the sale of any part of its investment in the arrangement in the accounting period.
Step 5
If the result of Step 3 is equal to or greater than the result of Step 4, all of the flow-through tax benefits provided under the arrangement in the accounting period are qualifying.
Otherwise proceed to Step 6.
Step 6
Subtract the result of Step 3 from the result of Step 4.
Step 7
The amount of the flow-through benefits provided under the arrangement in the accounting period that is qualifying is the amount given by reducing the amount of those benefits (but not below nil) by the result of Step 6.
(2)
Accordingly, the amount by which those benefits are reduced in accordance with Step 7 represents non-qualifying flow-through tax benefits which are to be reflected as a credit in the investor’s covered tax balance.]

Flow-through tax benefits: subtraction method
Where this section applies, to determine the extent to which flow-through tax benefits provided to an investor in an accounting period under a tax equity partnership arrangement are qualifying, take the following steps—
Step 1
Determine the amount of capital investment provided by the investor to the arrangement at its commencement.
Step 2
Subtract the following from that amount—
(a)
the amounts, if any, of tax credits made available to be used by the investor under the arrangement since the commencement of the arrangement, other than tax credits that are not qualifying refundable tax credits that were made available in the accounting period;
(b)
the value of the amounts, if any, of tax deductible losses made available to be used by the investor under the arrangement since its commencement, other than losses made available in the accounting period;
(c)
the amounts, if any, of distributions made to the investor since the arrangement’s commencement;
(d)
the amounts, if any, received by the investor for the sale of any part of its investment in the arrangement.
Step 3
If the result of Step 2 is nil or less, no flow-through tax benefits provided under arrangement in the accounting period are qualifying.
If the result of that step is more than nil, proceed to Step 4.
Step 4
Subtract the flow-through tax benefits provided to the investor in the accounting period under the arrangement from the result of Step 2.
Step 5
If the result of Step 4 is nil or greater, all of the flow-through tax benefits provided under the arrangement in the accounting period are qualifying.
Otherwise, the amount of those benefits that is qualifying is the amount of those benefits that when subtracted from the result of Step 2 would give a result of nil.]

Blended CFC regimes
(1)
This section applies to accounting periods commencing on or before 31 December 2025 that end on or before 30 June 2027.
(2)
Subsection (3) applies where—
(a)
a member of a multinational group (“C”) is subject to a blended CFC regime in an accounting period (“the relevant period”),
(b)
C has an ownership interest in an entity (“F”) that is a F1... CFC entity in relation to C, and
(c)
the blended CFC allocation key of F is greater than nil.
(3)
The appropriate proportion of tax charged to C under that regime (after all deductions and use of any losses) is—
(a)
where F is a member of the same multinational group as C, to be allocated to F, or
(b)
where F is not a member of that group, to be excluded from the covered tax balance of C.
(4)
The appropriate proportion is the proportion given by dividing the blended CFC allocation key for F for the relevant period by the sum of all blended CFC allocation keys for that period of F2... CFC entities in which C has an ownership interest.
(5)
The blended CFC allocation key for the relevant period of a F3... CFC entity that C has an ownership interest in is the amount given by multiplying—
(a)
the attributable income of C [F4in relation to the CFC entity], by
(b)
the percentage given by subtracting the applicable effective tax rate of the F5... CFC entity for the relevant period from the applicable CFC rate for that period.
(6)
But where—
(a)
the result of subsection (5)(b) in relation to a F6... CFC entity is less than nil, or
(b)
the applicable effective tax rate of that entity is greater than 15%,
the blended CFC allocation key for that entity is to be treated as nil.
(7)
The attributable income of C [F7in relation to a CFC entity in which C has an ownership interest] means C’s share of the income of [F8the entity] for the relevant period determined as it would be determined for the purposes of the blended CFC regime.
(8)
The applicable effective tax rate of a F9... CFC entity for the relevant period is—
(a)
where it is located in a territory in which the effective tax rate of members of the multinational group of which C is a member is calculated for that period, that effective tax rate as it would be calculated if—
(i)
any tax arising under a blended CFC regime were ignored, and
(ii)
where the blended CFC regime permits foreign tax credit in respect of a qualifying domestic top-up tax on the same basis it would be permitted for covered taxes, that qualifying domestic top-up tax were a covered tax, or
(b)
where it is not located in such a territory, the effective tax rate that would be calculated for the relevant period for the F10... CFC entities located in that territory in which C has an ownership interest if—
(i)
those entities were members of a multinational group whose ultimate parent’s accounting period is the same as the relevant period,
[F11(ii)
the result of Step 2 in section 132(1) for those entities were the aggregate of their profits (and losses) before tax as shown in their financial accounts,
(iia)
the combined covered tax balance for those entities were the aggregate of the taxes shown in their financial accounts,]
(iii)
any tax arising under a blended CFC regime were ignored, and
(iv)
where the blended CFC regime permits foreign tax credit in respect of a qualifying domestic top-up tax on the same basis it would be permitted for covered taxes, that qualifying domestic top-up tax were a covered tax.
(9)
The applicable CFC rate for the relevant period means the rate which reflects the threshold for low taxation by reference to which the blended CFC regime is generally operated, taking into account any credit for foreign taxes available under the regime.

Distributions from other members of a group
(1)
Where qualifying current tax expense in respect of covered taxes accrued in an accounting period in the underlying profits accounts of a member of a multinational group (“R”) is in respect of a distribution received from another member of the group (“D”) in which R has a direct ownership interest, that expense is to be allocated to D.
(2)
Reference in subsection (1) to a distribution received is to be treated as including deemed distributions taken account of for the purposes of taxes on a shareholder of an entity in respect of undistributed earnings or capital of the entity.182
Total deferred tax adjustment amount
(1)
The total deferred tax adjustment amount for a member of a multinational group for an accounting period is the deferred tax expense relating to covered taxes reflected in the member’s underlying profits, adjusted as follows.
(2)
The deferred tax expense is to be adjusted to exclude the following—
(a)
any amount of that expense that reflects items not reflected in the member’s adjusted profits;
(b)
any amount of that expense that reflects disallowed accruals or unclaimed accruals;
(c)
the impact of a valuation adjustment or accounting recognition adjustment with respect to a deferred tax asset;
(d)

(3)
Where a deferred tax liability is reversed in an accounting period, and that deferred tax liability was treated as an unclaimed accrual in a previous accounting period, the deferred tax expense is to be increased by the amount of the deferred tax liability that has reversed.
(4)
Where a deferred tax asset is not reflected in the deferred tax expense only as a result of the recognition criteria not being met, that deferred tax asset is to be reflected in the total deferred tax adjustment amount.
(5)
Where the amount of a deferred tax asset is adjusted as a result of section 186, an amount equal to that adjustment is to be reflected in the total deferred tax adjustment amount.
(6)
Where an amount of recaptured deferred tax liability (see section 184) that was determined for a previous accounting period is reversed during the accounting period, that amount is to be reflected in the total deferred tax adjustment amount.
(7)
Where the deferred tax expense relates to covered taxes where the rate is greater than 15%, the amount of that expense (after adjustment under subsections (2) to (6)) is to be adjusted so that it reflects the amount it would have been had the rate been 15%.
(8)
For the purposes of this section—
“disallowed accrual” means—
(a)
any movement in deferred tax expense reflected in the member’s underlying profits which relates to an uncertain tax position, or

(b)
in respect of which the filing member has elected not to include in the total deferred tax adjustment amount for that period.
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 15 (annual elections) applies to an election not to include an unclaimed accrual in the total deferred tax adjustment amount.183
Qualifying foreign tax credits (substitute loss carry forward assets)
(1)
A qualifying foreign tax credit of a member of a multinational group is to be included in the member’s total deferred tax adjustment amount.
(2)
A foreign tax credit is qualifying if—
(a)
the territory in which the member is located—
(i)
requires that domestic losses are offset against relevant foreign income before foreign tax credits can be applied against tax on foreign income, and
(ii)
permits foreign tax credits to be used to offset tax on domestic profits to the extent to which domestic losses have been offset against relevant foreign income in a previous taxable period,
(b)
the member has used a domestic loss to offset (in whole or in part) relevant foreign income, and
(c)
the foreign tax credit is in respect of tax imposed by another territory on that foreign income.

(b)
the territory limits the extent to which foreign tax credits can be applied against tax in a taxable period,
(c)
the territory allows foreign tax credits to be used to a greater extent where a domestic loss has been used to offset (in whole or in part) relevant foreign income in a prior period, and

the member has used a domestic loss to offset (in whole or in part) relevant foreign income.
(3)
Where this subsection applies, the member has a special foreign tax asset arising in the accounting period in which the loss was used.

Recaptured deferred tax liabilities
(1)
A member of a multinational group has a recaptured deferred tax liability if it has a deferred tax liability, other than an excluded liability, taken into account in its total deferred tax adjustment amount for an accounting period (“the initial period”) that is not reversed before the end of the fifth accounting period after the initial period.
(2)
Where a member of a multinational group has a recaptured deferred tax liability—
(a)
the amount included in the total deferred tax adjustment amount for the initial period in relation to that recaptured deferred tax liability is to be excluded from its covered tax balance for that period, and
(b)
the following are to be accordingly recalculated for the initial period—

Inclusion of existing deferred tax assets and liabilities on entry into regime
(1)
This section applies to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of a member of a multinational group as at the beginning of the first accounting period for which Pillar Two rules apply to it that is reflected in its underlying profits accounts (and the adjustments set out in this section apply instead of those set out in section 182(2) to (7)).
(2)
Each such asset and liability is to be taken into account in determining the member’s deferred tax expense—
(a)
if the nominal tax rate in relation to the asset [F1or liability]—
(i)
is less than 15% and subsection (3) does not apply, at its nominal tax rate,
(ii)
is 15% or more, as if the rate of tax to which the asset or liability related was 15%,
(b)
in the case of a deferred tax asset, excluding the impact of a valuation adjustment or accounting recognition adjustment with respect to it.
(3)
But where—
(a)
the nominal tax rate in relation to the asset is less than 15%, and
(b)
the member can demonstrate that a deferred tax asset is attributable to the fact of the member having a loss which would have been taken account of in determining adjusted profits had those profits been determined under this Part,
that asset is to be taken into account in determining the member’s deferred tax expense as if the rate of tax to which the asset related was 15%.
(4)
Where a deferred tax asset relates to a tax credit neither subsection (2)(a) nor (3) applies.
(5)
If the nominal tax rate that applies on the reversal of such a tax asset exceeds 15%, the amount of the reversal is to be treated as if it were the amount given by multiplying—
(a)
the amount given by dividing—
(i)
the amount of the deferred tax expense in the underlying profits accounts in respect of that deferred tax asset, by
(ii)
the nominal tax rate that applied on the reversal, by
(b)
15%.
(6)
Subsection (7) applies to a deferred tax asset of a member of a qualifying multinational group that arises—
(a)
as a result of a transaction made after 30 November 2021 and before the commencement of the first accounting period for which Pillar Two rules apply to it, and
(b)
in relation to an item that either—
(i)
is included in the member’s taxable income but which would not be included in the member’s adjusted profits (had those profits been determined under this Part), or
(ii)
is not included in the member’s taxable income but which would be included in the member’s adjusted profits (had those profits been determined under this Part).
(7)

(b)
the amount of tax that would have been due in that territory if all of those members had distributed all of their profits of that period.
(3)
The combined covered tax balance of those members for that period, as determined under Step 4 in section 132(1), is to be increased by adding that deemed distribution tax amount.

If those members have more than one recapture amount in the relevant period, those reductions are to be applied first to the recapture amount in respect of the earliest accounting period, then the next earliest and so on.
(3)
First, if any of the members have accrued qualifying taxes in the relevant period reduce the recapture amount (but not below nil) by the amount of qualifying taxes accrued by the members in that period that is available.
(4)
Then, if the members have a collective loss for the relevant period (and if the recapture amount has not been reduced to nil) reduce the recapture amount (but not below nil) by the amount of that loss that is available multiplied by 15%.
(5)
Finally, if the members have a qualifying carried forward loss (and if the recapture amount has not been reduced to nil) reduce the recapture amount (but not below nil) by the amount of the qualifying carried forward loss that is available.
(6)
An amount is “available” to the extent it has not been used to reduce another recapture amount (in the case of a qualifying carried forward loss, whether in that period or a previous period).
(7)
For the purposes of subsections (3) to (6)—
“qualifying taxes” means taxes accrued in the relevant period on actual or deemed distributions of profits;
members of the group have a “collective loss” for an accounting period if the result of Step 2 in section 132(1) is less than nil, and the amount of that loss is that result expressed as a positive number,
members of the group have a “qualifying carried forward loss” if —
(a)
they had a collective loss in a period, and
(b)
after making reductions in accordance with subsections (2) to (5) an amount of that collective loss remains available,
and the amount of that qualifying carried forward loss is the amount of the collective loss that remained available.
(8)
Any amount of qualifying taxes accrued by a member of the group that is used to reduce a recapture amount is excluded from that member’s covered tax balance.192
Recalculation where member leaves the group
(1)
This section applies where—
(a)
in an accounting period (“the relevant period”), a standard member of a multinational group (“D”) in a territory (“the relevant territory”)—
(i)
leaves the group,
(ii)
transfers all, or substantially all, of its assets to an entity who is not a member of the group or to an individual, or
(iii)
transfers all, or substantially all, of its assets to a member of the group that is not located in the relevant territory, and
(b)
the standard members (including D) of the group in the relevant territory (“the relevant members”) had, in previous accounting periods, one or more recapture amounts (each a “recapture period”).
(2)
Where this section applies, the following are to be recalculated for each recapture period—
(a)
the effective tax rate for the relevant members, and
(b)
the top-up amounts that those members would have in accordance with that recalculation.
(3)
In recalculating that rate and those amounts for each of those periods, deduct the amount of each recapture amount that was outstanding in the period (after any reduction under section 191 in that period) from the combined covered tax balance of those members for the period.
(4)
The relevant members have a special additional top-up tax amount under this section for the relevant period that is equal to the sum of the amounts given by—
(a)
subtracting the amount of top-up amounts those members had for each recapture period from the sum of the top-up amounts those members would have for that period as recalculated under subsection (2)(b), and
(b)
multiplying the result of paragraph (a) for each recapture period by the disposition recapture ratio for that period.
(5)
Subject to subsections (6) and (7), the disposition recapture ratio for an accounting period is the amount given by dividing—
(a)
the adjusted profits of D in that period, by
(b)
the result of Step 2 in section 132(1) for the relevant members for that period.
(6)
If either of the amounts described in paragraph (a) or (b) of subsection (5) is nil or less, the disposition recapture ratio is nil.
(7)
If (ignoring this subsection) the disposition recapture ratio would be greater than 1, it is to be treated as 1.
(8)
Sections 206 and 207 include further provision about special additional top-up tax amounts under this section.
(9)
Each of the amounts mentioned in subsection (10) for each affected period is to be treated, for the purposes of this Part, as the amount given by multiplying—
(a)
that amount, by
(b)
the amount given by subtracting the disposition recapture ratio for that period from 1.
(10)
Those amounts are—
(a)
the result of Step 2 in section 132(1) for those members for that period;
(b)
the combined covered tax balance of the standard members of the group in the relevant territory;
(c)
any recapture amount those members have in that affected period;
(d)
the substance based income exclusion for that period for that territory.
(11)
An accounting period is an affected period if it is—
(a)
a recapture period, or
(b)
the relevant period and the standard members of the group in the territory have one or more recapture amounts in that period.193
Calculation of top-up amounts
Take the following steps to determine if a standard member of a multinational group (“the member in question”) has a top-up amount for an accounting period and, if it does, the extent of it—
Step 1
Determine, under section 194, the total top-up amount for the accounting period for the territory the member in question is located in.
Step 2
If the total top-up amount for that territory is nil, the member in question does not have a top-up amount. Otherwise, proceed to Step 3.
Step 3
Determine the adjusted profits of the member in question for the period (in accordance with Chapter 4).
Step 4
If the member has not made a profit for the period (as determined by reference to its adjusted profits), the member in question does not have a top-up amount. Otherwise, proceed to Step 5.
Step 5
If there are no other standard members of the multinational group located in the same territory as the member in question, the member’s top-up amount is equal to the total top-up amount for that territory for the period. Otherwise, proceed to Step 6.
Step 6
Determine (in accordance with Chapter 4) the adjusted profits for the period of all of the other standard members of the group that are located in same territory as the member in question.
Step 7
Add together the adjusted profits of all standard members of the group in that territory that have profits (including those of the member in question).
Step 8
Divide the member in question’s adjusted profits by the result of Step 7.
Step 9
The member’s top-up amount is the result of multiplying the total top-up amount for the territory by the result of Step 8.194
Total top-up amount for a territory
(1)
Take the following steps to determine the total top-up amount for an accounting period for a territory—
Step 1
Subtract the effective tax rate of the standard members of the group in that territory for that period (as determined in accordance with section 132) from 15%.
Step 2
If the result of Step 1 is nil or less, the total top-up amount for that territory is nil. Otherwise, proceed to Step 3.
Step 3
Subtract the sum of the losses of those members of the group that made a loss for the period (as determined by reference to their adjusted profits) from the sum of the profits of those members of the group that made a profit in that period (as determined by reference to their adjusted profits).
Step 4
Subtract the substance based income exclusion for that period for that territory (if any) from the result of Step 3.
Step 5
If the result of Step 4 is nil or less, the total top-up amount for that territory is nil. Otherwise, proceed to Step 6.
Step 6
Multiply the result of Step 1 (which will be a percentage) by the result of Step 4.
(2)
But where those members have a QDT credit for that territory for the accounting period, the total top-up amount is to be reduced in accordance with subsections (4) to (7).
(3)
For the purposes of this Part, standard members of a multinational group in a territory have a “QDT credit” for a territory for an accounting period if qualifying domestic top-up tax (see [F1sections 256 and 256A]) is accrued by one or more of those members in that territory [F2for] that period.
(4)
Where—
(a)
the standard members do not have a collective additional amount under section 206 for the period, and
(b)
the result of Step 6 in subsection (1) is equal to or greater than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in that period,
the total top-up amount is to be reduced by the sum of those amounts.
(5)
Where—
(a)
the standard members do not have a collective additional amount under section 206 for the period, and
(b)
the result of Step 6 in subsection (1) is less than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in the period,
the total top-up amount is to be reduced to nil.
(6)
Where—
(a)
the standard members have a collective additional amount under section 206 for the period, and
(b)
the sum of the result of Step 6 in subsection (1) and that collective additional amount is less than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in the period,
the total top-up amount is to be reduced to nil.
(7)
Where—
(a)
the standard members have a collective additional amount under section 206, and
(b)
the sum of the result of Step 6 in subsection (1) and that collective additional amount is equal to or greater than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in the period,
the total top-up amount is to be reduced by the amount given by multiplying the sum of those amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax by the amount given by dividing the result of Step 6 in subsection (1) by the sum of the result of that step and that collective additional amount.

But where the property is not a short-term rental asset for that period, any carrying value of the operating lease recorded at the start or the end of the period is to be reduced by the right-of-use amount for the property at that time for the purposes of carrying out the calculation in section 197(1).
(4)
In a case where the lessee is a member of the same multinational group as the lessor, the right-of-use amount in relation to the property at the start or the end of the period is the carrying value of the lessee’s right-of-use asset in relation to the property recorded at that time.
(5)
Where the lessee is not a member of the same multinational group as the lessor, the right-of-use amount in relation to the property at the start or end of the period is the undiscounted value of any outstanding payments under the lease at that time.

In determining the value of those outstanding payments—
(a)
apply the accounting standard used in determining the underlying profits of the member,
(b)
include the value of any outstanding payments that would be due under any extension to the lease that would fall to be accounted for in accordance with that standard.

For the purposes of this section, property held for lease is a short-term rental asset in an accounting period if—
(a)
the property was leased regularly during that period to different lessees, and
(b)
the average length of the periods for which it was leased does not exceed 30 days.]

Paragraph 2 of Schedule 15 (annual elections) applies to an election under this section.200
Top-up amounts multiplied by inclusion ratio
(1)
The amount of a top-up amount of a member of a multinational group that is attributed to a responsible member (see section 128) is found by multiplying the top-up amount by the responsible member’s inclusion ratio for the member whose top-up amount it is.
(2)
Where the responsible member’s (“the first responsible member”) interest in the member is through another responsible member, the first responsible member’s top-up amount is to be reduced (but not below nil) by the amount attributed under this section to that other responsible member.201
Inclusion ratio
(1)
A responsible member’s inclusion ratio for a member with a top-up amount (“the relevant member”) is found as follows—
Step 1
Determine the adjusted profits of the relevant member with the top-up amount (in accordance with Chapter 4).
Step 2
Determine how much of those profits are attributable to ownership interests held by [F1individuals and] entities other than the responsible member.
Step 3
Subtract the amount determined under Step 2 from the amount determined under Step 1.
Step 4
The inclusion ratio is given by dividing the amount determined under Step 3 by the amount determined under Step 1.
(2)
The amount of profits of the relevant member attributable to ownership interests held by [F2individuals and] entities other than the responsible member is the amount that would, in hypothetical consolidated financial statements prepared by the responsible member (whether or not it actually prepared consolidated financial statements), have been treated in those statements as attributable to such [F3individuals and] entities under the principles of the authorised accounting standard used, or treated as used (see section 249(1)(d)), in the ultimate parent’s consolidated financial statements.
(3)
For the purposes of determining what that amount would be in those hypothetical consolidated financial statements of the responsible member, use the following assumptions—
(a)
the relevant member’s profits were its adjusted profits as determined in accordance with Chapter 4;
(b)
the responsible member had a controlling interest in the relevant member such that all of its income and expenses were consolidated on a line-by-line basis with those of the responsible member;
(c)
all of the profits of the relevant member were attributable to transactions with persons who are not members of the multinational group;
(d)
all ownership interests that are not directly or indirectly held by the responsible member were held by persons other than members of the multinational group.
(4)
Where the relevant member is a flow-through entity, none of the adjusted profits of the relevant member are to be regarded as attributable to ownership interests held by entities that are not members of the group (and any such entity is to be ignored for the purposes of this section).

Covered taxes balance less than nil when members in a territory have a profit
(1)
This section applies to the standard members of a multinational group in a territory (“the relevant territory”) in an accounting period (“the current period”) if—
(a)
those members do not have a collective loss for the current period, and
(b)
the combined covered tax balance for those members for the current period is less than nil (including as a result of this section or section 205 having applied in a previous accounting period).
(2)
Where this section applies—
(a)
the amount of the combined covered tax balance for the current period is to be added to the combined covered tax balance for the standard members in the relevant territory in the next accounting period in which those members do not have a collective loss (which as the balance for the current period is negative will reduce the combined covered tax balance for that next period), and
(b)
the combined covered tax balance for those members for the current period is to be treated as nil (and as a result of Step 5 in section 132(1) their effective tax rate for the current period will be 0%).
(3)
For the purposes of this section and sections 203 to 205, the standard members of a multinational group in a territory have a collective loss for a period if the result of Step 2 in section 132(1) is nil or less for those members for that period.203
Additional top-up amounts where covered taxes less than expected
(1)
This section applies in an accounting period in relation to standard members of a multinational group in a territory where—
(a)
those members have a collective loss for that period, and
(b)
the combined covered tax balance for those members for the current period is less than nil, and
(c)
the collective negative covered tax balance expressed as a positive number is greater than the amount given by multiplying the collective loss expressed as a positive number by 15% (“the expected covered tax amount”).
(2)
Where this section applies, those members in that territory collectively have an additional top-up amount (a “collective additional amount”) equal to the difference between the expected covered tax amount and the combined covered tax balance.
(3)
Where those members have a QDT credit for the accounting period, the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced in accordance with subsections (4) to (7).
(4)
Where—
(a)
the standard members do not have a collective additional amount under section 206 for the period, and
(b)
the collective additional amount under this section (before reduction by relevant QDT credit) is equal to or greater than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in that period,
the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced by the sum of those accrued amounts.
(5)
Where—
(a)
the standard members do not have a collective additional amount under section 206 for the period, and
(b)
the collective additional amount under this section (before reduction by relevant QDT credit) is less than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in that period,
the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced to nil.
(6)
Where—
(a)
the standard members have a collective additional amount under section 206 for the period, and
(b)
the sum of the collective additional amount under this section (before reduction by relevant QDT credit) and the collective additional amount under section 206 is less than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in that period,
the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced to nil.
(7)
Where—
(a)
the standard members have a collective additional amount under section 206 for the period, and
(b)
the sum of the collective additional amount under this section (before reduction by relevant QDT credit) and the collective additional amount under section 206 is equal to or greater than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in that period,
the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced by the amount given by multiplying the sum of those amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax by the amount given by dividing the collective additional amount under this section by the sum of that collective additional amount and the collective additional amount under section 206.204
Allocation of collective additional amount under section 203 to members
(1)
Where the standard members of a multinational group in a territory have a collective additional amount under section 203, an amount of that amount is to be allocated to each member that has a negative covered tax balance, expressed as a negative number, which is less than the adjusted profits of that member (which may be positive or negative) multiplied by 15%.
(2)
To determine the amount of the collective additional amount to be allocated to each such member, take the following steps—
Step 1
For each such member determine the amount given by subtracting the member’s negative covered tax balance, expressed as a negative number, from its adjusted profits multiplied by 15%.
Step 2
Add together the amounts determined under Step 1.
Step 3
For each such member, divide the amount determined for that member under Step 1 by the result of Step 2.
Step 4
Allocate to each member the amount given by multiplying the result of Step 3 for that member by the collective additional amount.
(3)
For the purposes of this Part, an amount of a collective additional amount allocated to a member of a multinational group under this section is an additional top-up amount.
(4)
Chapter 7 (allocation of top-up amounts to responsible members) applies to an additional top-up amount allocated to a member of a multinational group under this section as it applies to a top-up amount of that member as if the adjusted profits of that member were the amount given by dividing the additional top-up amount by 15%.205
Election to carry forward and reduce collective additional amount
(1)
This section applies where the standard members of a multinational group in a territory (“the relevant territory”) have a collective additional amount [F1under section 203] for an accounting period (“the current period”) and the filing member of the group has elected for this section to apply for that period.
(2)
Where this section applies—
(a)
the qualifying amount of the collective additional amount [F2under section 203] for the current period is to be subtracted from the combined covered tax balance for the standard members of the group in the relevant territory in the next accounting period in which [F3the members of the group in the relevant territory] do not have a collective loss, and
(b)
the collective additional amount [F4under section 203] for the current period is to be reduced by the qualifying amount of that collective additional amount (including to nil where the whole amount is qualifying).
(3)
The amount of the collective additional amount [F5under section 203] that is “qualifying” is the amount given by subtracting the amount of any deferred tax asset deemed to arise under section 217(7) for the period.
(4)
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 15 (annual elections) applies to an election under this section.

Additional top-up amounts where recalculations required
(1)
This section applies to the standard members of a multinational group in an accounting period (“the current period”) in a territory where—
(a)
a recalculation is required in the current period in relation to one or more previous accounting periods (each a “prior period”) as a result of any of the following sections—
(i)
section 163(4);
(ii)
section 184(2);
(iii)
section 217(5);
(iv)
section 219(1), or
(b)
the members have a special additional top-up tax amount under section 192 for the current period.
(2)
Where—
(a)
the sum of the top-up amounts that those members would have for a prior period, determined in accordance with a recalculation required under one of the sections mentioned in subsection (1)(a), is greater than the sum of the top-up amounts those members had for that prior period, or
(b)
this section applies as a result of subsection (1)(b) (whether or not it also applies as a result of subsection (1)(a)),
the members collectively have an additional top-up amount (a “collective additional amount”) under this section for the current period.
(3)
Take the following steps to determine the collective additional amount under this section—
Step 1
Where one or more recalculations are required in accordance with any of the sections mentioned in subsection (1)(a), for each prior period carry out the recalculation or recalculations required in respect of that period to establish the top-up amounts those members would have had for the prior period (taking account of all recalculations required for that period).
Step 2
For each prior period, subtract the sum of the top-up amounts those members had for that prior period from the sum of top-up amounts that those members would have for that period.
Step 3
Add together all of the results of Step 2 that are greater than nil.
Step 4
Where the members have a special additional top-up tax amount under section 192 for the current period, add that amount to the result of Step 2 (which may be nil).
(4)
Where those members have a QDT credit for the accounting period, the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced in accordance with subsections (5) to (8).
(5)
Where—
(a)
the standard members do not have a collective additional amount under section 203 for the period,
(b)
the total top-up amount for the current period for the members for the members’ territory is nil, and
(c)
the collective additional amount under this section (before reduction by relevant QDT credit) is equal to or greater than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in that period,
the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced by the sum of those accrued amounts.
(6)
Where—
(a)
the standard members do not have a collective additional amount under section 203 for the period,
(b)
the total top-up amount for the current period for the standard members in the territory is nil, and
(c)
the collective additional amount under this section (before reduction by relevant QDT credit) is less than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in that period,
the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced to nil.
(7)
Where—
(a)
the standard members have a collective additional amount under section 203 for the period or the total top-up amount for the current period for members for the members’ territory is greater than nil, and
(b)
the sum of the collective additional amount under this section (before reduction by relevant QDT credit), any collective additional amount under section 203 and the total top-up amount for the current period for the members for the member’s territory is less than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in that period,
the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced to nil.
(8)
Where—
(a)
the standard members have a collective additional amount under section 203 for the period or the total top-up amount for the current period for members for the members’ territory is greater than nil, and
(b)
the sum of the collective additional amount under this section (before reduction by relevant QDT credit), any collective additional amount under section 203 and the total top-up amount for the current period for the members for the member’s territory is equal to or greater than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax accrued by those members in that period,
the collective additional amount under this section is to be reduced by the amount given by multiplying the sum of those amounts of qualifying domestic top-up tax by the amount given by dividing the collective additional amount under this section by the sum of that collective additional amount, any collective additional amount under section 203 and the total-up up amount for the current period.207
Allocation of collective additional amounts under section 206 to members
(1)
Where the standard members of a multinational group in a territory have a collective additional amount under section 206 for an accounting period (“the current period”), that amount is to be allocated to those members as follows—
Step 1
Determine the sum of the top-up amounts that those members would have (in prior accounting periods) in accordance with the recalculation, or recalculations, that relate to that collective additional amount.
Step 2
Determine the sum of the top-up amounts that each of those members would have in accordance with the recalculation, or recalculations, that relate to the collective additional amount.
Step 3
For each member where the result of Step 2 is greater than nil, divide that result by the result of step 1.
Step 4
Each such member has an additional top-up amount under this section equal to the amount given by multiplying the collective additional amount by the result of Step 3 for that member.
(2)
Chapter 7 (allocation of top-up amounts to responsible members)—
(a)
applies to an additional top-up amount allocated to a member of a multinational group under this section as it applies to a top-up amount of that member, and
(b)
if the result of Step 2 in section 132(1) in relation to the standard members of the group for the current period is nil or less (those members between them have made a loss), has effect as if the adjusted profits of that member were the amount given by dividing the additional top-up amount by 15%.208
Member joining or leaving multinational group
(1)
Subsection (2) applies to an entity where, in an accounting period (“the transfer period”) of a multinational group, the entity—
(a)
becomes a member of that multinational group (including, where it was previously a member of a different group, as a result of it becoming the ultimate parent of a new group), or
(b)
ceases to be a member of that multinational group.
(2)
The entity is to be treated as a member of that group for the whole of the transfer period (whether or not that results in it being treated as a member of two or more groups) if any portion of its assets, liabilities, income, expenses or cash flows are included on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent for that period.
(3)
But in applying this Part in relation to the entity as a member of the multinational group it has become or ceased to be a member of, only its profits, covered taxes and (where applicable) eligible payroll costs that are taken into account in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent are to be taken account of.
(4)
Any purchase accounting consolidation adjustments arising from the transfer of the ownership interests resulting in an entity becoming a member of a multinational group are to be ignored in determining the adjusted profits and covered tax balance of that entity as a member of that group in the transfer period and in subsequent accounting periods.
(5)
When (where applicable) determining the eligible tangible asset amount of an entity that becomes a member of a multinational group as a member of that group in the transfer period, adjust that amount by multiplying it by the amount given by dividing the number of days in the post-transfer period by the number of days in the transfer period.
(6)
For the purposes of subsection (5) the “post-transfer period” means the period beginning with the day on which the member became or (as the case may be) ceased to be a member of a multinational group and ending with the last day of the transfer period.
(7)
When (where applicable) determining the eligible tangible asset amount of an entity that ceased to be a member of a multinational group as a member of that group in the transfer period, adjust that amount by multiplying it by the amount given by dividing the number of days in the pre-transfer period by the number of days in the transfer period.
(8)
For the purposes of subsection (7) the “pre-transfer period” means the period beginning with the commencement of the transfer period and ending with the day before the day on which the ownership interests were transferred.
(9)
Subsections (10) and (11) apply where an entity that becomes a member of a multinational group (“group A”) as a result of a transfer of direct or indirect ownership interests in it was a member of another multinational group immediately before the transfer (“group B”).
(10)
The amount of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities (which for these purposes does not include a special loss deferred tax asset) of the entity that existed immediately before the transfer to be taken into account in relation to that entity as a member of group A is the amount that would have been taken into account had group A had a controlling interest in the entity at the time the assets and liabilities arose.
(11)
Where a deferred tax liability of the entity was included in the total deferred tax adjustment amount for that member in group B—
(a)
that deferred tax liability is to be deemed to have reversed without the need to reflect the reversal in any calculation made for the purposes of this Part in relation to group B, and
(b)
the deferred tax liability is to be treated as arising in the transfer period for the purpose of determining the total deferred tax adjustment amount for the member in group A,
(c)
any resulting reduction in the covered tax balance of the entity as a member of group A (see sections 182 and 184) is only to have effect in the accounting period in which the deferred tax liability is recaptured.209
When transfer of controlling interest treated as acquisition of assets and liabilities
(1)
This section applies to the acquisition or disposal of a controlling interest in a member of a multinational group where—
(a)
the acquisition or disposal of that controlling interest is treated in the same, or a similar manner, as a transfer of assets and liabilities of the member (rather than ownership interests in it) by—
(i)
in the case of the acquisition or disposal of a controlling interest in an entity which is tax transparent under the law of the territory in which it was created, the territory in which the assets are located, or
(ii)
in any other case, the territory in which the member is located, and
(b)
that territory imposes a covered tax on the seller based on the difference between the tax basis and either the consideration paid in exchange for the controlling interest or the fair value of the assets and liabilities.
(2)
Where this section applies to an acquisition or disposal of a controlling interest in a member of a multinational group, that acquisition or disposal is to be treated as an acquisition or disposal of the assets and liabilities of the member (and accordingly, section 208 will not apply in relation to that transfer).
(3)
Any covered tax arising in relation to the disposal of a controlling interest in a member of a multinational group described in subsection (1)(b) is to included in the covered tax balance of that member.210
Transfer of assets or liabilities from a member of a multinational group
(1)
Where a member of a multinational group transfers assets or liabilities to another entity in the course of a qualifying reorganisation (see section 212), any gain or loss on the transfer is to be excluded from the adjusted profits of the member, except to the extent it is a non-qualifying gain or loss.
(2)
In this section, and in sections 211 and 212, “non-qualifying gain or loss” means a gain or loss of the transferee on the transfer of assets or liabilities, and is the lesser of—
(a)
the amount of that gain or loss that is subject to tax in the territory the transferee is located in, and
(b)
the amount of that gain or loss reflected in the underlying profits accounts of the transferee.211
Transfer of assets or liabilities to a member of a multinational group
[F1(1)
Subsection (1A) applies where there has been a transfer of assets or liabilities to a member of a multinational group and—
(a)
the transfer forms part of a qualifying reorganisation (see section 212), or
(b)
the transferor is a member of the group and—
(i)
the transferee is located in the same territory as the transferor,
(ii)
the transferee and transferor are included in the same tax consolidation group in that territory (within the meaning of section 164(5)), and
(iii)
an election under section 164 (election to exclude intra-group transactions) has effect in relation to those members at the time of the transfer.
(1A)
The value of the assets or liabilities is, for the purpose of determining the adjusted profits of the member, the carrying value of the assets or liabilities in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer.
(1B)
Subsection (1C) applies where there has been a transfer of assets or liabilities to a member of a multinational group and subsection (1A) does not apply.
(1C)
The value of the assets or liabilities is, for the purpose of determining the adjusted profits of the member, the carrying value of the assets or liabilities immediately after the transfer as determined under the accounting standard used in determining the underlying profits of the member for the purposes of this Part and subject to the adjustments to those profits made in accordance with Chapter 4.]
(2)
But subsection (3) applies where—
(a)
[F2subsection (1C) applies in relation] to the transfer,
(b)
the transfer is from another member of the group, and
(c)
neither a gain nor a loss is recorded in the underlying profits accounts of the transferor in respect of that transfer.
(3)
Where this subsection applies the adjusted profits of both the transferor and the transferee are to be adjusted to secure that the transfer is reflected on an arm’s length basis (see section 149(7)).
(4)
Where a member of a multinational group transfers assets or liabilities to another entity in the course of a qualifying reorganisation, and recognises a non-qualifying gain or loss as a result of that transfer—
(a)
that gain or loss, to the extent it is non-qualifying, is to be included in the adjusted profits of the member, and
(b)
where the other entity is a member of a multinational group, the value of the assets or liabilities is, for the purposes of determining the adjusted profits of that member, to be adjusted to exclude the non-qualifying gain or loss in a manner consistent with the tax treatment of the assets or liabilities.

Meaning of “qualifying reorganisation”
(1)
For the purposes of sections 210 and 211, a transfer of assets or liabilities is made in the course of a qualifying reorganisation if the transfer takes place as a result of a merger, de-merger, liquidation or a change in form of an entity, or a similar event, and conditions A, B and C are met.

Investment entity tax transparency election
(1)
The filing member of a multinational group may make an investment entity tax transparency election in relation to a member of the group that is an investment entity (“M”) and a member of the group with ownership interests in that entity (“O”).
(2)
For the purposes of determining whether O has ownership interests in M, only interests that give rise to a share of profits are to be taken into account.
(3)
An investment entity tax transparency election is an election that, for the purposes of sections 168 (underlying profits of transparent entities) and 178 (covered taxes of transparent entities)—
(a)
M is to be treated as a flow-through entity,
(b)
M is to be treated as regarded as tax transparent in the territory of O, and
(c)
O is to be treated as having direct ownership interests in M.
(4)
To determine the percentage of direct ownership interest O is to be treated as having in M, section 246(1) applies as if paragraph (b) were omitted, and for those purposes only interests that give rise in a share of profits are relevant.
(5)
The filing member may only make such an election if—
(a)
an election under section 214 is not in effect in relation to M and O, and
(b)
either—
(i)

Undistributed income amount
(1)
The undistributed income amount for an investment entity for an accounting period is the entity’s adjusted profits for the income period less the amounts referred to in subsection (2).
(2)
The amounts are—

Election where assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value for tax purposes
(1)
This section applies to a member of a multinational group if the filing member has made an election under this section in respect of a relevant tax adjustment made in an accounting period (“the adjustment period”) in relation to that member.
(2)
A “relevant tax adjustment” is an adjustment to the value of assets or liabilities of a member of a multinational group for tax purposes so that they reflect fair value that is required or permitted, under the law of the territory the member is located in, as a result of the occurrence of an event.
(3)
But adjustments made in connection with transfer pricing, or in connection with the sale of assets in the course of carrying on a trade, are not relevant tax adjustments.
(4)
Where this section applies to the member—
(a)
the member has an adjustment amount in respect of each asset or liability that is subject to the relevant adjustment, and
(b)
the value of an asset or liability subject to the relevant adjustment is to be treated, for the purpose of determining the member’s adjusted profits in the adjustment period and subsequent accounting periods, as its fair value immediately after occurrence of the event that caused, or enabled, the adjustment to be made.
(5)
An adjustment amount is to be—
(a)
included in the adjusted profits of the member for the adjustment period, or
(b)
split into 5 equal amounts to be included in the adjusted profits of the member in that period and the subsequent 4 accounting periods.
(6)
But where the adjustment amount is split between those accounting periods and the member leaves the multinational group before the end of the 4th subsequent accounting period, any amount of the adjustment amount that has not been included in the adjusted profits of the member for a previous accounting period is to be included in the adjusted profits of the member for the final accounting period in which it was a member of the group.
(7)
The adjustment amount of a member of a multinational group in respect of an asset or liability subject to a relevant adjustment is the amount given by—
(a)
subtracting the carrying value of the asset or liability immediately before the event that caused, or enabled, the adjustment to be made from the fair value of the asset immediately after occurrence of that event, and
(b)
if that event resulted in a non-qualifying gain or loss (within the meaning given by section 210(2)) for the member—
(i)
in the case of a non-qualifying gain, reducing the result of paragraph (a) by the amount of that gain, or
(ii)
in the case of a non-qualifying loss, increasing the result of paragraph (a) by the amount of that loss.
(8)
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 15 (annual elections) applies to an election under this section.217
Post filing adjustments of covered taxes
(1)
This section applies where, in an accounting period (“the current period”), the liability of a member of a multinational group to covered taxes for a prior accounting period (“the prior period”) as reflected in an information return, overseas information return or self-assessment return (see Schedule 14) has increased or decreased.
(2)
Subsection (4) applies where—
(a)
that liability has increased, or
(b)
that liability has decreased and the decrease is to be treated as insignificant.
(3)
Subsection (5) applies where that liability has decreased, unless the decrease is to be treated as insignificant.
(4)
Where this subsection applies, the covered tax balance of the member for the current period is to be adjusted so as to reflect the amount of that increase or decrease if not already reflected in that balance.
(5)
Where this subsection applies—
(a)
the following are to be recalculated for the prior period to take account of the decrease—
(i)
the effective tax rate for the member and the other members of that group located in the same territory,
(ii)
the top-up amounts that those members would have, and
(iii)
if the liability to covered taxes has decreased because of a reduction of the member’s profits, its adjusted profits but only to the extent necessary to prevent the effective tax rate from decreasing,
(b)
the adjusted profits of those members in subsequent accounting periods are to be adjusted in consequence of the decrease, and the matters referred to in paragraph (a) recalculated accordingly, and
(c)
if the amount of the decrease is reflected in the covered tax balance of the member for the current period, that balance is to be adjusted to exclude it.
(6)
Section 206 applies to a recalculation under subsection (5).
(7)
Where subsection (5) applies in relation to a decrease in liability to covered taxes that arises as a result of the member offsetting a loss in a later accounting period against profits in the prior period, the member is treated for the purposes of this Part—
(a)
as having a deferred tax asset that arises in the later period that is equal to the amount offset multiplied by the lesser of—
(i)
15%, and
(ii)
the tax rate that applied to the profits the amount was offset against, and
(b)
as having used that asset in the prior accounting period.
(8)
For the purposes of this section, a decrease of liability is to be treated as insignificant if—
(a)
[F1the reduction of the covered tax balance of the member for the prior period resulting from] the aggregate decrease in liability for covered taxes for the prior period is less than 1 million euros, and
(b)
the filing member has made an election for decreases in the prior period to be treated as insignificant.
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 15 (annual elections) applies to an election under this subsection.

Effect of rate changes to deferred tax expense
(1)
Where—
(a)
the rate of tax for a member of a multinational group changes in an accounting period,
(b)
the change in rate is to some extent relevant, and
(c)
the effect of the rate change would reduce the member’s covered tax balance in a previous accounting period if the deferred tax expense in that period were recalculated to take account of the change in the rate,
section 217 applies to so much of that reduction as reflects the extent of the change in rate that is relevant as it applies to a decrease in liability to covered taxes.
(2)
Where—
(a)
the rate of tax for a member of a multinational group changed in a previous accounting period,
(b)
the change in rate is to some extent relevant,
(c)
the member’s deferred tax expense for the current accounting period reflects the reversal of deferred tax assets or liabilities that were recognised in an accounting period prior to the rate change at a different rate, and
(d)
the effect of the rate change would increase the member’s covered tax balance in a previous accounting period if the deferred tax expense in that period were recalculated to take account of the change in the rate,
section 217 applies to so much of that increase as reflects the extent of the change in rate that is relevant as it applies to a increase in liability to covered taxes.
(3)
For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), a change of a rate of tax is relevant to the extent that—
(a)
in the case of a rate that is increasing, it reflects an increase from below 15% to the lesser of—
(i)
the rate it is changed to, and
(ii)
15%, and
(b)
in the case of a rate that is decreasing, it reflects a decrease from the lesser of—
(i)
the previous rate, and
(ii)
15%.219
Adjustment where covered taxes not paid
(1)
Where an amount of current tax expense included in the covered tax balance of a member of a multinational group for an accounting period is not paid before the end of the period of 3 years commencing with the last day of that accounting period, the following are to be recalculated excluding that amount—
(a)
the effective tax rate for the member and the other members of that group located in the same territory, and
(b)
the top-up amounts that those members would have.
(2)
But subsection (1) does not apply unless the total of amounts included in the covered tax balance for that accounting period which are not paid before the end of that 3 year period exceeds 1 million euros.
(3)
Section 206 applies to a recalculation under subsection (1).220
Top-up amount of investment entity
(1)
The top-up amount for an accounting period of a member of a multinational group that is an investment entity is, subject to subsection (2), determined by taking the following steps—
Step 1
Determine the adjusted profits (if any) of the entity for the period in accordance with Chapter 4. If the adjusted profits are nil or less, the top-up amount is nil. Otherwise, proceed to Step 2.
Step 2
Adjust the result of Step 1 in accordance with section 223 (to the extent applicable). If the adjusted result is nil, the top-up amount is nil. Otherwise, proceed to Step 3.
Step 3
Determine the substance-based income exclusion for the entity for the period (see section 221).
Step 4
Adjust the result of Step 3 in accordance with section 223 (to the extent applicable).
Step 5
Subtract the result of Step 4 from the result of Step 2. If the result is nil or less, the top-up amount is nil. Otherwise, proceed to Step 6.
Step 6
Determine the investment entity effective tax rate for the territory for the period (see section 222).
Step 7
Subtract the result of Step 6 from 15%. If the result is nil or less, the top-up amount is nil. Otherwise, proceed to Step 8.
Step 8
Multiply the result of Step 7 by the result of Step 5. This is the top-up amount for the entity.
(2)
If an election under section 214 (taxable distribution method election) has been made in relation to the entity, the top-up amount for an accounting period of the entity is the top-up amount determined under subsection (1) added together with any positive undistributed income amount for the entity for the period (see section 215).
(3)
For the purposes of applying Chapter 4 in relation to an investment entity, the references in [F1that Chapter] to “standard members” of a multinational group are instead to members of the multinational group that are investment entities.

Investment entity effective tax rate
The investment entity effective tax rate in a territory for an accounting period is determined by taking the following steps—
Step 1
Determine the adjusted profits made by each of the investment entities in the territory, as determined under Chapter 4 and adjusted under section 223.
Step 2
Subtract the sum of the losses of those investment entities that made a loss in that period from the sum of the profits of those investment entities that made a profit in that period.
Step 3
If the result of Step 2 is nil or less, the investment entity effective tax rate is to be treated as 15%. Otherwise, proceed to Step 4.
Step 4

Adjustments
(1)
In this section each of the following amounts is a “relevant amount”—
(a)
the adjusted profits of an investment entity;
(b)
a substance based income exclusion for an investment entity;
(c)
the covered tax balance of an investment entity.
(2)
An external holding adjustment is to be made to each relevant amount if a person that is not a member of the multinational group has ownership interests in the entity and no election under section 213 (tax transparency election) has been made in relation to the entity.
(3)
An election adjustment is to be made to each relevant amount if an election under section 213 (tax transparency election) or 214 (taxable distribution method election) has been made in relation to the entity.
(4)
Where both an external holding adjustment and an election adjustment are to be made, the election adjustment is to be made after the external holding adjustment (and accordingly is to be an adjustment of a relevant amount as adjusted by the external holding adjustment).
(5)
An adjustment under this section is a reduction of the relevant amount by an adjustment amount.
(6)
An adjustment amount is the adjustment factor for the type of adjustment multiplied by the relevant amount.
(7)
The adjustment factor for an external holding adjustment is the value obtained by dividing—
(a)
the amount of profits of the entity attributable to ownership interests held by persons that are not members of the group, by
(b)
the total amount of profits of the entity determined under Chapter 4.
(8)
The adjustment factor for an election adjustment is the value obtained by dividing—
(a)
the amount of profits of the entity attributable to ownership interests held by the owners in relation to which an election has been made, by
(b)
the total amount of profits of the entity attributable to ownership interests held by members of the group.
(9)
The amount of profits attributable to ownership interests is to be determined in accordance with the method in section 201(2) for determining the amount of profits attributable to the ownership interests referred to in that section.
(10)
Where the covered tax balance of an investment entity includes an amount allocated to it under section 179(1) or 180(3)(a) (allocation of tax imposed under controlled foreign company tax regimes), only so much of its covered tax balance as is not comprised of amounts allocated under those sections is subject to adjustment under this section.224
Additional top-up amounts of investment entities
(1)
Sections 202 to 207 apply in respect of a member of a multinational group that is an investment entity such that the member may have additional top-up amounts.
(2)
For that purpose—
(a)
references in those sections to the standard members of a multinational group in a territory apply as if they were references to the investment entities of the group in the territory;
(b)
the reference in section 202(3) to Step 2 in section 132(1) applies as if it were a reference to Step 2 in section 222;

Attribution of top-up amounts and additional top-up amounts to responsible member
(1)

(2)
Section 200 applies to the attribution of a top-up amount of a member of a multinational group that is an investment entity (“the relevant member”) to a responsible member as it applies to a top-up amount of any other member of the group.
(3)
Section 201 applies for the purpose of determining the inclusion ratio of the responsible member, but—
(a)
in carrying out Step 1 in section 201(1)—
(i)
the adjusted profits of the entity determined in that Step are to be further adjusted in accordance with section 223 (to the extent applicable);
(ii)
if an election under section 214 (taxable distribution method election) has been made in relation to the entity, the adjusted profits of the entity are to be treated as including the undistributed income amount for the entity determined under section 215, and
(b)
subsection (4) of that section applies whether or not the relevant member is a flow-through entity (so that entities that are not members of the group are always ignored).226
Joint venture group
(1)
For the purposes of this Part “joint venture group” means a joint venture parent of a qualifying multinational group and its joint venture subsidiaries (together its “members”).
(2)
An entity is a joint venture parent of a multinational group if—
(a)
the financial results of that entity are reported under the equity method in the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent of that group,
(b)
the ultimate parent holds at least 50% of the ownership interests in the entity,
(c)

the multinational group of which the entity is a member is not composed exclusively of excluded entities, and
(g)
the entity is not a joint venture subsidiary in relation to another joint venture parent.

(4)
Where the main entity of a permanent establishment is a joint venture parent of a multinational group or a joint venture subsidiary, that permanent establishment is to be treated as a separate joint venture subsidiary of the same multinational group joint venture group.227
Application of Part to joint venture groups
(1)
This Part applies to a joint venture group as it applies to a multinational group, but Chapters 3 to 6 and 8 of this Part and [F1Schedules 16 and 16A] apply as if—
(a)
references to the ultimate parent were to the joint venture parent of that group,
(b)
references to a member of a multinational group were to the members of the joint venture group, and.
(c)
references to the filing member were to the filing member of the multinational group whose ultimate parent holds at least 50% of the ownership interests in the joint venture parent.
(2)
For the purposes of the other provisions of this Part, the members of the joint venture group are treated as members of [F2each multinational group] whose ultimate parent directly or indirectly holds at least 50% of the ownership interests in the joint venture parent.
(3)
But no member of the joint venture group is to be regarded as an intermediate parent member or a partially owned parent member of that group.

If—
(a)
a minority owned member (“M”) holds (directly or indirectly) ownership interests in another minority owned member, and

For the purposes of determining the effective tax rate and top-up amounts of a minority owned member that is not a member of a minority subgroup, this Part applies as if references to standard members of a multinational group were instead to that member.229
Multi-parent groups
(1)
Where two or more consolidated groups form part of a multi-parent group—
(a)
those groups (“the constituent groups”) are to be treated as a single multinational group (and accordingly multinational top-up tax will be charged in relation to that single group), and
(b)
the group’s members include (as well as the members who are members as a result of section 126) entities who would not be a member of any of the constituent groups but in which a controlling interest is held by one or more members of the constituent groups,

This Part has effect, in its application to a multi-parent group, as if—
(a)
references (however framed) to the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent were to the multi-parent consolidated financial statements,
(b)
references to the ultimate parent were to all of the ultimate parents of the constituent groups, other than the reference in section 128(3)(b) (responsible members).
(3)

“(b)
any of the ultimate parents of the constituent groups that have ownership interest in the intermediate parent member are not subject to Pillar Two IIR tax, and”.
(4)
Where an intermediate parent member of a multi-parent group is not a member of any of the constituent groups, section 128 has effect in relation to it as if—
(a)
paragraph (b) of subsection (3) were omitted, and
(b)
for subsection (4) there were substituted—
“(4)
Such an intermediate parent member is responsible for each member of the group it has an ownership interest provided the conditions in subsection (4A) are met in relation to that member (“the owned member”).
(4A)
Those conditions are that—
(a)
the owned member is not located in the same territory as the intermediate parent member, and
(b)
any of the ultimate parents of the constituent groups that has an ownership interest in the owned member is not subject to Pillar Two IIR tax.”

(a)
the ultimate parents of the constituent groups are jointly the filing member of the multi-parent group, and

F issues all of those types of interest and all of those types are relevant, divide the result of paragraph (a) by 3, or
(ii)
F only issues 2 of the relevant types of interest or there are only 2 types of interest that are relevant and [F1F] issues both of them, divide the result of paragraph (a) by 2.

Chapters 3 to 6, 8 and 9 of Part 3 apply for the purposes (“domestic entity purposes”) of determining whether a qualifying entity that is not a member of a group has top-up amounts or additional top-up amounts, and the extent of those amounts, as they apply for the purpose of determining the same for the purposes of multinational top-up tax.
(2)
Chapter 3 of that Part has effect for domestic entity purposes as if for section 132 there were substituted—
“132
Effective tax rate
The effective tax rate of a qualifying entity that is not a member of a group is determined as follows—
Step 1
Determine, in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 3, the adjusted profits for that period of that member.
Step 2
If, on determining those adjusted profits, the member has not made a profit, the effective tax rate is to be treated as 15%. Otherwise, proceed to Step 3.
Step 3
Determine the covered tax balance of the member for the period (which may be negative) in accordance with Chapter 5 of Part 3.
Step 4
If that balance is nil the effective tax rate is 0%. Otherwise, proceed to Step 5.
Step 5
Divide the covered tax balance by the adjusted profits.
Step 6
Except where Step 2 or 4 applies, the effective tax rate of the entity is X%, where X (which will be negative if the covered tax balance is negative) is the result of Step 5 multiplied by 100.”
(3)
That Part has effect for domestic entity purposes as if—
(a)
references to “member of a multinational group” (however framed and including references to multiple members) were to “qualifying entity”;
(b)
any reference (however framed) to the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent were to the qualifying financial statements of the entity;

(e)
in section 206 (additional top-up amounts: recalculations), subsections (4) to (8) were omitted.
(4)
Part 3 has effect for those purposes as if the following provisions (which are only relevant to groups or have no relevance for domestic [F2entity] purposes) were omitted—
(a)
in section 134 (underlying profits as determined for statements of ultimate parent), subsections (2) to (9);

Domestic top-up tax to apply from 31 December 2023
This Part has effect in relation to accounting periods commencing on or after 31 December 2023.279
Charge on exceptional generation receipts
(1)
If a qualifying generating undertaking has exceptional generation receipts for a qualifying period, that undertaking is liable to pay a charge equal to 45% of those exceptional receipts.
(2)
The charge is referred to in this Part as the “electricity generator levy”.
(3)
A generating undertaking is “qualifying” in a qualifying period if generation attributed to it under this Part (see section 282, but also sections 294 to 297) for that period exceeds the levy threshold.
(4)
The levy threshold for a qualifying period is—
(a)
where the period is a year, 50,000 megawatt hours, or
(b)
where the period is shorter than a year, that number of megawatt hours multiplied by the amount given by dividing the number of days in the period by 365.
(5)
To determine if a generating undertaking has exceptional generation receipts for a qualifying period and (if so) the amount of those receipts, take the following steps—
Step 1 (attribute generation receipts)
Determine the amount of generation receipts to be attributed to the undertaking for the period in accordance with section 283.
Step 2 (determine the maximum amount of receipts that would not be exceptional)
Multiply the amount of electricity generation (expressed in megawatt hours) attributed to the undertaking for the period (see section 282) by the benchmark amount (see section 281).
Step 3 (determine whether undertaking has receipts that exceed that amount)
Subtract the result of Step 2 from the amount determined under Step 1.
If the result of this Step is nil or less, the undertaking does not have any exceptional generation receipts (otherwise, carry on to Step 4).
Step 4 (subtract allowable costs)
Determine the amount of allowable costs (if any) to be attributed to the undertaking for the period (see section 284) and subtract that amount from the result of Step 3.
If the result of this Step is nil or less, the undertaking does not have any exceptional generation receipts (otherwise, carry on to Step 5).
Step 5 (apply revenue allowance)
Subtract the revenue allowance for the period from the result of Step 4.
Step 6 (result of Step 5 is amount of exceptional generation receipts unless negative)
If the result of Step 5 is nil or less, the undertaking does not have any exceptional generation receipts.
Otherwise, the amount of exceptional generation receipts the undertaking has for the period is the result of Step 5.
(6)
For the purposes of Step 5, the revenue allowance for a generating undertaking for a qualifying period is—
(a)
where the period is a year, £10 million, or
(b)
where the period is shorter than a year, £10 million multiplied by the amount given by dividing the number of days in the period by 365.
(7)
Other provisions in this Part may affect the determination of exceptional generation receipts, including—
(a)
section 293, which contains provision attributing amounts from a joint venture to its participants,
(b)
sections 294 and 295, which contain provision that attributes generation to participants in a joint venture in certain circumstances,
(c)
sections 296 and 297, which contain provision that attributes generation to significant minority shareholders in a generating undertaking in certain circumstances, and
(d)
section 308, which contains anti-avoidance provision.280

(4)
Subsections (5) to (7) apply where 2 financial years fall within a qualifying period.
(5)
Generation attributed to a generating undertaking for that period is to be allocated, on a fair and reasonable basis, between those financial years.
(6)
The calculation in Step 2 of section 279(5) is to be applied separately to the generation allocated to each of those financial years by reference to the benchmark amount for that year.
(7)
Accordingly, the result of that Step is to be the sum of those calculations.
(8)
In this section—
“consumer prices index” means the all items consumer prices index published by the Statistics Board;
“financial year” means a period of twelve months ending with 31st March.282
Attribution of generation
(1)
The following amounts of generation, expressed in megawatt hours, are to be attributed to a generating undertaking for a qualifying period—
(a)
any grid connected electricity generation of a relevant generating station of the undertaking for the period, and
(b)
the amount given by multiplying—
(i)
the amount (if any) of grid connected electricity generation for the period of a relevant generating station that is operated by a qualifying partnership in relation to the undertaking (see section 291), by
(ii)
the qualifying proportion for that period (see that section).
(2)
For the purposes of this Part, a generating station is a generating station of a generating undertaking if—
(a)
in the case of an undertaking that is a company, it is operated by that company otherwise than in partnership with another person, and
(b)
in the case of an undertaking that is a group, it is operated by any member of that group—
(i)
including where the station is operated in partnership and all of the partners are members of the group, but
(ii)
not including where the station is operated in partnership and one or more of the partners are not members of the group.
(3)
“Grid connected electricity generation” of a relevant generating station for a qualifying period means—
(a)
electricity generated by the station in that period for the purpose of giving a supply to any premises or enabling a supply to be so given where that supply would involve the use of a licensed distribution system or a licensed transmission system, and
(b)
electricity that was, at any time, expected to be (but was not) generated by the station in that period for that purpose.
(4)
But for the purposes only of—
(a)
section 279(3) (application of levy threshold), and
(b)
Step 2 in section 279(5) (determination of maximum amount of receipts that would not be exceptional),
ignore any electricity that was expected to be, but was not, generated by a relevant generating station unless the electricity was not generated in connection with an accepted bid to decrease generation under a settlement code.283
Generation receipts
(1)
Where generation is attributed to a generating undertaking under section 282(1) for a qualifying period, generation receipts in respect of that generation are to be attributed to that undertaking for that period.
(2)
In this Part “generation receipts” means amounts that it is fair and reasonable to attribute to generation attributed under section 282(1) (whether or not they are received by, or otherwise arise to the operator of the station) on the basis that the amounts reflect, directly or indirectly, the amount realised (or to be realised) for the wholesale purchase of electricity arising from that generation (whether or not the electricity is actually generated).
(3)
In determining the amounts realised (or to be realised) for the wholesale purchase of electricity the following are, amongst other things, to be taken into account—
(a)
amounts received in accordance with a settlement code in connection with accepted offers to increase generation (but not amounts in connection with accepted bids to decrease generation);
(b)
imbalance charges under such a code;
(c)
payments and receipts under arrangements whose principal purpose is to act as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the price of electricity where those arrangements relate to generation attributed under section 282(1).
(4)
The arrangements referred to in subsection (3)(c) may include arrangements comprising, or that include the use of, options, futures and contracts for difference (within the meaning of Part 7 of CTA 2009).
(5)
The Treasury may by regulations make provision about when amounts can (and cannot) be fairly and reasonably attributed to generation under subsection (2).
(6)
Regulations may also provide that—
(a)
amounts of a specified description are always to be treated as generation receipts;
(b)
amounts of a specified description are never to be treated as generation receipts.
“Specified” means specified in the regulations.
(7)
Subsection (8) applies to generation attributed to a generating undertaking under section 282(1) if—
(a)
provision, within the meaning of Part 4 of TIOPA 2010, has been made or imposed as between two persons by means of a transaction or series of transactions,
(b)
that provision relates to that generation,
(c)
if instead of that provision the arm's length provision had been made or imposed, one of those persons would have an amount that it is fair and reasonable to attribute the generating undertaking in accordance with subsection (2), and
(d)
were that person within the charge to corporation tax, their profits and losses would be calculated (as a result of Part 4 of TIOPA 2010) as if the arm's length provision had been made or imposed instead of the provision actually made or imposed.
(8)
Where this subsection applies to generation attributed to a generating undertaking, generation receipts in respect of it are to be determined as if the arm's length provision had been made or imposed instead of the provision actually made or imposed.
(9)
In this Part “the arm's length provision” has the meaning it has in Part 4 of TIOPA 2010.284
Allowable costs
(1)
“Allowable costs” means—
(a)
exceptional generation fuel costs of relevant generating stations (see section 285),
(b)
exceptional revenue sharing costs in respect of relevant generating stations (see section 286), and
(c)
qualifying electricity purchase costs (see subsection (6)).
(2)
Allowable costs may only be attributed to a generating undertaking for a qualifying period to the extent—
(a)
those costs are fairly and reasonably attributable to generation receipts attributed to the undertaking for the period,
(b)
they reflect expenses of the undertaking (or, in the case of an undertaking that is a group, of one or more of its members), and
(c)
those costs are not already reflected in the determination of the amounts of those receipts.
(3)
Allowable costs are only to be attributed to a generating undertaking if a claim is made for those allowable costs in a company tax return.
In this Part “company tax return” has the same meaning as in Schedule 18 to FA 1998 (see paragraph 3(1) of that Schedule).
(4)
Subsection (5) applies to allowable costs of a person (“the cost holder”) to be attributed to a generating undertaking if—
(a)
the costs arise as a result of provision made or imposed as between the cost holder and another person by means of a transaction or series of transactions, and
(b)
were the cost holder within the charge to corporation tax, the cost holder’s profits and losses would be calculated (as a result of Part 4 of TIOPA 2010) as if the arm's length provision had been made or imposed instead of the provision actually made or imposed.
(5)
Where this subsection applies to allowable costs, the amount of those costs is to be determined as if that arm's length provision had been made or imposed instead of the provision it arose as a result of.
(6)
In this section “qualifying electricity purchase costs” means costs reasonably incurred in the purchase of electricity in order to comply with the terms of an agreement under which it was expected that a relevant generating station will generate but does not do so.285
Exceptional generation fuel costs
(1)
For the purposes of a claim for allowable costs by a generating undertaking, the amount (if any) of “exceptional generation fuel costs” of a relevant generating station for a qualifying period is to be determined as follows—
Step 1
Determine the generation fuel costs for the station for that period.
Step 2
Divide the amount of those costs by the amount of electricity generated by the station in that period (expressed in megawatt hours) that are attributable to a generating undertaking.
Step 3
Determine the baseline fuel cost of the station.
Step 4
If the result of Step 2 is the same as or less than the baseline fuel cost, there are no exceptional generation fuel costs of the station for that period.
Step 5
If the result of Step 2 is greater than the baseline fuel cost, subtract the baseline fuel cost from the result of Step 2.
Step 6
Multiply the amount of electricity generated by the station that is attributable to a generating undertaking in that period by the result of Step 5 to give the amount of exceptional generation fuel costs of the station for that period.
(2)
The “generation fuel costs” of a relevant generating station for a period means costs which, on a fair and reasonable basis, can be directly attributed to the acquisition of fuel used for generating electricity in that period (which may include the costs of transporting such fuel) that is attributable to a generating undertaking.
(3)
The baseline fuel cost of a relevant generating station is the lesser of—
(a)
the average generation fuel costs of the station per megawatt hour for the reference period specified in the claim for allowable costs, determined on a fair and reasonable basis (and which cannot be less than nil), and
(b)
£65 per megawatt hour.
(4)
Subject to subsection (5), the reference period that may be specified in the claim must—
(a)
be a period of at least 12 months in which there is a period of 3 months where the generating station was generating on 50% or more of the days in that 3 month period,
(b)
commence no earlier than 1 January 2017, and
(c)
end no later than 1 March 2020.
(5)
Where a reference period cannot be specified in the claim in accordance with subsection (4) because there is no period of at least 12 months between 1 January 2017 and 1 March 2020 in which there is a period of 3 months where the generating station was generating on 50% or more of the days in that 3 month period—
(a)
a period of 12 months commencing no earlier than 1 January 2017 and ending no later than 1 March 2020 may be specified as the reference period,
(b)
the average generation fuel costs of the station for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) is to be determined as a fair and reasonable estimate of what those costs would have been—
(i)
had the generating station been generating in that period, and
(ii)
had it been generating on a similar basis in that period as it had been generating in the period of 12 months ending with the end of the qualifying period to which the claim relates.
(6)
Where a generating station uses more than one type of fuel, a generating undertaking making a claim for allowable costs in respect of the exceptional fuel costs of that station may calculate the exceptional generation fuel costs in relation to each type of fuel separately, and may specify different reference periods for those calculations.
(7)
Where a generating undertaking makes a claim for allowable costs in respect of exceptional generation fuel costs of two or more generating stations that use the same type of fuel, the same reference period must be specified in relation to the calculation of exceptional generation costs in relation to fuel of the same type.286
Exceptional revenue sharing costs
(1)
Subsection (2) applies for the purposes of determining the amount of allowable costs that may be claimed by a generating undertaking in respect of exceptional revenue sharing costs.
(2)
Take the following steps to determine the amount (if any) that can be claimed for a qualifying period—
Step 1
Determine if there are any relevant generating stations whose generation has been attributed to the undertaking in relation to which there are qualifying arrangements under which payments are made to a third party in relation to the undertaking by reference to—
(a)
the price received for generation by that station, or
(b)
the wholesale price of electricity.
Step 2
Determine the amounts paid, in respect of each of those arrangements.
Step 3
In relation to each such payment, determine the amount that would have been paid if the price received for generation by the station in question and the wholesale price of electricity had been the benchmark amount and subtract that amount from the amount actually paid.
Step 4
Add together the results of Step 3.
If the result of Step 3 is nil or less the generating undertaking, no amount can be claimed.
If the result of Step 3 is more than nil, that amount can be claimed (to the extent it is fairly and reasonably attributable to generation receipts attributed to the undertaking).
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2), arrangements are “qualifying” if they are arrangements under which fuel for generating electricity is acquired and the requirement to make payments under the arrangements relates to that acquisition.
(4)
Where the arrangements provide for some or all of the cost of paying the levy to be passed to the third party (whether by way of reduction of payments or otherwise) no amount of allowable costs in relation to the arrangements may be claimed unless subsection (6) applies.
(5)
Subsection (6) applies where the arrangements provide for a fixed proportion of the cost of paying the levy to be passed to the third party.
(6)
Where this subsection applies, the proportion of the amount calculated under subsection (2) that is equal to the proportion of the costs of paying the levy that are not passed to the third party may be claimed.
(7)
In this section—
“third party”, in relation to a generating undertaking, means a person that is not a significant equity holder in—
(a)
where the undertaking is not a group, the undertaking, or
(b)
where the undertaking is a group, any member of the group;
a person (“P”), other than a member of a group of companies, is a “significant equity holder” in a company (“C”) if—
(a)
P is beneficially entitled to 20% or more of any profits available for distribution to equity holders of C,
(b)
P would be beneficially entitled to 20% or more of any assets of C available for distribution to its equity holders on a winding-up, or
(c)
at least 20% of C‘s ordinary share capital is owned directly or indirectly by P;
a member of a group of companies is a “significant equity holder” in a company (“C”) if—
(a)
members of the group between them are beneficially entitled to 20% or more of any profits available for distribution to equity holders of C,
(b)
members of the group between them would be beneficially entitled to 20% or more of any assets of C available for distribution to its equity holders on a winding-up, or
(c)
at least 20% of C‘s ordinary share capital is owned directly or indirectly by members of the group.287
Groups
(1)
For the purposes of this Part, the following form a “group”—
(a)
a company that is not a 75% subsidiary of any other company, and
(b)
every company that is a 75% subsidiary—
(i)
of that company,
(ii)
of a 75% subsidiary of that company, or
(iii)
of a 75% subsidiary of a 75% subsidiary of that company, and so on.
(2)
The company in a group that is not a 75% subsidiary of any other company is the “principal member” of the group.
(3)
Every other member of the group is a “subsidiary member”.
(4)
A company (“B”) is a “75% subsidiary” of another company (“A”) if—
(a)
A is beneficially entitled to 75% or more of any profits available for distribution to equity holders of B,
(b)
A would be beneficially entitled to 75% or more of any assets of B available for distribution to its equity holders on a winding-up, or
(c)
at least 75% of B’s ordinary share capital is owned directly or indirectly by A.
(5)
Where as a result of the application of each of paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (4) a company would (ignoring this paragraph) be a member of more than one group, that company is to be treated as only being a 75% subsidiary of the first company it is a subsidiary of applying the rules in those paragraphs in order (starting with paragraph (a)).
(6)
If at any time a company that is a generating undertaking becomes a member of a group that is a generating undertaking (including a group that becomes a generating undertaking as a result of that company becoming a member), the final qualifying period of the company ends at that time.
(7)
If at any time a group ceases to be a group as a result of the principal member becoming a 75% subsidiary of another group, the final qualifying period of the group ends at that time.288
Lead member of a group and its qualifying periods
(1)
For the purposes of section 280(2) (meaning of qualifying period), the reference to an accounting period of a generating undertaking that is a group means an accounting period of its lead member.
(2)
Take the following steps in order to identify the lead member of the group (stopping at the first step under which a member of the group is identified as the lead member)—
Step 1
If there is a member of the group that—
(a)
is within the charge to corporation tax, and
(b)
is nominated for the purposes of this section,
that member is the lead member of the group.
Step 2
If the principal member of the group is within the charge to corporation tax, it is the lead member of the group.
Step 3
If—
(a)
there is a member of the group that—
(i)
is within the charge to corporation tax, and
(ii)
has no 75% parent within the charge to corporation tax, and
(b)
there is no other member of the group falling within paragraph (a),
that member is the lead member of the group.
Step 4
If there is more than one member falling within paragraph (a) of Step 3, the lead member is the member falling within that paragraph to which the greatest amount of generation would be attributed under section 282(1) in the period of 12 months ending with the later of 31 December 2022 and the beginning of the first qualifying period in which the group is a qualifying generating undertaking if—
(a)
each such member were a generating undertaking, and
(b)
that period of 12 months were a qualifying period.
Step 5
If none of the preceding steps identifies a lead member, the principal member of the group (who will not be within the charge to corporation tax) is the lead member of the group.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2), a company (“P”) is a 75% parent of another company if that other company is a 75% subsidiary—
(a)
of P,
(b)
of a 75% subsidiary of P, or
(c)
of a 75% subsidiary of a 75% subsidiary of P, and so on.
(4)
A nomination of a member of a group as the lead member of the group—
(a)
is to be made by the member of the group that, ignoring Step 1 in subsection (2), would be the lead member of the group (“the nominating member”),
(b)
must be made by notice to HMRC,
(c)
must specify when it takes effect, which must be no earlier than the commencement of the qualifying period in which it is made, and
(d)
has effect until—
(i)
a further nomination takes effect,
(ii)
it is revoked, or
(iii)
the nominated member leaves the group.
(5)
The revocation of a nomination of a member of a group as the lead member—
(a)
is to be made by the member of the group that, ignoring Step 1 in subsection (2), would be the lead member of the group,
(b)
must be made by notice to HMRC, and
(c)
must specify when it takes effect, which must be no earlier than the commencement of the qualifying period in which it is made.
(6)
Where a company becomes lead member of a group during a qualifying period, and that period is not the same as an accounting period of the new lead member—
(a)
the qualifying period ends, and
(b)
a qualifying period commences that ends with the end of the current accounting period of the new lead member.289
Liability of members of groups
Where a generating undertaking that is a group is liable to an amount of electricity generator levy—
(a)
the lead member is liable to pay that amount, and
(b)
every other member is jointly and severally liable for that amount.290
Election for members with significant minority shareholding to pay levy
(1)
This section applies where—
(a)
a generating undertaking that is a group is liable to an amount of electricity generator levy for a qualifying period,
(b)
a subsidiary member of that group (“the relevant member”) has, at any time in that period, at least one significant minority shareholder,
(c)
some, or all, of that amount is attributable, on a fair and reasonable basis, to the activities of the relevant member and, if it has one or more relevant subsidiaries, those relevant subsidiaries.
(2)
Where this section applies, the lead member of the group may elect that so much of the amount as is attributable to the activities of the relevant member and (where it has one or more relevant subsidiaries) its relevant subsidiaries must be paid by that member.
(3)
But the other members of the group are jointly and severally liable for that amount.
(4)
An election under this section in respect of an amount of electricity generator levy for a qualifying period must be made no later than 9 months after the end of that period.
(5)
For the purposes of this Part—
(a)
a person (“P”) is a significant minority shareholder in a subsidiary member of a group (“S”) if P is not a member of the group and—
(i)
P is beneficially entitled to 10% or more of any profits available for distribution to equity holders of S,
(ii)
P would be beneficially entitled to 10% or more of any assets of S available for distribution to its equity holders on a winding-up, or
(iii)
at least 10% of S‘s ordinary share capital is owned by P, and
(b)
a group of companies (other than the group S is a member of) is a significant minority shareholder in S if—
(i)
members of the group are, between them, beneficially entitled to 10% or more of any profits available for distribution to equity holders of S,
(ii)
members of the group between them would be beneficially entitled to 10% or more of any assets of S available for distribution to its equity holders on a winding-up, or
(iii)
at least 10% of S‘s ordinary share capital is owned by members of the group.
(6)
For the purposes of this section and sections 296 and 297, a company is a relevant subsidiary of another company if it is a 75% subsidiary of—
(a)
that other company,
(b)
a 75% subsidiary of that other company, or
(c)
a 75% subsidiary of a 75% subsidiary of that other company, and so on.291
Qualifying partnerships
(1)
A “qualifying partnership”, in relation to a generating undertaking, means a partnership that operates a relevant generating station whose partners include—
(a)
in the case of a generating undertaking that is a company, that company, or
(b)
in the case of a generating undertaking that is a group, at least one partner who is not a member of the group and at least one partner who is a member of the group.
(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1) of section 282, the qualifying proportion for a qualifying period in relation to a generating undertaking that is a company and a qualifying partnership in relation to that undertaking is the proportion of the partnership’s profits represented by the undertaking’s share of those profits.
(3)
For the purposes of that subsection, the qualifying proportion for a qualifying period in relation to a generating undertaking that is a group and a qualifying partnership in relation to that undertaking is the proportion of the partnership’s profits represented by the sum of the shares of those profits of each partner that is a member of the undertaking.
(4)
Part 17 of CTA 2009 (partnerships) applies for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of corporation tax.292
Qualifying joint ventures
(1)
For the purposes of this Part a company (“C”) is a “qualifying joint venture” if—
(a)
C is not a member of a group other than a group of which it is the principal member, and
(b)
there are five or fewer persons who between them—
(i)
hold 75% or more of C’s ordinary share capital, or
(ii)
in a case where C does not have ordinary share capital, are beneficially entitled to 75% or more of C's profits available for distribution to equity holders of C.
(2)
In determining whether there are five or fewer such persons as are mentioned in subsection (1)(b), the members of a group are treated as if they were a single company.
(3)
A company (“P”) that is not a member of a group is a participant in a qualifying joint venture (“V”) if—
(a)
P holds 10% or more of V’s ordinary share capital, or
(b)
in a case where V does not have ordinary share capital, P is beneficially entitled to 10% or more of V's profits available for distribution to equity holders of V.
(4)
A group of companies is a participant in a qualifying joint venture (“V”) if—
(a)
a member of that group, or two or more members between them, hold 10% or more of V’s ordinary share capital, or
(b)
in a case where V does not have ordinary share capital, a member of the group is, or two or more members between them are, beneficially entitled to 10% or more of V's profits available for distribution to equity holders of V.
(5)
Where a participant in a qualifying joint venture is not a generating undertaking, the participant is to be treated as a generating undertaking for the purposes of this Part.293
Non-chargeable amounts of joint venture to be attributed to participants
(1)
Subsection (3) applies where the result of Step 4 in section 279(5) for a joint venture undertaking is greater than nil for a qualifying period.
(2)
For the purposes of this Part “joint venture undertaking” means a generating undertaking—
(a)
that is a qualifying joint venture, or
(b)
that is a group whose principal member is a qualifying joint venture.
(3)
The appropriate proportion of the non-chargeable amount in relation to the joint venture undertaking is to be added to the result of Step 4 in section 279(5) for each generating undertaking that is a participant in the qualifying joint venture (“the JV”) that comprises, or is the principal member of, the joint venture undertaking (and where Step 4 would not otherwise have been reached as a result of the second sentence of Step 3, ignore that sentence).
(4)
Where the qualifying period of the joint venture undertaking corresponds to a qualifying period of a participant of the JV, the whole of the appropriate proportion of the non-chargeable amount is to be added to the result of Step 4 for the participant for that period.
Otherwise, the appropriate proportion is to be apportioned, on a fair and reasonable basis, between the qualifying periods of the participant in which the qualifying period of the joint venture undertaking falls.
(5)
The non-chargeable amount for a qualifying period of the joint venture undertaking is so much of the result of Step 4 in section 279(5) for that period as is reduced as a result of Step 5 of that section.
(6)
To determine the appropriate proportion of the participants in the JV for a qualifying period of the joint venture undertaking take the following steps—
Step 1
The generation receipts and allowable costs attributed to the joint venture undertaking for the period are to be allocated to the participants in the JV in proportion to the proportional interest each has in the JV at the time of the generation to which the receipts or costs relate.
Step 2
In respect of each participant, subtract those allocated allowable costs from those allocated generation receipts.
If the result of this Step is less than nil for any of the participants, the appropriate proportion for that participant is nil.
Step 3
The appropriate proportion for any other participant is the amount given by dividing—
(a)
the result of Step 2 in respect of that participant, by
(b)
the result of Step 4 in section 279(5) for the joint venture undertaking—
(i)
ignoring any amounts added to the result of that Step in accordance with subsection (3), and
(ii)
where the result of Step 2 for one or more of the participants is less than nil, increased by the sum of those results (each expressed as a positive number).
(7)
The proportional interest of a participant (“P”) in the JV at any time is—
(a)
the percentage of the JV’s ordinary share capital held—
(i)
where P is a generating undertaking which is a company, by P, or
(ii)
where P is a generating undertaking which is a group, by members of P, or
(b)
in a case where the JV does not have ordinary share capital, the percentage of the JV’s profits available for distribution to equity holders of the JV—
(i)
where P is a generating undertaking which is a company, to which P is beneficially entitled, or
(ii)
where P is a generating undertaking which is a group, to which members of P are beneficially entitled.
(8)
Where the appropriate proportion of the non-chargeable amount is required to be added to the result of Step 4 in section 279(5) for a generating undertaking that is not “qualifying” (see section 279(3)) in the qualifying period in which it is to be added, that undertaking is to be treated as qualifying for that period.294
Generation acquired and supplied by JV participants
(1)
Subsection (3) applies to generation if —
(a)
the generation is attributed to a joint venture undertaking, other than in accordance with this section or sections 295 to 297,
(b)
it is supplied, directly or indirectly, to a generating undertaking (“Q”) that is a participant in the joint venture (“the JV”) that comprises, or is the principal member of, the joint venture undertaking, and
(c)
it is subsequently the subject of a wholesale purchase of electricity from Q.
(2)
Where the generation attributed to the joint venture undertaking is generation falling within section 282(3)(b) (generation expected to be generated which was not generated), reference in subsection (1) to supply or purchase is to any supply or purchase that was expected in consequence of that generation having occurred.
(3)
Where this subsection applies to generation—
(a)
the generation is to be attributed to Q (as well as to the joint venture undertaking),
(b)
in determining the amount of generation receipts to be attributed to the joint venture undertaking under section 283 in respect of that generation, do not take account of the transaction described in subsection (1)(c),
(c)
the generation attributed to Q as a result of paragraph (a) is to be attributed to Q for the qualifying period of Q in which the generation occurred,
(d)
subject to paragraph (f), the generation attributed to Q as a result of paragraph (a) is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as if it had been attributed under section 282(1),
(e)
in determining the amount of generation receipts to be attributed to Q under section 283 in respect of generation attributed as a result of paragraph (a), take account of the costs of the transaction under which the generation so attributed was acquired or was expected to be acquired, and
(f)
in determining the exceptional generation receipts of Q for a qualifying period of Q under section 279(5), any generation attributed to Q for that period as a result of paragraph (a) is to be ignored for the purposes of Step 2 (which may result in the result of that Step being nil).
(4)
But the amount generation that is to be attributed to Q in a qualifying period of Q under this section is not to exceed the amount of generation attributed to the joint venture undertaking in respect of that same period multiplied by the relevant proportion.
(5)
The “relevant proportion” for the purposes of subsection (4) and section 295(3) is—
(a)
the percentage of the JV’s ordinary share capital held—
(i)
where Q is a generating undertaking which is a company, by Q, or
(ii)
where Q is a generating undertaking which is a group, by members of Q, or
(b)
in a case where the JV does not have ordinary share capital, the percentage of the JV’s profits available for distribution to equity holders of the JV—
(i)
where Q is a generating undertaking which is a company, to which Q is beneficially entitled, or
(ii)
where Q is a generating undertaking which is a group, to which members of Q are beneficially entitled.295
Arrangements that reflect receipts (JV participants)
(1)
Subsection (2) applies to generation if—
(a)
the generation is attributed to a joint venture undertaking, other than in accordance with this section or sections 294, 296 or 297,
(b)
a participant (“Q”) in the joint venture (“the JV”) that comprises, or is the principal member of, the joint venture undertaking is party to arrangements that result in amounts arising by reference to the generation,
(c)
those amounts would, if the joint venture undertaking, or a member of it, were party to those arrangements, be taken into account in determining the generation receipts of the joint venture undertaking, and
(d)
the generation—
(i)
is not supplied (directly or indirectly) to Q, or
(ii)
in the case of generation falling within section 282(3)(b) (generation expected to be generated which was not generated), was not expected to be supplied (directly or indirectly) to Q.
(2)
Where this subsection applies to generation—
(a)
the generation is to be attributed to Q (as well as to the joint venture undertaking),
(b)
the generation attributed to Q as a result of paragraph (a) is to be attributed to Q for the qualifying period of Q in which the generation occurred,
(c)
subject to paragraph (d), the generation attributed to Q as a result of paragraph (a) is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as if it had been attributed under section 282(1),
(d)
in determining the exceptional generation receipts of Q for a qualifying period of Q under section 279(5)—
(e)
any generation attributed to Q for that period as a result of paragraph (a) is to be ignored for the purposes of Step 2 (which may result in the result of that Step being nil).
(3)
But amount of generation that is to be attributed to Q in a qualifying period of Q under this section is not to exceed the amount given by subtracting—
(a)
the amount of generation attributed to Q in that period under section 294, from
(b)
the amount of generation attributed to the joint venture undertaking in respect of that same period multiplied by the relevant proportion (see section 294(5)).296
Generation acquired and supplied by significant minority shareholders
(1)
Subsection (3) applies to generation if—
(a)
a subsidiary member (“A”) of a generating undertaking that is a group (“U”) has a significant minority shareholder that is a company or group,
(b)
the generation is generation by a relevant generating station operated by A or a relevant subsidiary of A (see section 290(6)),
(c)
the generation is supplied, directly or indirectly, to a significant minority shareholder (“M”) in A that is a company or a group, and
(d)
the generation is subsequently the subject of a wholesale purchase of electricity from M.
(2)
Where the generation falls within section 282(3)(b) (generation expected to be generated which was not generated), reference in subsection (1) to supply or purchase is to any supply or purchase that was expected in consequence of that generation having occurred.
(3)
Where this subsection applies to generation—
(a)
the generation is to be attributed to M (as well as to U),
(b)
in determining the amount of generation receipts to be attributed to U under section 283 in respect of the generation, do not take account of the transaction described in subsection (1)(d),
(c)
the generation attributed to M as a result of paragraph (a) is to be attributed to M for the qualifying period of M in which the generation occurred,
(d)
subject to paragraph (f), the generation attributed to M as a result of paragraph (a) is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as if it had been attributed under section 282(1),
(e)
in determining the amount of generation receipts to be attributed to M under section 283 in respect of generation attributed as a result of paragraph (a), take account of the costs of the transaction under which the generation so attributed was acquired or was expected to be acquired, and
(f)
in determining the exceptional generation receipts of M for a qualifying period of M under section 279(5), any generation attributed to M for that period as a result of paragraph (a) is to be ignored for the purposes of Step 2 (which may result in the result of that Step being nil).
(4)
Where the generation is generation by a relevant generating station operated in partnership and at least one of the partners is neither A nor a relevant subsidiary of A, only the qualifying proportion of that generation is to be attributed to M under subsection (3)(a).
(5)
For the purposes of this section and section 297, “the qualifying proportion” is the proportion of generation that is equal to the proportion of the partnership’s profits represented by the sum of A’s share of the partnership’s profits and the shares of those profits of any relevant subsidiaries of A (and Part 17 of CTA 2009 applies for the purposes of this subsection as it applies for the purposes of corporation tax).
(6)
But the generation that is to be attributed to M in a qualifying period of M is not to exceed the amount of generation that is attributable on a fair and reasonable basis to the activities of A and (where it has one or more relevant subsidiaries) its relevant subsidiaries in that same period multiplied by the relevant proportion.
(7)
The “relevant proportion” for the purposes of subsection (6) and section 297(4)(b) is—
(a)
the percentage of A’s ordinary share capital held—
(i)
where M is a generating undertaking which is a company, by M, or
(ii)
where M is a generating undertaking which is a group, by members of M, or
(b)
in a case where A does not have ordinary share capital, the percentage of A’s profits available for distribution to equity holders of A—
(i)
where M is a generating undertaking which is a company, to which M is beneficially entitled, or
(ii)
where M is a generating undertaking which is a group, to which members of M are beneficially entitled.
(8)
Where M is not a generating undertaking, M is to be treated as a generating undertaking for the purposes of this Part.297
Arrangements that reflect receipts (significant minority shareholders)
(1)
Subsection (2) applies to generation if—
(a)
a subsidiary member (“A”) of a generating undertaking that is a group (“U”) has a significant minority shareholder that is a company or group,
(b)
the generation is generation by a relevant generating station operated by A or a relevant subsidiary of A (see section 290(6)),
(c)
a significant minority shareholder (“M”) in A that is a company or a group is party to arrangements that result in amounts arising by reference to the generation,
(d)
those amounts would be taken into account in determining the generation receipts of U if A or a relevant subsidiary of A (whichever operates the station) were party to the arrangements, and
(e)
the generation—
(i)
is not supplied (directly or indirectly) to M, or
(ii)
in the case of generation falling within section 282(3)(b) (generation expected to be generated which was not generated), was not expected to be supplied (directly or indirectly) to M.
(2)
Where this subsection applies to generation—
(a)
the generation is to be attributed to M (as well as to U),
(b)
the generation attributed to M as a result of paragraph (a) is to be attributed to M for the qualifying period of M in which the generation occurred,
(c)
subject to paragraph (d), the generation attributed to M as a result of paragraph (a) is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as if it had been attributed under section 282(1),
(d)
in determining the exceptional generation receipts of M for a qualifying period of M under section 279(5), any generation attributed to M for that period as a result of paragraph (a) is to be ignored for the purposes of Step 2 (which may result in the result of that Step being nil).
(3)
Where the generation is generation by a relevant generating station operated in partnership and at least one of the partners is neither A nor a relevant subsidiary of A, only the qualifying proportion of that generation (see section 294(4)) is to be attributed to M under subsection (2)(a).
(4)
But the amount of generation that is to be attributed to M in a qualifying period of M is not to exceed the amount given by subtracting—
(a)
the amount of generation attributed to M in that period under section 296, from
(b)
the amount of generation that is attributable on a fair and reasonable basis to the activities of A and (where it has one or more relevant subsidiaries) its relevant subsidiaries multiplied by the relevant proportion (see section 296(7)).
(5)
Where M is not a generating undertaking, M is to be treated as a generating undertaking for the purposes of this Part.298
Surrender of shortfalls
(1)
This section applies where in an overlap period for two related generating undertakings—
(a)
one of those undertakings (“A”) has a shortfall amount for the overlap period, and
(b)
the other undertaking (“B”) has exceptional generation receipts for the overlap period.
(2)
To determine if an undertaking has a shortfall amount or exceptional generation receipts for an overlap period, carry out all of the steps in section 279(5) as if the period were a qualifying period, including steps that would normally be ignored because a result of nil or less has already been found.
(3)
If the result of Step 5 is less than nil, that result (expressed as a positive number) is a shortfall amount.
(4)
Where this section applies, an amount of the shortfall amount of A may be surrendered to B.
(5)
Section 299 sets out how much of the shortfall amount may be surrendered by A to B.
(6)
Two generating undertakings are related generating undertakings if—
(a)
one is—
(i)
a joint venture undertaking, or
(ii)
a generating undertaking that is a group that has at least one subsidiary member who has at least one significant minority shareholder, and
(b)
the other is a relevant shareholder in the other.
(7)
A generating undertaking (“C”) is a relevant shareholder in another generating undertaking (“D”) if—
(a)
where D is a joint venture undertaking, C is a participant in the joint venture that comprises, or is the principal member of, the joint venture undertaking, or
(b)
where D is a generating undertaking that is a group that has at least one subsidiary member who has at least one significant minority shareholder, C is a significant minority shareholder in a subsidiary member of D.
(8)
In this section “overlap period” in relation to two generating undertakings means—
(a)
where a qualifying period of one of the generating undertakings wholly corresponds with a qualifying period of the other, such a period, and
(b)
where a qualifying period of one generating undertaking does not wholly correspond with a qualifying period of the other, a period—
(i)
that commences at the same time as a qualifying period of one of them, and
(ii)
that ends with the earlier of the end of that qualifying period or the end of the last qualifying period of the other undertaking to commence on or before that qualifying period.299
Amount that may be surrendered and use of that amount
(1)
Subject to subsection (7), the maximum amount of a shortfall amount that may be surrendered by a generating undertaking (“A”) to another (“B”) where A is a relevant shareholder in B, is the lesser of the amounts given by subsections (2) and (3).
(2)
The amount given by this subsection is the amount of the shortfall amount of A that is, on a fair and reasonable basis, referable to A’s interest in the generation attributed to B in the overlap period.
(3)
The amount given by this subsection is the amount of the exceptional generation receipts of B for the shortfall period that is, on a fair and reasonable basis, referable to A’s interest in the generation attributed to B in the overlap period.
(4)
Subject to subsection (7), the maximum amount of a shortfall amount that may be surrendered by a generating undertaking (“C”) to another (“D”) where D is a relevant shareholder in C is the lesser of the amounts given by subsections (5) and (6).
(5)
The amount given by this subsection is the amount of the shortfall amount of C that is, on a fair and reasonable basis, referable to D’s interest in the generation attributed to C in the overlap period.
(6)
The amount given by this subsection is the amount of the exceptional generation receipts of D for the shortfall period that is, on a fair and reasonable basis, referable to D’s interest in the generation attributed to C in the overlap period.
(7)
A generating undertaking may only surrender an amount of a shortfall amount relating to an overlap period if the result of Step 5 in section 279(5) for the undertaking for the qualifying period in which the overlap period falls would not exceed nil if—
(a)
all of the steps in section 279(5) for that qualifying period were carried out, including steps that would normally be ignored because a result of nil or less has already been found,
(b)
the amount surrendered were added to the result of Step 5, and
(c)
all other amounts surrendered for overlap periods falling with that period were added to the result of that Step.
(8)
Where an amount of a shortfall amount has been surrendered to a generating undertaking, that amount is to reduce the result of Step 5 in section 279(5), but not below nil, for the qualifying period in which the overlap period to which the shortfall amount relates falls.
(9)
A surrender of an amount of a shortfall amount is effective only if—
(a)
the generating undertaking which is surrendering the amount has consented to surrender that amount to the other generating undertaking, and
(b)
the other generating undertaking has made a claim to that amount (see section 305).300
Election to treat certain companies as transparent
(1)
A company that is, or is a member of, a generating undertaking may elect that the company is to be treated as transparent while the election is in force.
Section 301 sets out the effect of a company being “treated as transparent”.
(2)
An election under subsection (1)—
(a)
must be made by notice to HMRC;
(b)
must specify the first day on which the election is to have effect, which must be no earlier than 12 months before the day on which the notice is given;
(c)
may only be made if conditions A and B are met.
(3)
Condition A is that—
(a)
the company is a qualifying joint venture that is, or is a member of, a generating undertaking, or
(b)
the company—
(i)
is a subsidiary member of a group that is a generating undertaking, and
(ii)
has at least one significant minority shareholder.
(4)
Condition B is that each shareholder of the company—
(a)
has at least a 10% interest in it,
(b)
is a company, and
(c)
has consented to the making of the election.
(5)
Where two or more members of a group are shareholders of the company, they are to be regarded as a single shareholder (and their interests aggregated) for the purposes of determining whether subsection (4)(a) is met (but each must still consent to the making of the election for condition B to be satisfied).
(6)
For the purposes of this section and section 301—
(a)
a person is a shareholder of a company if—
(i)
in the case of a company that has ordinary share capital, the person holds ordinary share capital of the company, or
(ii)
in the case of a company that does not have ordinary share capital, the person is beneficially entitled to a share of the company’s profits available for distribution to equity holders of it, and
(b)
a shareholder’s interest in a company is—
(i)
in the case of a company that has ordinary share capital, the proportion of the ordinary share capital of the company the shareholder holds, or
(ii)
in the case of a company that does not have ordinary share capital, the proportion of the company’s profits available for distribution to equity holders of it to which the shareholder is beneficially entitled.
(7)
An election under this section has effect from the date specified in accordance with subsection (2)(b) until—
(a)
revoked by the company,
(b)
revoked by HMRC, or
(c)
a person who was not a shareholder of the company at the time the election first took effect becomes a shareholder of the company.
Nothing in this subsection is to be read as preventing a subsequent election being made that commences at any time after the first election ceased to have effect.
(8)
An election may be revoked by the company by notice given to HMRC that specifies the date the election is to cease to have effect, which must be no earlier than 12 months before the day on which the notice of revocation is given.
(9)
An election may be revoked by HMRC by notice given to the company if HMRC considers that the company or its shareholders have not complied with any obligation under this Part.
(10)
A notice under subsection (9)—
(a)
must specify the date from which the revocation has effect (including a date which if specified would result in the election never having effect), and
(b)
must state the reasons for revocation, and
(c)
may be appealed by the company by notice to HMRC.
(11)
An appeal under subsection (10)(c) must be made during the period of 30 days beginning with the date on which the notice under subsection (9) was given.
Further provision about appeals is contained in Part 5 of TMA 1970 (which applies in relation to the electricity generator levy as a result of section 302).301
Effect of company being transparent
(1)
This section applies where a company (“C”) is treated as transparent as a result of an election under section 300.
(2)
C is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as if it were a partnership.
(3)
Its shareholders are to be regarded for those purposes as its partners.
(4)
Each shareholder’s share of the profits of the partnership is equal to its interest in C.
(5)
Where C is a generating undertaking, all generation, generation receipts and allowable costs that would (ignoring this section) be attributed to C in accordance with this Part are to be treated instead as if they resulted from the operation of a generating station operated in partnership by C’s partners.
(6)
Where C is a member of a group that is a generating undertaking, the generation, generation receipts and allowable costs that—
(a)
would (ignoring this section) be attributed to the group in accordance with this Part, and
(b)
are attributable on a fair and reasonable basis to the activities of C,
are to be treated instead as if they resulted from the operation of a generating station operated in partnership by C’s partners.
(7)
Where C is, or is treated as, the only shareholder in another company (“D”), the generation, generation receipts and allowable costs that—
(a)
would (ignoring this section) be attributed, in accordance with this Part, to the group of which D is a member, and
(b)
are attributable on a fair and reasonable basis to the activities of D,
are to be treated instead as if they resulted from the operation of a generating station operated in partnership by C’s partners.
(8)
C is to be treated as the only shareholder in another company if—
(a)
the other company’s only shareholder is—
(i)
a company in which C is the only shareholder,
(ii)
a company in which the only shareholder is a company in which C is the only shareholder, and so on, or
(b)
the other company has more than one shareholder, but each of its shareholders is one of the following—
(i)
C;
(ii)
a company whose only shareholder falls within paragraph (a)(i) or (ii);
(iii)
a company that has more than one shareholder each of which is a company falling with sub-paragraph (i) or (ii) or this sub-paragraph.
(9)
Where a shareholder of a company, or a generating undertaking of which such a shareholder is a member, is liable to an amount of electricity generator levy as a result of this section—
(a)
where the company is a generating undertaking, it is jointly and severally liable to that amount (to the extent it arises as a result of this section), or
(b)
where the company is a member of a generating undertaking that is a group, that undertaking is jointly and severally liable to that amount (to the extent it arises as a result of this section).
(10)
Where—
(a)
a generating undertaking is liable to an amount of electricity generator levy as a result of subsection (9)(a) or (b), and
(b)
the qualifying period (“the chargeable period”) by reference to which that amount was determined does not wholly correspond to a qualifying period of the undertaking,
the amount is to be apportioned, on a fair and reasonable basis, between the qualifying periods of the undertaking in which the chargeable period falls.302
General application of corporation tax administration
(1)
Where a company is liable to an amount of electricity generator levy, that amount may be charged on the company as if it were an amount of corporation tax chargeable on it.
(2)
For the purposes of the collection and management of the electricity generator levy, any provision made by or under an enactment that applies in relation to corporation tax is to apply in relation to the electricity generator levy.
(3)
The following are examples of provision that, as a result of subsection (2), apply in relation to the electricity generator levy—
(a)
provision relating to returns of information and the supply of accounts, statements and reports;
(b)
provision relating to the assessing, collecting and receiving of corporation tax;
(c)
provision conferring or regulating a right of appeal;
(d)
provision concerning administration, penalties or interest on unpaid amounts of corporation tax;
(e)
provision about the priority of amounts owed to the Commissioners for His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in cases of insolvency under the law of any part of the United Kingdom.
(4)
Accordingly—
(a)
TMA 1970 is to have effect as if any reference to corporation tax included amounts of electricity generator levy that a company is chargeable to, and
(b)
Paragraph 1 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 (company tax returns, assessments and related matters) has effect as if—
(i)
the “and” at the end of the paragraph beginning “section 33 of the Finance Act 2022” were omitted, and
(ii)
at the end there were inserted “and,
section 302(1) of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023.”
(5)
Subsections (1) to (4) are subject to—
(a)
any other provision made by or under this Part, and
(b)
any necessary modifications.
(6)
The Treasury may by regulations make the following provision—
(a)
provision that disapplies any provision so far as it would otherwise, as a result of subsection (2), apply in relation to the electricity generator levy;
(b)
provision modifying the application of any such provision in relation to the electricity generator levy;
(c)
provision about (including provision modifying) the application of any provision of the Tax Acts (that would not otherwise apply to the electricity generator levy as a result of subsection (2)) in relation to the levy.303
Company tax returns
(1)
Where a generating undertaking that is a company is a qualifying generating undertaking for a qualifying period, it must include a statement of the matters mentioned in subsection (4) in its company tax return for the first accounting period that ends on or after the day on which the qualifying period ends (and if it would not otherwise be required to make a company tax return for that period, it must make one).
(2)
Where a generating undertaking that is a group is a qualifying generating undertaking for a qualifying period, the lead member in that period must include a statement of the matters mentioned in subsection (4) in its company tax return for the first accounting period that ends on or after the day on which the qualifying period ends (and if it would not otherwise be required to make a company tax return for that accounting period it must make one).
(3)
But subsections (1) and (2) do not apply in relation to a qualifying generating undertaking for a qualifying period if it is reasonable to assume that the result of Step 5 in section 279(5) for that period would be significantly less than nil.
(4)
The matters that must be stated are as follows—
(a)
the amount of generation attributed to the generating undertaking for the qualifying period under this Part,
(b)
the amount of generation receipts attributed to that undertaking for that period under section 283,
(c)
the amount of any allowable costs attributed to that undertaking for that period under section 284,
(d)
the amount of the undertaking’s revenue allowance for that period,
(e)
in the case of a generating undertaking that is a group, any amount of electricity generator levy that a member of that group must pay as a result of an election under section 290.
(5)
Where the lead member of a generating undertaking that is a group fails to comply with the obligation in subsection (2) in relation to a qualifying period, an officer of Revenue and Customs may by notice require another member of the group to make or amend a company tax return that includes the matters mentioned in subsection (4).
(6)
Nothing in this section is to be taken to limit the things which must be included in a company tax return as a result of section 302(4)(b) (which has the effect of treating the electricity generator levy as tax for the purposes of company tax returns).
(7)
Schedule 18 to FA 1998 (company tax returns etc.) applies in relation to a company required to make, or amend, a company tax return as a result of this section as if, in paragraph 8(1) of that Schedule (calculation of tax payable), at the end there were inserted—
“Sixth step
Add any amount of electricity generator levy the company is liable to in respect of that accounting period under Part 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023.”
(8)
For the purposes of that modification, a company is liable to an amount of electricity generator levy in respect of an accounting period if the company tax return for that period must, as a result of this section, include a statement of the matters mentioned in subsection (4) in relation to the qualifying period to which that amount relates.304
Requirement to provide information about payments
(1)
This section applies if—
(a)
an amount of electricity generator levy is chargeable on a company as if it were an amount of corporation tax, and
(b)
a payment is made (whether or not by the company) that is wholly or partly in respect of that sum.
(2)
The responsible company must give notice to an officer of Revenue and Customs, on or before the date the payment is made, of the amount of the payment that is in respect of that sum.
(3)
The “responsible company” is—
(a)
in the case of an amount of electricity generator levy to which a generating undertaking that is a company is liable, that company, or
(b)
in the case of an amount of electricity generator levy to which a generating undertaking that is a group is liable, the lead member of that group.
(4)
The requirement in subsection (2) is to be treated, for the purposes of Part 7 of Schedule 36 to FA 2008 (information and inspection powers: penalties), as a requirement in an information notice.
(5)
This section is subject to any provision to the contrary in regulations under section 59E of TMA 1970 (further provision as to when corporation tax is due and payable).305
Claims to shortfall amounts
(1)
Part 8 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 applies to a claim to a shortfall amount under section 299 as it applies to a claim for group relief under Part 5 of CTA 2010.
(2)
That Part has effect for the purposes of a claim to a shortfall amount as if—
(a)
references to “relief” were to the relief from electricity generator levy given by claiming a shortfall amount,
(b)
references to “accounting period” were to “qualifying period”, except where the context otherwise requires (for example, in references to the company tax return for the accounting period),
(c)
references to “company” (apart from in “company tax return”) were to “generating undertaking” (and if the context requires in the case of a generating undertaking that is a group, references were to the lead member of the group),
(d)
in paragraph 68, sub-paragraphs (3) to (8) were omitted,
(e)
in paragraph 69(3), in the first step, “under Part 5 or (as the case may be ) Part 5A of the Corporation Tax Act 2010” were omitted,

(ii)
sub-paragraphs (2), (5) and (6) were omitted,
(g)
in paragraph 71—

“(e)
the overlap period to which the shortfall amount relates.”, and
(ii)
sub-paragraph (1A) were omitted,
(h)
paragraphs 71A, 72, 75A, 77 and 77A were omitted, and
(i)
such other modifications as are necessary were made.306
Application of Part 5A of TMA 1970 and Instalment Payments Regulations
(1)
Section 59E of TMA 1970 (further provision as to when corporation tax is due and payable) has effect as if, in subsection (11) after paragraph (f) there were inserted—
“(g)
to any sum chargeable on a company under section 279 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 (electricity generator levy) as if it were an amount of corporation tax chargeable on the company.”
(2)
Section 59F of that Act (arrangements for paying corporation tax on behalf of group members) has effect as if, in subsection (6)—
(a)
the “and” at the end of paragraph (d) were omitted,
(b)
after paragraph (e) there were inserted “, and
(f)
to any sum chargeable on a company under section 279 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023 (electricity generator levy) as if it were an amount of corporation tax chargeable on the company.”
(3)
The Instalment Payment Regulations have effect as if—
(a)
in paragraph (2), after “company” there were inserted “, other than a company that is, or is a member of a group that is, a generating undertaking (within the meaning of Part 5 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023),”, and
(b)
after that paragraph there were inserted—
“(2ZA)
References in these Regulations to profits, in any accounting period, of a company that is, or is a member of a group that is, a generating undertaking (within the meaning of that Part), are to the greater of—
(a)
the company's augmented profits within the meaning given by—
(i)
in the case of an accounting period beginning before 1 April 2023, section 279G of CTA 2010, or
(ii)
in the case of an accounting period beginning on or after that date, sections 18L and 18M of that Act,
(b)
where the company is a generating undertaking, its exceptional generation receipts (within the meaning of that Part, and
(c)
where the company is a member of a group that is a generating undertaking, the exceptional generation receipts of the undertaking.”
(4)
If—
(a)
electricity generator levy is chargeable on company, and
(b)
under the Instalment Payment Regulations one or more instalment payments in respect of the total liability of the company for an accounting period beginning before the day on which this Act is passed are treated as becoming due and payable before the day on which this Act is passed 2023 (“pre-commencement instalments”),
any amount of electricity generator levy chargeable for that period is to be ignored for the purposes of determining the amount of any pre-commencement instalment.
(5)
The first instalment in respect of that liability which is treated as becoming due and payable on or after the day on which this Act is passed is to be increased by the following amount, namely the difference between—
(a)
the aggregate amount of the pre-commencement instalments determined in accordance with subsection (4), and
(b)
the aggregate amount of those instalments determined ignoring that subsection.
(6)
In the Instalment Payment Regulations—
(a)
in regulations 6(1)(a), 7(2), 8(1)(a) and (2)(a), 9(5), 10(1), 11(1) and 13, references to those Regulations are to be read as including a reference to subsections (4) and (5) (and in regulation 7(2) “the regulation in question”, and in regulation 8(2) “that regulation”, are to be read accordingly), and
(b)
in regulation 9(3), the reference to those Regulations is to be read as including a reference to those subsections.
(7)
In this section “the Instalment Payment Regulations” means the Corporation Tax (Instalment Payments) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/3175).307
Application of Part 5 of CTA 2010 for the purposes of determining interests
(1)
Chapter 6 of Part 5 of CTA 2010 (group relief: equity holders and profits or assets available for distribution) applies for the purposes of determining the interests of persons in companies under the following provisions (each a “relevant provision”)—
(a)
section 287(4);
(b)
section 290(5);
(c)
section 292(1)(b)(ii), (3)(b) and (4)(b);

section 293(7)(b);
(e)
section 294(5)(b);
(f)
section 296(7)(b).
(2)
For those purposes that Part has effect as if—
(a)
references to section 151(4)(a) and (b) of that Act were references to the relevant provision,
(b)
in section 158 of that Act after subsection (2) there were inserted—
“(2A)
But for those purposes a person carrying on a business of banking is not treated as a loan creditor of a company in respect of any loan capital or debt issued or incurred by the company for money lent by the person to the company in the ordinary course of that business.”,
(c)
sections 171(1)(b) and (3), 173, 174 and 176 to 178 of that Act were omitted, and
(d)
in its application for the purposes of paragraph (a) of section 290(5), any reference to company A were to the person referred to in that paragraph.
(3)
That Part is to be read, for the purposes mentioned in subsection (1), with all modifications necessary to ensure that—
(a)
it applies to a company which does not have share capital, and to holders of corresponding ordinary holdings in such a company, in a way which corresponds to the way it applies to companies with ordinary share capital and holders of ordinary shares in such companies,
(b)
it applies to a company which is an unincorporated association in a way which corresponds to the way it applies to companies which are bodies corporate,
(c)
it applies in relation to ownership through an entity (other than a company), or any trust or other arrangement, in a way which corresponds to the way it applies to ownership through a company, and
(d)
for the purposes of achieving paragraphs (a) to (c), profits or assets are attributed to holders of corresponding ordinary holdings in unincorporated associations, entities, trusts or other arrangements in a manner which corresponds to the way profits or assets are attributed to holders of ordinary shares in a company which is a body corporate.
(4)
In subsection (3) “corresponding ordinary holding” in an unincorporated association, entity, trust or other arrangement means a holding or interest which provides the holder with economic rights corresponding to those provided by a holding of ordinary shares in a body corporate.308
Anti-avoidance
(1)
This section applies to arrangements if the main purpose, or one of the main purposes of the arrangements, is to—
(a)
reduce or avoid a charge to the electricity generator levy, or
(b)
otherwise avoid the effect of any of the provisions of this Part.
(2)
Any such reduction or avoidance that would (in the absence of this section) arise from such arrangements is to be counteracted by the making of such adjustments as are just and reasonable.
(3)
Where the arrangements result in a change in the composition of a generating undertaking that is a group (including where such a group ceases to exist), those adjustments may include adjustments to secure that the same liability to electricity generator levy arises, and can be recovered from members of the group, as if the composition of the group had not changed.
(4)
Any adjustments required to be made under this section (whether or not by an officer of Revenue and Customs) may be made by way of—
(a)
an assessment,
(b)
the modification of an assessment,
(c)
amendment or disallowance of a claim,
or otherwise.
(5)
In this section “arrangements” include any agreement, understanding, scheme transaction or series of transactions (whether or not legally enforceable).309
Information sharing

(c)
any other enactment or rule of law.
(5)
Nothing in this section authorises the making of a disclosure which—
(a)
contravenes the data protection legislation (save that the power conferred by this section is to be taken into account in determining whether a disclosure contravenes that legislation), or
(b)
is prohibited by any of Parts 1 to 7 or Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (save that the power conferred by this section is to be taken into account when determining whether a disclosure is prohibited by those provisions).310
Interaction of electricity generator levy with corporation tax
(1)
In calculating profits or losses for the purposes of corporation tax—
(a)
no deduction is allowed in respect of the electricity generator levy, and
(b)
no account is to be taken of any amount which is paid by a person to another person for the purposes of meeting or reimbursing the cost of the electricity generator levy.

(a)
is not to be taken into account in determining the profits or losses of either company for corporation tax purposes, and
(b)
for corporation tax purposes is not to be regarded as a distribution.311

make provision having retrospective effect, provided any such provision does not have the effect of increasing the amount of the electricity generator levy any generating undertaking is liable to;
(b)
make different provision for different purposes;
(c)

“438A
Application of section 438: certain creditors treated as qualifying infrastructure companies
(1)
This section applies where—
(a)
a company (“C”), at a time in the period mentioned in subsection (1) of section 438—
(i)
is a member of the worldwide group of which the qualifying infrastructure company mentioned in that subsection is a member, but
(ii)
is not a UK group company; and
(b)
C is a creditor in relation to an amount which—
(i)
is a relevant loan relationship debit (as defined in section 383) for the debtor company, or
(ii)
would be a relevant loan relationship debit if the debtor company were UK resident.
(2)
For the purposes of section 438, C is treated in relation to the amount mentioned in subsection (1)(b) (the “relevant loan amount”) as a qualifying infrastructure company if—
(a)
throughout the period mentioned in section 438(1), C—
(i)
meets the public infrastructure income test for the accounting period (see subsections (2) to (4) of section 433) and subsection (3) of this section), and
(ii)
meets the public infrastructure assets test for the accounting period (see subsections (5) to (10) of that section and subsection (4) of this section),
(but does not satisfy the conditions in subsection (1)(c) and (d) of section 433);
(b)
the loan to which the relevant loan amount relates (the “relevant loan”) is fully funded by another loan (the “corresponding loan”) made to C for that purpose and on substantially the same terms as the relevant loan; and
(c)
amounts arising to C in respect of the corresponding loan would, if section 438(2) applied to C, qualify as “exempt amounts” within the meaning of that subsection.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2)(a)(i), C is also treated as meeting the public infrastructure income test for an accounting period if all, or all but an insignificant proportion, of its income for the period derives from—
(a)
anything listed in any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 433(2),
(b)
shares in, or debt issued by, a company that meets the test in section 433(2) for that period,
(c)
shares in or debt issued by a company that is treated as meeting the public infrastructure income test for that period by reason of this subsection.
(4)
For the purposes of subsection (2)(a)(ii), C is also treated as meeting the public infrastructure assets test for an accounting period if all, or all but an insignificant proportion, of the total value of the company's assets recognised in an appropriate balance sheet on each day in that period derives from—
(a)
anything listed in any of paragraphs (a) to (e) of section 433(5),
(b)
shares in, or debt issued by, a company that meets the test in section 433(5) for that period,
(c)
shares in or debt issued by a company that is treated as meeting the public infrastructure assets test for that period by reason of this subsection.
(5)
For the purposes of determining whether amounts arising to C would qualify as exempt amounts under section 438(2) (for the purposes of subsection (2)(c) of this section), the recourse of a creditor is treated as being limited to relevant infrastructure matters if, in the event that C fails to perform its obligations in question, the recourse of the creditor is limited to—
(a)
anything listed in paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 438(4),
(b)
shares in or debt issued by a company whose income and assets consist wholly of income and assets within those paragraphs,
(c)
shares in or debt issued by a company whose income and assets consist wholly of income and assets within paragraphs (a) or (b) of this subsection, or
(d)
shares in or debt issued by a company whose income and assets consists wholly of income and assets within paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection, and so on.
(6)
For the purposes of subsection (5), in determining whether a company’s income and assets consists wholly of income and assets of a particular description, any source of income or any asset is ignored if, having regard to all the circumstances, it is reasonable to regard as insignificant the amount of income arising from the source, or (as the case may be) the value of the asset recognised, in the accounting period.”Partnerships and other transparent entities

Partial gross payment of distributions to partnerships
(1)
This regulation applies to the payment of a relevant distribution by a company if—
(a)
the company reasonably believes that the recipient is a partnership whose partners include a person or body—
(i)
to which paragraph (2) or (3) of regulation 7 applies, or
(ii)
to which paragraph (4) of that regulation applies where the partner’s share of the partnership profits are to be applied for the purposes of the fund, scheme, account or plan in respect of which that partner has duties,
(b)
the company has a reasonable belief as to the share of partnership profits that each partner is entitled to,
(c)
the company reasonably believes that arrangements exist that will result in each partner’s share of the partnership profits reflecting whether or not tax was deducted in relation to that partner (as a result of regulation 3(2) and this regulation), and
(d)
the company elects to make the payment in accordance with paragraph (2) (by making it in accordance with that paragraph).
(2)
The relevant proportion of the relevant distribution is to be paid without deduction of income tax.
(3)
The relevant proportion is equal to the sum of the shares of the partnership profits (expressed as proportions) to which each partner who falls within paragraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) is entitled.
(4)
But—
(a)
paragraph (2) is subject to the qualification in paragraph (7) of regulation 7, and
(b)
if the company’s belief as to any of the matters referred to in paragraph (1) is incorrect, these Regulations apply to the payment as if it were never one to which this regulation applied.
(5)
Upon discovering that a payment that was made in accordance with paragraph (2) should not have been made in accordance with that paragraph (as a result of paragraph (4) or otherwise), the company who made it must deliver an amended return in accordance with regulation 11.
(6)
Where this paragraph applies to the payment of a relevant distribution, the company making it must (in addition to its duty under regulation 6(1)) furnish the partnership with a statement in writing in respect of each partner that is not a partner who falls within paragraph (1)(a)(i) or (ii) showing the amount of tax deducted in relation to each such partner.

(3)
But the amendment is not to have effect in relation to a QAHC that became a QAHC before that date if the effect of the amendment would, by itself, cause the QAHC to cease to meet the ownership condition on that date, ignoring—

An officer of Revenue and Customs may issue the filing member with a notice of de-registration in relation to the registration.
(3)
The effect of an officer issuing a notice of de-registration is that, beginning with the effective date, the registration to which the notice relates is not to be treated as a registration under paragraph 6.
(4)
“The effective date” is a date specified in or determined by reference to the notice as the date on which the notice takes effect.
(5)
But a notice of de-registration does not affect the validity of a registration for the purposes of any obligation arising before the effective date.
(6)
An officer or Revenue and Customs may issue a notice of de-registration only if—
(a)
the filing member has applied for such a notice, and
(b)
it appears to the officer that the group will not be a qualifying multinational group for any accounting period beginning with the period in which the effective date falls.
8
(1)
This paragraph applies where the filing member of a registered group changes.
(2)
The new filing member must notify HMRC of the change before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the day the change occurs.
(3)
But, if the change occurs before the end of the period referred to in paragraph 6(6), the new filing member may notify HMRC of the change at any time before the end of that period even if later than the end of the period in sub-paragraph (2).
(4)
The notification must be given in the way specified in a notice published by HMRC.
9
(1)
The filing member of a registered group must notify HMRC of any other change to the information provided under paragraph 6.
(2)
The notification must be given before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with the day on which the change occurs.
(3)
But, if the change occurs before the end of the period referred to in paragraph 6(6), the filing member may notify HMRC of the change at any time before the end of that period even if later than the end of the period in sub-paragraph (2).
(4)
The notification must be given in the way specified in a notice published by HMRC.
Part 4
Information returns
10
(1)
The filing member of a registered group must submit an information return to HMRC for each accounting period in which the group is a qualifying multinational group, unless sub-paragraph (4) applies.
(2)
An “information return” is a return containing the following information—
(a)
identification of the members of the group;
(b)
information on the overall corporate structure of the group;
(c)
information relevant to the determination of effective tax rates, top-up amounts or allocation of top-up amounts;
(d)
such other information specified in a notice published by HMRC as HMRC may consider relevant to the sharing of information between Pillar Two territories in connection with the Pillar Two rules.
(3)
HMRC may specify in a notice the particular items of information to be submitted as part of an information return.
(4)
This sub-paragraph applies if an information return has been submitted for that period to another qualifying authority.
(5)
A “qualifying authority” is an authority outside the United Kingdom with which HMRC has an agreement under which the authority will share the information contained in information returns submitted to that authority with HMRC.
(6)
If sub-paragraph (4) applies, the filing member must notify HMRC (an “overseas return notification”).
(7)
An information return or overseas return notification must be submitted in the way specified in a notice published by HMRC.
(8)
HMRC may specify in a notice that other information is to be provided together with an overseas return notification.
(9)
An information return or overseas return notification must be submitted by the end of the period of 15 months beginning with the day after the end of the accounting period in respect of which the return or notification is being submitted.
(10)
But the longer period in sub-paragraph (11) applies if the return or notification is being submitted in respect of the first accounting period in relation to which the group is a registered group.
(11)
Where this sub-paragraph applies, the information return or overseas return notification must be submitted by the end of the period of 18 months beginning with the day after the end of the accounting period.
11
(1)
The filing member may amend a return submitted under paragraph 10 by notice to HMRC.
(2)
The filing member may further amend a return previously amended by further notice to HMRC.
(3)
No amendment may be made after the end of the period of 12 months beginning with the day after the latest date by which the return or notification was required to be submitted under paragraph 10.
(4)
An amendment must be submitted in the way specified in a notice published by HMRC.
12
HMRC may take into account an information return in performing any of its functions.
Part 5
Self-assessment returns
13
(1)
The filing member of a registered group must submit a self-assessment return to HMRC for each accounting period, unless sub-paragraph (3) applies.
(2)
A “self-assessment return” is a return containing—
(a)
an assessment by the filing member as to—
(i)
which members of the group are chargeable to multinational top-up tax, and
(ii)
the amount of multinational top-up tax is chargeable to each such member, and
(b)
such other information as may be specified in a notice published by HMRC.
(3)
This sub-paragraph applies if—
(a)
the conditions in sub-paragraph (5) are met in relation to the group for the accounting period,
(b)
the filing member has submitted a below-threshold notification to HMRC, and
(c)
the filing member has not withdrawn the below-threshold notification.
(4)
A “below-threshold notification” is a notification that the filing member—
(a)
considers that the conditions in sub-paragraph (5) are met for an accounting period, and
(b)
does not expect that the conditions will cease to be met for that accounting period or any subsequent accounting period.
(5)
The conditions are that—
(a)
the group was not a qualifying multinational group in the accounting period, and
(b)
the group is unlikely to be a qualifying multinational group in the next two accounting periods.
(6)
A self-assessment return or below-threshold notification must be submitted in the way specified in a notice published by HMRC.
(7)
HMRC may specify in a notice that other information is to be provided together with a below-threshold notification.
(8)
A self-assessment return or below-threshold notification must be submitted by the end of the period of 15 months beginning with the day after the end of the accounting period in respect of which the return or notification is being submitted.
(9)
But the longer period in sub-paragraph (10) applies if a self-assessment return is being submitted in respect of the first accounting period in relation to which the group is a registered group.
(10)
Where this sub-paragraph applies, the self-assessment return must be submitted by the end of the period of 18 months beginning with the day after the end of the accounting period.
14
(1)
The filing member may amend a return submitted under paragraph 13 by notice to HMRC.
(2)
The filing member may further amend a return previously amended by further notice to HMRC.
(3)
No amendment may be made after the end of the period of 12 months beginning with the day after the latest date by which the return or notification was required to be submitted under paragraph 13.
(4)
An amendment must be submitted in the way specified in a notice published by HMRC.
Part 6
Enquiries into a self-assessment return
15
(1)
This Part of this Schedule applies if the filing member of a multinational group has submitted a self-assessment return under paragraph 13 for an accounting period.
(2)
In this Part “return” means a self-assessment return (including as amended under paragraph 14).
16
(1)
An officer of Revenue and Customs may enquire into the return if, within the time allowed, the officer gives notice to the filing member of the officer's intention to do so.
(2)
The time allowed is—
(a)
if the return was submitted on or before the submission date, up to the end of the period of 12 months after the submission date;
(b)
if the return was submitted after the submission date, up to and including the quarter day next following the first anniversary of the day on which the return was delivered;
(c)
if the return is amended under paragraph 14, up to and including the quarter day next following the first anniversary of the day on which the return was amended.
(3)
The submission date is the day ending the period for submission of the return referred to in paragraph 13(8) (or the longer period referred to in paragraph 13(10) where applicable).
(4)
The quarter days are 31 January, 30 April, 31 July and 31 October.
(5)
A notice under this paragraph is referred to in this Part of this Schedule as a “notice of enquiry”.
(6)
A return that has been the subject of one notice of enquiry may not be the subject of another, except one given in consequence of an amendment of the return.
17
(1)
An enquiry may extend to anything contained in the return, or required to be contained in the return, including anything that relates—
(a)
to the question of whether multinational top-up tax is chargeable in respect of the accounting period, or
(b)
to the amount of tax so chargeable.
(2)
But, where the notice of enquiry is given in consequence of an amendment of a return—
(a)
at a time when it is no longer possible to give a notice of enquiry under paragraph 16(2)(a) or (b),
(b)
after a partial closure notice (see paragraph 22(1)) has been issued in relation to the matters to which the amendment relates or which are affected by the amendment, or
(c)
after an enquiry into a return has been completed,
the enquiry into the return is limited to matters to which the amendment relates or that are affected by the amendment.
18
(1)
For the purposes of this Part an enquiry is in progress into a return for the whole of the period—
(a)
beginning with the day on which notice of enquiry is given in relation to that return, and
(b)
ending with the day on which the enquiry is completed.
(2)
The enquiry is completed on the day a final closure notice is given (see paragraph 22(2)).
19
(1)
If at a time when an enquiry is in progress into a return an officer of Revenue and Customs forms the opinion—
(a)
that an amount stated in the return as the amount of multinational top-up tax payable by a member of the group is insufficient, and
(b)
that unless the assessment in the return is immediately amended there is likely to be a loss of tax to the Crown,
the officer may by notice in writing to the filing member amend the assessment to make good the deficiency.
(2)
In the case of an enquiry that under paragraph 17(2) is limited to matters arising from an amendment of the return, sub-paragraph (1) applies only so far as the deficiency is attributable to the amendment.
(3)
In the case of an enquiry in relation to which one or more partial closure notices have been given, sub-paragraph (1) applies only so far as the deficiency is attributable to matters not addressed by those notices.
20
(1)
This paragraph applies if a return is amended at a time when an enquiry is in progress into the return.
(2)
The amendment does not restrict the scope of the enquiry but may be taken into account (together with any matters arising) in the enquiry (whether or not the amendment takes effect under sub-paragraph (4)).
(3)
Sub-paragraph (4) applies where the amendment is made otherwise than under paragraph 19.
(4)
So far as the amendment affects the amount stated in the return as the amount of tax payable, the amendment does not take effect, in relation to any matter to which it relates or which is affected by it, while the enquiry is in progress, except to the extent that—
(a)
a partial closure notice has been given in relation to a matter to which the amendment relates or which is affected by it, and
(b)
the notice states that the amendment is to take effect.
(5)
The final closure notice—
(a)
must state whether and to what extent an amendment whose effect is deferred under sub-paragraph (4) is to take effect;
(b)
may state that an amendment made under paragraph 19, and whose effect is not terminated or amended by a partial closure notice, is to cease to have effect or is to be amended as specified in the notice.
21
(1)
At any time when an enquiry is in progress into a return any question arising in connection with the subject-matter of the enquiry may be referred to the tribunal for determination.
(2)
Notice of the referral must be given to the tribunal jointly by the filing member and an officer of Revenue and Customs.
(3)
More than one notice of referral may be given in relation to an enquiry.
(4)
An officer of Revenue and Customs or the filing member may withdraw a notice of referral.
(5)
The effect of the notice being withdrawn is that the questions referred are not (unless they have already been finally determined) to be finally determined by the tribunal.
(6)
While proceedings on a referral are in progress in relation to an enquiry—
(a)
no closure notice may be given in relation to the enquiry, and
(b)
no application may be made for a direction to give such a notice.
(7)
Proceedings are in progress where—
(a)
notice of referral has been given,
(b)
the notice has not been withdrawn, and
(c)
the questions referred have not been finally determined.
(8)
In this paragraph, a question referred is finally determined when—
(a)
it has been determined by the tribunal, and
(b)
there is no further possibility of the determination being varied or set aside (disregarding any power to grant permission to appeal out of time).
(9)
The determination of a question referred to the tribunal is binding on the parties to the referral in the same way, and to the same extent, as a decision on a preliminary issue in an appeal under Part 12 of this Schedule.
(10)
The determination must be taken into account by an officer of Revenue and Customs—
(a)
in reaching the officer's conclusions on the enquiry, and
(b)
in formulating any amendments of the return required to give effect to those conclusions.
(11)
The question determined may not be reopened on an appeal under Part 12 of this Schedule, except to the extent that it could be reopened if it had been determined as a preliminary issue in that appeal.
22
(1)
Any matter to which an enquiry into a return relates is completed by an officer of Revenue and Customs giving the filing member a partial closure notice.
(2)
An enquiry into a return is completed by an officer of Revenue and Customs giving the filing member a final closure notice.
(3)
In this Part of this Schedule, “closure notice” means a partial closure notice or a final closure notice.
(4)
A closure notice is a notice stating—
(a)
that the enquiry, or the enquiry in so far as it relates to a particular matter, is complete;
(b)
the conclusion reached in the enquiry.
(5)
The conclusion must be one of the following—
(a)
that no amendment of the return is required, or
(b)
that the amendments of the return specified in the notice are to be made.
(6)
A closure notice takes effect when it is given to the filing member.
(7)
The officer—
(a)
must provide additional information together with the notice as to the basis for the conclusion;
(b)
may provide such other information as the officer thinks fit.
(8)
A final closure notice may not, in relation to a matter to which a partial closure notice relates, state a different conclusion in respect of that matter to that stated in the partial closure notice.
23
(1)
The filing member may apply to the tribunal for a direction that an officer of Revenue and Customs give a closure notice within a specified period.
(2)
The tribunal hearing the application must give a direction unless satisfied that HMRC has reasonable grounds for not giving a closure notice within a specified period.
(3)
An application under this paragraph is to be treated as an appeal under Part 12 of this Schedule.
Part 7
Determinations where self-assessment return not submitted
24
This Part of this Schedule applies if the filing member of a multinational group has not submitted a self-assessment return under paragraph 13 for an accounting period.
25
(1)
An officer of Revenue and Customs may make a determination if—
(a)
the group is not a registered group and the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the group should be, or
(b)
the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the filing member should have submitted a self-assessment return.
(2)
A “determination” is a determination by the officer to the best of the officer’s knowledge and belief as to the total amount of tax payable by a member of the group for the accounting period.
(3)
The officer must give notice of the determination to the filing member.
(4)
The notice must state the date on which it was issued.
(5)
No determination may be made—
(a)
on or before the last date on which the return was required to be submitted or would have been so required had the group been a registered group;
(b)
more than 3 years after that date.
26
(1)
If, after a determination has been made—
(a)
a self-assessment return is submitted for the accounting period, and
(b)
an information return or overseas return notification has been submitted for that period,
the assessment in the self-assessment return supersedes the assessment in the determination.
(2)
Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply to a self-assessment return delivered after the later of—
(a)
the day 3 years after the day on which the power to make the determination first became exercisable, and
(b)
the day 12 months after the date of the determination.
(3)
Where—
(a)
proceedings have begun for the recovery of any tax assessed in a determination, and
(b)
before the proceedings are concluded the determination is superseded under sub-paragraph (1),
the proceedings may be continued as if they were proceedings for the recovery of so much of the tax assessed in the self-assessment return as is due and payable and has not been paid.
(4)
Where—
(a)
action is being taken under Part 1 of Schedule 8 to the F(No.2)A 2015 (enforcement of deduction from accounts) for the recovery of an amount (“the original amount”) of tax assessed in a determination, and
(b)
before that action is concluded the determination is superseded under sub-paragraph (1),
that action may be continued as if it were an action for the recovery of so much of the tax assessed in the return as is due and payable, has not been paid and does not exceed the original amount.
Part 8
Discovery assessments
27
(1)
If, in respect of an accounting period, an officer of Revenue and Customs discovers that—
(a)
an amount of multinational top-up tax that ought to have been assessed in respect of a multinational group has not been assessed, or
(b)
an assessment to tax is or has become insufficient,
the officer may make an assessment (a “discovery assessment”) in the amount which ought in the officer's opinion to be charged in order to make good to the Crown the loss of tax.
(2)
This is subject to the restrictions in paragraph 28.
28
(1)
This paragraph applies where the filing member of the group has submitted a self-assessment return under paragraph 13 for the accounting period in respect of which the officer makes a discovery assessment.
(2)
Where this paragraph applies, the power to make a discovery assessment—
(a)
may only be made in the two cases specified in sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), and
(b)
may not be made in the circumstances specified in sub-paragraph (6).
(3)
The first case is where the situation mentioned in paragraph 27(1) was brought about carelessly or deliberately on the part of—
(a)
a member of the group of which the person forms part, or
(b)
a person acting on behalf of a member of the group.
(4)
The second case is where an officer of Revenue and Customs, at the time the officer—
(a)
ceased to be entitled to give a notice of enquiry into the return submitted in respect of the group for the accounting period, or
(b)
completed an enquiry into the return,
could not have been reasonably expected, on the basis of the information made available to the officer before that time, to be aware of the situation mentioned in paragraph 27(1).
(5)
For this purpose information is regarded as made available to the officer of Revenue and Customs if—
(a)
it is contained in a self-assessment return, an information return, an overseas return notification or a below-threshold notification for the accounting period in question or either of the two immediately preceding accounting periods,
(b)
it is contained in any documents produced or information provided by the filing member for the purposes of an enquiry into any such return or notification, or
(c)
it is information the existence of which, and the relevance of which as regards the situation mentioned in paragraph 27(1)—
(i)
could reasonably be expected to be inferred by the officer of Revenue and Customs from information falling within paragraph (a) or (b), or
(ii)
are notified in writing to an officer of Revenue and Customs by the filing member or another person acting on the filing member's behalf.
(6)
No discovery assessment may be made if—
(a)
the situation mentioned in paragraph 27(1) is attributable to a mistake in the return as to the basis on which the tax liability ought to have been calculated, and
(b)
the return was in fact made on the basis or in accordance with the practice generally prevailing at the time it was made.
29
(1)
The general rule is that no discovery assessment may be made more than 4 years after the end of the accounting period to which it relates.
(2)
A discovery assessment in a case involving a loss of tax brought about carelessly by a member of the group (or a person acting on their behalf) may be made at any time not more than 6 years after the end of the accounting period to which it relates.
(3)
A discovery assessment in a case involving a loss of tax brought about deliberately by a member of the group (or a person acting on their behalf) may be made at any time not more than 20 years after the end of the accounting period to which it relates.
(4)
A discovery assessment in a case involving a loss of tax brought about as a result of a failure of a filing member to register with HMRC under paragraph 6 may be made at any time not more than 20 years after the end of the accounting period to which it relates.
30
(1)
The officer of Revenue and Customs must give notice of a discovery assessment to the filing member.
(2)
The notice must state—
(a)
the tax due,
(b)
the date on which the notice is issued, and
(c)
the time within which any appeal against the assessment must be made.
(3)
After notice of the assessment has been served under this paragraph, the assessment may not be altered except as provided for by or under this Schedule.
(4)
Where an officer of Revenue and Customs has—
(a)
decided to make an assessment to tax, and
(b)
taken all other decisions needed for arriving at the amount of the assessment,
the officer may entrust to another officer of Revenue and Customs the responsibility for completing the assessing procedure, whether by means involving the use of a computer or otherwise, including responsibility for serving notice of the assessment.
Part 9
Record-keeping requirements
31
(1)
The filing member of the group must—
(a)
keep such records as may be needed to enable it to deliver correct and complete returns if required, and
(b)
preserve those records in accordance with this paragraph.
(2)
The records must be preserved until the end of the relevant day.
(3)
“The relevant day” means—
(a)
the later of—
(i)
the ninth anniversary of the last day of the accounting period to which the records relate, and
(ii)
if a self-assessment return relating to that accounting period is submitted and a notice of enquiry into that return has been given before the anniversary referred to in sub-paragraph (i), the day at the end of the period of six months beginning with the day the enquiry is completed;
(b)
such earlier day as may be specified in a notice published by HMRC (and different days may be specified for different cases).
(4)
The duty to preserve records may be satisfied—
(a)
by preserving them in any form and by any means, or
(b)
by preserving the information contained in them in any form and by any means,
subject to any conditions or exceptions specified in a notice published by HMRC.
Part 10
Payments of multinational top-up tax
Timing of payments
32
(1)
Multinational top-up tax due must be paid by the end of the period of 15 months beginning with the day after the end of the accounting period.
(2)
But the longer period in sub-paragraph (3) applies if the liability to pay tax arises in respect of the first accounting period in relation to which a group is a qualifying multinational group.
(3)
Where this sub-paragraph applies, multinational top-up tax due must be paid by the end of the period of 18 months beginning with the day after the end of the accounting period.
(4)
A person’s liability to pay multinational top-up tax may be discharged by another member of the multinational group to which the liability relates (but see paragraph 37).
33
(1)
Interest is to accrue on amounts payable under paragraph 32, but not paid, from the day after the latest date on which the amounts were required to be paid.
(2)
The rate of interest is to be as provided in regulations under section 178 of FA 1989.
[F533A
(1)
Where a person has paid an amount that has been paid by way of multinational top-up tax but the amount is not due, the amount incurs interest at the rate provided for in regulations made under section 178 of FA 1989 from the later of—
(a)
the day after the latest day (under paragraph 32) by which the amount paid would have been required to be paid as multinational top-up tax if it were due, and
(b)
the day on which the amount was paid.
(2)
See paragraph 51 for provision about making claims for the repayment of an amount that is not tax that was due (but see also paragraph 52 which, for example, prevents such a claim being made where an amendment to an assessment can be, or could have been, made).]

by any person in seeking to resolve disagreement about the matter.
(5)
The review must take account of any representations made by the appellant at a stage which gives HMRC a reasonable opportunity to consider them.
59
(1)
The review may conclude that HMRC's view of the matter (as notified to the appellant under paragraph 57(4) or 58(2)) is to be—
(a)
upheld,
(b)
varied, or
(c)
cancelled.
(2)
HMRC must notify the appellant of the conclusions of the review and the reasoning for those conclusions within—
(a)
the period of 45 days beginning with the relevant day, or
(b)
such other period as may be agreed.
(3)
In sub-paragraph (2) “relevant day” means—
(a)
in a case where the appellant required the review, the day when HMRC notified the appellant of HMRC's view of the matter;
(b)
in a case where HMRC offered the review, the day when HMRC received notification of the appellant's acceptance of the offer.
(4)
If HMRC do not give notice of the conclusions of the review within the period specified in sub-paragraph (3), the review is treated as having concluded that HMRC's view of the matter in question is upheld.
(5)
If sub-paragraph (4) applies, HMRC must notify the appellant of the conclusions which the review is treated as having reached.
(6)
The conclusions of a review are to be treated as if they were contained in a settlement agreement under paragraph 61, but the right to withdraw from such an agreement does not apply in relation to that notional agreement.
(7)
Sub-paragraph (6) does not apply to the matter if, or to the extent that, the appellant notifies the appeal to the tribunal.
(8)
The appellant may notify the appeal to the tribunal—
(a)
within the post-review period;
(b)
after the end of that period only if the tribunal gives permission.
(9)
The post-review period is—
(a)
if HMRC has notified the appellant of the conclusions of the review in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), the period of 30 days beginning with that notice;
(b)
if HMRC has not so notified the appellant, the period beginning with the day following the last day of the period specified in sub-paragraph (2) and ending 30 days after the date on which HMRC gives notice in accordance with sub-paragraph (5).
60
(1)
In paragraphs 57 to 59, a reference to the appellant includes a person acting on behalf of the appellant except in relation to—
(a)
notification by HMRC of an offer of review (and of their view of the matter) under paragraph 57;
(b)
notification of HMRC's view under paragraph 58(2)(a);
(c)
notification of the conclusions of a review under paragraph 59(2) or (5).
(2)
But if any such notification is given to the appellant, a copy of the notification may also be given to a person acting on behalf of the appellant.
(3)
A notification in connection with a review must be given in writing.
Settlement agreements
61
(1)
“Settlement agreement” means an agreement in writing between the appellant and an officer of Revenue and Customs that is—
(a)
entered into before the appeal is determined, and
(b)
to the effect that the decision appealed against should be upheld without variation, varied in a particular manner or discharged or cancelled.
(2)
Where a settlement agreement is entered into in relation to an appeal, the consequences are to be the same (for all purposes) as if, at the time the agreement was entered into, the tribunal had decided the appeal and had upheld the decision without variation, varied it in that manner or discharged or cancelled it, as the case may be.
(3)
Sub-paragraph (2) does not apply if, within 30 days beginning with the date on which the settlement agreement was entered into, the appellant gives notice in writing to HMRC that it wishes to withdraw from the agreement.
(4)
Sub-paragraph (5) applies where notice of an appeal has been given and—
(a)
the appellant notifies HMRC, orally or in writing, that the appellant does not wish to proceed with the appeal, and
(b)
HMRC does not, within 30 days after that notification, give the appellant notice in writing indicating that HMRC is unwilling that the appeal should be withdrawn.
(5)
Sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) have effect as if, at the date of the appellant's notification, the appellant and an officer of Revenue and Customs had agreed that the decision under appeal should be upheld without variation.
Determination by tribunal
62
(1)
The appellant may notify the appeal to the tribunal.
(2)
If the tribunal decides that a person is overcharged to multinational top-up tax, the assessment must be reduced accordingly.
(3)
If the tribunal decides that a person is undercharged to multinational top-up tax, the assessment must be increased accordingly.
(4)
In a case where neither sub-paragraph (2) or (3) apply, the assessment is to stand good.
(5)
On the determination of the appeal—
(a)
any tax overpaid must be repaid as if a claim had been made under paragraph 51 on the day notice of the appeal was given to HMRC;
(b)
any tax payable in accordance with the determination is payable in accordance with paragraph 32.
(6)
Interest is to be incurred on amounts payable in accordance with those paragraphs.
(7)
Where a party to an appeal to the tribunal makes a further appeal, tax is to be payable or repayable in accordance with the determination of the tribunal or court (as the case may be), even though the further appeal is pending.
(8)
But if the amount charged by the assessment is altered by the order or judgment of the Upper Tribunal or court, then—
(a)
if too much tax has been paid, the amount overpaid must be refunded, with any interest allowed by the order or judgment, and
(b)
if too little tax has been charged, the tax is payable in accordance with paragraph 32.
(9)
The determination of the tribunal is final and conclusive except as otherwise provided in sections 10 to 16 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.
Postponement of payment pending appeal
63
(1)
The general rule is that an appeal under this Part of this Schedule does not postpone any liability to pay multinational top-up tax.
(2)
Accordingly, the periods within which tax is payable under paragraph 32 continue to apply notwithstanding an appeal.
(3)
But a liability may be postponed if—
(a)
a determination is made by HMRC to that effect;
(b)
a direction is made by a tribunal to that effect;
(c)
HMRC and the appellant agree to a postponement.
(4)
The effect of a liability being postponed is that the period within which the tax is payable is extended by the period of the postponement.
(5)
The period of the postponement—
(a)
may not begin after the date the appeal is determined;
(b)
is to end on the date the appeal is determined.
64
(1)
The appellant may apply to HMRC for a determination if the appellant has grounds to believe that—
(a)
a person has been overcharged to multinational top-up tax;
(b)
an amount of tax postponed under a previous determination is excessive or insufficient.
(2)
An application must be made within 30 days after the specified date (see paragraph 55(4)), unless sub-paragraph (3) applies.
(3)
This sub-paragraph applies if—
(a)
there is a change in the circumstances of the case as a result of which the appellant has grounds to believe the matter in sub-paragraph (1), or
(b)
the application could, if it were a notice of appeal, be given at a later date under paragraph 55(6).
(4)
The application must state the amount believed to be overcharged and the grounds for that belief.
(5)
HMRC may determine—
(a)
whether any amount of tax is to be postponed, and
(b)
the amount of any tax postponed.
(6)
The amount of any tax postponed is to be determined as the amount (if any) by which it appears that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is overcharged.
65
(1)
The appellant may apply to the tribunal for a direction if—
(a)
the appellant has applied to HMRC for a determination,
(b)
HMRC has made a determination, and
(c)
the appellant does not agree with the determination.
(2)
The tribunal may direct whether the determination of HMRC was correct.
(3)
A decision of the tribunal under this paragraph is final and conclusive (despite the provisions of sections 12 and 15 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007).
66
(1)
HMRC and the appellant may agree that payment of an amount of tax should be postponed pending the determination of the appeal.
(2)
The agreement may modify a determination by HMRC under paragraph 64.
(3)
Where the agreement does so, it is to be treated in the same way as a settlement agreement under paragraph 61.
(4)
The consequences of an agreement are to be the same as if the tribunal had, at the time when the agreement was entered into, made a direction to the same effect as the agreement.
(5)
The existence of an agreement does not preclude a further determination by HMRC or direction by the tribunal modifying the agreement.
(6)
An agreement—
(a)
must be made in writing;
(b)
may be made with a person acting on behalf of the appellant in relation to the appeal.
Special provisions as to penalties
67
(1)
This paragraph applies to an appeal as to—
(a)
whether a penalty under paragraph 42, 43 or 46 is payable;
(b)
the amount of such a penalty.
(2)
Payment of the penalty is always postponed pending determination of the appeal.
(3)
Accordingly—
(a)
paragraphs 63(1) to (3) and 64 to 66 do not apply to such an appeal;
(b)
paragraphs 63(4) and (5) always apply to such an appeal.
(4)
If the appeal is notified to the tribunal, the tribunal may—
(a)
confirm a decision of HMRC;
(b)
substitute for the decision another decision that HMRC had power to make.
(5)
The tribunal may only make a decision that HMRC had power to make under paragraph 49 (reduction of penalties) if the tribunal considers HMRC’s decision to have been flawed when considered in light of the principles applicable in proceedings for judicial review.
(6)
On determination of the appeal, where a penalty is payable it is to be paid before the end of 30 days beginning with the day on which the determination was issued.

Intra-group transfers before entry into regime
2
(1)
Sub-paragraph (3) applies where—
(a)
assets are transferred from one member of a multinational group to another member of that group,
[F1(b)
the Pillar Two rules do not apply to the transferor for the accounting period in which the transfer takes place (but in determining this, section 255(4) has effect as if sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b) were omitted),
(ba)
a qualifying domestic top-up tax does not apply in relation to the transferor for that period, and]
(c)
the transfer took place on or after 1 December 2021.
(2)
But sub-paragraph (3) does not apply in relation to a transfer of assets manufactured, or of a class or description sold, in the course of carrying on a trade by the transferor or the transferee.
(3)
Where this sub-paragraph applies, for the purposes of Part 3 of this Act—
(a)
the value of the assets at the relevant time is the carrying value of the assets in the hands of the transferor immediately before the transfer, and
(b)
any deferred tax asset that would arise in relation to the assets in the underlying profits of the transferee is limited to [F2the lesser of the cap amount and the sum of—
(i)
the value of deferred tax assets that arose in relation to the assets before their transfer, and
(ii)]
the tax paid amount in relation to the transfer of assets.
[F3(3A)
For the purposes of determining the value of a deferred tax asset under sub-paragraph (3)(b)(i)—
(a)
if the rate of tax in relation to that asset is greater than 15%, the value is to be adjusted so that it reflects the value it would be if the rate had been 15%, and
(b)
exclude the impact of any valuation adjustments or accounting recognition adjustments.]
(4)
For the purposes of this paragraph “the relevant time” means the later of—
(a)
the date of the transfer, and

the commencement of the first accounting period in which [F4the Pillar Two rules apply to the transferee.]
F5(i)

(5)
Where the relevant time is after the date of the transfer—
(a)
the value of the assets at the relevant time is to be adjusted to reflect—
(i)
capitalised expenditure incurred in respect of the assets in the period between the date of the transfer and the relevant time, and
(ii)
amortisation and depreciation of the assets that, had the transfer not occurred, would have been recognised by the transferor if the transferor had continued to use the accounting policies and rates for amortisation and depreciation of the assets previously used, and
(b)
the tax paid amount in relation to the transfer of the assets [F6, and the value of deferred tax assets that arose in relation to the assets before their transfer, are] to be adjusted to reflect the matters referred to in paragraph (a)(i) and (ii).
(6)
To determine the “tax paid amount” in relation to a transfer of assets take the following steps—
Step 1
Determine the amount of the tax expense of the transferor in relation to the transfer of the assets that relates to covered taxes.
Step 2
Determine the amount, if any, of qualifying current tax expense relating to the transfer of the assets that would have been allocated to the transferor as a result of section 177 or 179 (permanent establishments and controlled foreign company regimes) if—
(a)
[F7the ultimate parent had been located in the United Kingdom and the accounting period commenced on or after 31 December 2023, and]
(b)
section 179(2) (restriction of allocation of mobile income) were ignored.
Step 3
Add together the amounts determined under Steps 1 and 2.
[F8(7)
In determining the tax expense of the transferor in relation to the transfer of the assets—
(a)
where any loss arising in the accounting period in which the transfer took place is offset against any taxable gain arising on the transfer, ignore that offsetting, and
(b)
exclude the impact of any valuation adjustments or accounting recognition adjustments.]
(8)
The “cap amount” in relation to a transfer of assets is the amount given by—
(a)
dividing—
(i)
the amount of tax expense determined under Step 1 in sub-paragraph (6), by
(ii)
the nominal rate of tax to which that expense relates, and
(b)
multiplying the result of paragraph (a) by 15%.
(9)
Where [F9the sum of] the tax paid amount [F10and the value of deferred tax assets that arose in relation to the assets before their transfer is greater than] the cap amount F11..., the filing member may elect that sub-paragraph (3) does not apply in relation to the transfer of assets.
(10)
Paragraph 2 of Schedule 15 (annual elections) applies to an election under sub-paragraph (9).
(11)
For the purposes of this paragraph,
[F12(a)]
“a transfer of assets” includes a transaction that relates to assets that does not result in a change in their ownership if the transaction has [F13a similar effect for accounting purposes to] a change in ownership of those assets;
[F14(b)
a qualifying domestic top-up tax is not to be taken as applying to a member of a multinational group if provision for a QDMTT Safe Harbour (within the meaning of the Pillar Two rules) applies to it.]
[F15(12)
Where assets are transferred from one member of a multinational group to another member of that group as a result of a series of transfers that—
(a)
fall within sub-paragraph (1), but
(b)
do not fall within sub-paragraph (2),
that series is to be treated as a single transfer of assets that falls within sub-paragraph (1).
(13)
This paragraph applies to that single transfer as if—
(a)
the reference to the transferor in sub-paragraph (3)(a) were to the transferor in relation to the first transfer in the series,
(b)
the references in sub-paragraph (3)(b) to the cap amount, the value of deferred tax assets that arose in relation to the assets before their transfer and the tax paid amount were to the aggregate of each such amount or value as determined for the purpose of each transfer that makes up the series,
(c)
the reference to the date of the transfer in sub-paragraph (4)(a) were to the date of the last transfer in the series, and
(d)
the references to the transferee in sub-paragraph (4)(b) were to the transferee in relation to the last transfer in the series.]

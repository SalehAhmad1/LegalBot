In the following provisions of this section, “relevant registration provision” means the provision under which P would be entitled to be registered as a British overseas territories citizen (as mentioned in subsection (1)(b)).
(3)
If the relevant registration provision is section 17(2), a person who is registered as a British overseas territories citizen under this section is a British overseas territories citizen by descent.
(4)

(a)
the consent of P’s natural father, and
(b)
the consent of P’s mother,
insofar as they would be required by section 17(5)(c) (as read with section 17(6)(b)), had P’s mother been married to P’s natural father at the time of P’s birth.

(3)
If P is under the age of 18, no application may be made unless the consent of P’s natural father and mother to the registration has been signified in the prescribed manner.
(4)
But if P’s natural father or mother has died on or before the date of the application, the reference in subsection (3) to P’s natural father and mother is to be read as a reference to either of them.
(5)
The Secretary of State may, in the special circumstances of a particular case, waive the need for any or all of the consents required by subsection (3) (as read with subsection (4)) to be given.

(4)
P is an “eligible non-British national” if—
(a)
P was never a British subject or citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies; and

(2)
Subject to subsection (7), an asylum claim declared inadmissible under subsection (1) cannot be considered under the immigration rules.
(3)

(a)
the claimant’s life and liberty are not threatened in that State by reason of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion,
(b)
the State is one from which a person will not be sent to another State—

(c)
a person may apply to be recognised as a refugee and (if so recognised) receive protection in accordance with the Refugee Convention, in that State.
(5)
For the purposes of this section, a claimant has “a connection” to a safe third State if they meet any of conditions 1 to 5 set out in section 80C in relation to the State.
(6)
The fact that an asylum claim has been declared inadmissible under subsection (1) by virtue of the claimant’s connection to a particular safe third State does not prevent the Secretary of State from removing the claimant to any other safe third State.
(7)
An asylum claim that has been declared inadmissible under subsection (1) may nevertheless be considered under the immigration rules—
(a)
if the Secretary of State determines that there are exceptional circumstances in the particular case that mean the claim should be considered, or
(b)
in such other cases as may be provided for in the immigration rules.
(8)
In this section and section 80C—
(a)
“asylum claim”, “Human Rights Convention”, “immigration rules” and “the Refugee Convention” have the same meanings as in section 80A;
(b)
a reference to anything being done in accordance with the Refugee Convention is a reference to the thing being done in accordance with the principles of the Convention, whether or not by a signatory to it.
80C
Meaning of “connection” to a safe third State
(1)
Condition 1 is that the claimant—
(a)
has been recognised as a refugee in the safe third State, and
(b)
remains able to access protection in accordance with the Refugee Convention in that State.

Condition 2 is that the claimant—
(a)
has otherwise been granted protection in a safe third State as a result of which the claimant would not be sent from the safe third State to another State—
(i)
otherwise than in accordance with the Refugee Convention, or
(ii)
in contravention of their rights under Article 3 of the Human Rights Convention, and
(b)
remains able to access that protection in that State.
(3)
Condition 3 is that the claimant has made a relevant claim to the safe third State and the claim—
(a)
has not yet been determined, or
(b)
has been refused.
(4)
Condition 4 is that—
(a)
the claimant was previously present in, and eligible to make a relevant claim to, the safe third State,
(b)
it would have been reasonable to expect them to make such a claim, and
(c)
they failed to do so.
(5)
Condition 5 is that, in the claimant’s particular circumstances, it would have been reasonable to expect them to have made a relevant claim to the safe third State (instead of making a claim in the United Kingdom).
(6)
For the purposes of this section, a “relevant claim” to a safe third State is a claim—
(a)
to be recognised as a refugee in the State for the purposes of the Refugee Convention, or
(b)
for protection in the State of the kind mentioned in subsection (2)(a).
(7)
For the purposes of this section “claimant” and “safe third State” have the same meanings as in section 80B; and see subsection (8) of that section.”

(a)
the State,
(b)
any party or organisation controlling the State or a substantial part of the territory of the State, or

any non-State actor, if it can be demonstrated that the actors mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b), including any international organisation, are unable or unwilling to provide reasonable protection against persecution.
(2)
For the purposes of that Article, the persecution must be—
(a)
sufficiently serious by its nature or repetition as to constitute a severe violation of a basic human right, in particular a right from which derogation cannot be made under Article 15 of the Human Rights Convention, or

an act of physical or mental violence, including an act of sexual violence;
(b)
a legal, administrative, police or judicial measure which in itself is discriminatory or which is implemented in a discriminatory manner;

Article 1(A)(2): well-founded fear
(1)
In deciding for the purposes of Article 1(A)(2) of the Refugee Convention whether an asylum seeker’s fear of persecution is well-founded, the following approach is to be taken.
(2)
The decision-maker must first determine, on the balance of probabilities—
(a)
whether the asylum seeker has a characteristic which could cause them to fear persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion (or has such a characteristic attributed to them by an actor of persecution), and
(b)
whether the asylum seeker does in fact fear such persecution in their country of nationality (or in a case where they do not have a nationality, the country of their former habitual residence) as a result of that characteristic.
(See also section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc) Act 2004 (asylum claims etc: behaviour damaging to claimant’s credibility).)
(3)
Subsection (4) applies if the decision-maker finds that—
(a)
the asylum seeker has a characteristic mentioned in subsection (2)(a) (or has such a characteristic attributed to them), and
(b)
the asylum seeker fears persecution as mentioned in subsection (2)(b).
(4)
The decision-maker must determine whether there is a reasonable likelihood that, if the asylum seeker were returned to their country of nationality (or in a case where they do not have a nationality, the country of their former habitual residence)—
(a)
they would be persecuted as a result of the characteristic mentioned in subsection (2)(a), and
(b)
they would not be protected as mentioned in section 34.
(5)
The determination under subsection (4) must also include a consideration of the matter mentioned in section 35 (internal relocation).

the concept of religion may include consideration of matters such as—
(i)
the holding of theistic, non-theistic or atheistic beliefs,

(iii)
other religious acts or expressions of view, or
(iv)
forms of personal or communal conduct based on or mandated by any religious belief;
(c)
the concept of nationality is not confined to citizenship (or lack of citizenship) but may include consideration of matters such as membership of a group determined by its cultural, ethnic or linguistic identity, common geographical or political origins or its relationship with the population of another State;
(d)
the concept of political opinion includes the holding of an opinion, thought or belief on a matter related to a potential actor of persecution and to its policies or methods, whether or not the person holding that opinion, thought or belief has acted upon it.
(2)
A group forms a particular social group for the purposes of Article 1(A)(2) of the Refugee Convention only if it meets both of the following conditions.
(3)
The first condition is that members of the group share—
(a)
an innate characteristic,
(b)
a common background that cannot be changed, or
(c)
a characteristic or belief that is so fundamental to identity or conscience that a person should not be forced to renounce it.
(4)

(5)
A particular social group may include a group based on a common characteristic of sexual orientation, but for these purposes sexual orientation does not include acts that are criminal in any part of the United Kingdom.

Section 40(5E)
“SCHEDULE 4A
Deprivation of Citizenship without notice: judicial oversight
Deprivation without notice: application to Special Immigration Appeals Commission
1
(1)
If the Secretary of State proposes to make a conducive grounds deprivation order without notice, the Secretary of State may apply to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission under this paragraph.
(2)
If the Secretary of State makes a conducive grounds deprivation order without notice, the Secretary of State must apply to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission under this paragraph within the period of seven days beginning with the day on which the order is made (unless an application has already been made under sub-paragraph (1)).
(3)
The function of the Commission on an application under this paragraph is to determine whether, in respect of each condition in section 40(5A) on which the Secretary of State relies, the Secretary of State’s view is obviously flawed.
(4)
In determining that question, the Commission must apply the principles that would be applicable on an application for judicial review.
(5)
If the Commission determines that the Secretary of State’s view is obviously flawed in respect of each condition in section 40(5A) on which the Secretary of State relies—
(a)
if the order in question has not been made, section 40(5) applies in relation to the order (notwithstanding section 40(5A));
(b)
if the order has been made, the Secretary of State must, within the period of 14 days beginning with the day on which the Commission made the determination—
(i)
give late notice in respect of the order,
(ii)
revoke the order, or
(iii)
make an application under sub-paragraph (6).
(6)
The Secretary of State may (at any time) make an application to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission for fresh consideration of a decision the Secretary of State has made under section 40(5A) where—
(a)
in the opinion of the Secretary of State, circumstances have changed materially since the determination mentioned in sub-paragraph (5), or
(b)
the Secretary of State wishes to provide further evidence to the Commission.
Sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) apply to an application under this sub-paragraph.
Deprivation of citizenship without notice: review
2
(1)
Sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) apply if—
(a)
the Secretary of State makes a conducive grounds deprivation order without notice, and
(b)
the Special Immigration Appeals Commission has not made the determination mentioned in paragraph 1(5) (Secretary of State’s decision obviously flawed).
(2)
The Secretary of State must, at least once in every review period, review the circumstances of the person in respect of whom the order was made (so far as known) and decide whether to give late notice in respect of the order.
(3)
On such a review, the Secretary of State must decide to give late notice to the person unless it appears to the Secretary of State that any of the conditions in section 40(5A) is met (reading any reference in those provisions to notice under section 40(5) as a reference to late notice).
(4)
If the Secretary of State decides at any point to give late notice in respect of the order—
(a)
the Secretary of State must give the notice as soon as reasonably practicable, and
(b)
once the notice is given, sub-paragraph (2) ceases to apply in relation to the person.
(5)
If on the expiry of the final review period the Secretary of State has not given, or has not decided to give, late notice in respect of the order, the Secretary of State must make an application to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission within the period of seven days beginning with the day after the final day of that review period.
(6)
Sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) of paragraph 1 (except sub-paragraph (5)(a)) apply for the purposes of an application under sub-paragraph (5) as they apply for the purposes of an application under that paragraph.
(7)
For the purposes of this paragraph, each of the following is a “review period”—
(a)
the period of four months beginning with the day after the day on which the Special Immigration Appeals Commission first determined an application in relation to the order under paragraph 1, and
(b)
each of the next five successive periods of four months.
Interpretation
3
(1)
In this Schedule, references to making a conducive grounds deprivation order without notice are to making an order under section 40(2) without giving notice under subsection (5) of that section (in reliance on subsection (5A) of that section).
(2)
In this Schedule, “late notice”, in respect of an order under section 40(5), means written notice to the person in respect of whom the order was made specifying—
(a)
that the Secretary of State has made the order,
(b)
the reasons for the order, and
(c)
the person’s right of appeal under section 40A(1) or under section 2B of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997.”Prospective

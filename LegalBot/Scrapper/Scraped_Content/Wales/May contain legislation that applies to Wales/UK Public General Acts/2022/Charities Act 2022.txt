Power to borrow from permanent endowment
(1)
The Charities Act 2011 is amended as follows.
(2)
After section 284 insert—
“Power to borrow from permanent endowment
284A
Power to borrow from permanent endowment: general
(1)
This section applies to any available endowment fund of a charity.
(2)
The charity trustees may resolve to borrow an amount, not exceeding the permitted amount, from the available endowment fund if they are satisfied—
(a)
that it is expedient for the amount to be borrowed, in the light of the purposes set out in the trusts to which the fund is subject and the purposes of the charity, and
(b)
that arrangements are in place for the amount to be repaid within 20 years of being borrowed.
(3)
Any amount borrowed in accordance with subsection (2) no longer forms part of the available endowment fund and, as a result, is freed from the restrictions with respect to the expenditure of capital that applied to it when it was comprised in that fund.
(4)
An amount borrowed in accordance with subsection (2) may not be used to repay (in whole or in part) any amount previously borrowed from permanent endowment (whether the previous borrowing was by virtue of this section or otherwise).
(5)
When repaying an amount borrowed (whether in whole or in part), the charity trustees may resolve to pay an additional amount not exceeding the maximum estimated capital appreciation.
(6)
Any—
(a)
repayment of an amount borrowed, and
(b)
payment of an additional amount by virtue of a resolution under subsection (5),
is to be added to the available endowment fund and is to be subject to the same restrictions as to expenditure as apply to the other capital in the fund.
(7)
The powers conferred by this section—
(a)
may be restricted or excluded by the trusts of the charity;
(b)
are (subject to paragraph (a)) in addition to any other power to borrow that the charity or charity trustees may have.
(8)
If, and in so far as, the power conferred by subsection (5) confers power to accumulate income, it is not subject to section 14(3) of the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 2009 (which provides for certain powers to accumulate income to cease after 21 years).
(9)
In this section “available endowment fund”, in relation to a charity, means—
(a)
the whole of the charity’s permanent endowment if it is all subject to the same trusts, or
(b)
any part of its permanent endowment which is subject to any particular trusts that are different from those to which any other part is subject.
(10)
If a resolution under section 104A(2) has effect in respect of an available endowment fund (or portion of such a fund), references in this section to an “available endowment fund” include that fund (or portion) but do not include any returns from the investment of the fund (or portion) which have not been accumulated.
(11)
For the meaning of “permitted amount” and “maximum estimated capital appreciation” see sections 284B and 284C respectively.
284B
Calculation of the “permitted amount”
(1)
The “permitted amount” for the purposes of section 284A(2) is given by the formula—
where—
V is the value of the available endowment fund on the relevant date (ignoring the value, if any, of the benefit of the debt owed by the charity trustees representing outstanding borrowing from the fund), and
B is the amount of the charity trustees’ outstanding borrowing from the available endowment fund on that date.
(2)
In subsection (1)—
“outstanding borrowing” means outstanding borrowing by virtue of section 284A or otherwise;
the “relevant date” is the date on which the trustees resolve to borrow from the available endowment fund (see section 284A(2)).
(3)
If a resolution under section 104A(2) has effect in respect of the available endowment fund (or any part of it), for the purposes of subsection (1) the value of the available endowment fund does not include any returns from the investment of the fund (or part) which have not been accumulated.
284C
Calculation of the “maximum estimated capital appreciation”
(1)
The “maximum estimated capital appreciation” for the purposes of section 284A(5) is given by the formula—
R × I
where—
R is the amount of borrowing being repaid, and
I is the percentage increase in the relevant index between the month in which the amount was borrowed and the month preceding the month in which the repayment is made (or if there is no increase is nil).
(2)
The “relevant index” is whichever of the following is selected by the charity trustees from time to time—
(a)
the retail prices index;
(b)
the consumer prices index;
(c)
any similar general index of prices published by the Statistics Board.
(3)
In this section—
“consumer prices index” means the general index for consumer prices published by the Statistics Board;
“retail prices index” means the general index of retail prices (for all items) published by the Statistics Board.
284D
Inability to repay
(1)
If (at any time) it appears to the charity trustees that—
(a)
they will not be able to fulfil the arrangements put in place to repay an amount borrowed under section 284A, or
(b)
those arrangements are not sufficient to ensure that the amount is repaid,
the trustees must apply to the Commission for an order under this section directing them how to proceed.
(2)
An order under this section may give such directions as the Commission thinks fit, including—
(a)
that the relevant amount may be repaid over a longer period,
(b)
that the charity trustees put in place arrangements specified in the order, or
(c)

The nominated undertaker may, for Phase 2a purposes—
(a)
form and lay out means of access, and
(b)
improve existing means of access,
at any place within the Act limits.
(2)
In the case of works at a place shown on the deposited plans which require the opening of an access on to, or the alteration of, a highway used by vehicular traffic, the power under sub-paragraph (1) is exercisable on giving at least 28 days' notice to the highway authority.
(3)
Works which are the subject of a notice under sub-paragraph (2) may not be carried out at the place shown on the deposited plans if, within 28 days of the giving of the notice, the highway authority objects to the works being carried out there by giving the nominated undertaker notice to that effect.
(4)
The only ground on which the highway authority may object under sub-paragraph (3) is that works under sub-paragraph (1) should be carried out instead at another place within the Act limits to prevent or reduce—
(a)
injury to local amenity, or
(b)
prejudicial effects on road safety or on the free flow of traffic in the local area,
and are reasonably capable of being carried out there.
(5)
If, in the case of works under sub-paragraph (1) at a place shown on the deposited plans, the works require the opening of an access on to, or the alteration of, a highway used by vehicular traffic, they must be carried out in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the highway authority at the request of the nominated undertaker.

injury to local amenity, or
(b)
prejudicial effects on road safety or on the free flow of traffic in the local area,
and are reasonably capable of being so modified.
(7)
Works under sub-paragraph (1) may only be carried out at a place not shown on the deposited plans if the highway authority consents to the siting of the works; and such consent is not to be unreasonably withheld.
(8)
Works under sub-paragraph (1) at a place not shown on the deposited plans must be carried out in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the highway authority at the request of the nominated undertaker; and such approval is not to be unreasonably withheld.
(9)
In considering whether to give consent for the purposes of sub-paragraph (7), or approval for the purposes of sub-paragraph (8), in a case where the works require the opening of an access on to, or the alteration of, a highway used by vehicular traffic, the highway authority must have regard in particular to effects on road safety and on the free flow of traffic in the local area.
(10)
If, on application by the nominated undertaker for the approval of plans or specifications under sub-paragraph (5) or (8), the highway authority fails to notify the nominated undertaker of its decision on the application before the end of 28 days beginning with the date on which the application was made, it is to be treated as having approved the plans or specifications as submitted.
(11)
If a highway authority which receives an application for consent under sub-paragraph (7) fails to notify the applicant of its decision on the application before the end of 28 days beginning with the date on which the application was made, it is to be treated as having granted it.
(12)
Where an objection under sub-paragraph (3) leads to the carrying out of works under sub-paragraph (1) at a place not shown on the deposited plans, sub-paragraphs (5), (7) and (8) have effect in relation to the works as if the place were shown on the deposited plans.
(13)
Any dispute with a highway authority under this paragraph must be referred to arbitration if the parties so agree, but must otherwise be determined by the Secretary of State.

In providing the path or way, the nominated undertaker may deviate laterally to any extent from the lines shown on the deposited plans, within the limits shown on those plans (and references in this Part of this Schedule to a highway specified in column (3) of table 2 or in table 3 in Schedule 5 are to be construed accordingly).
Permanent obstruction
7

The powers under section 2(1), (3) and (5) may be exercised in such a way as to obstruct the highway, but only with the consent of the highway authority, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
(2)
Any dispute with a highway authority under sub-paragraph (1) must be referred to arbitration if the parties so agree, but must otherwise be determined by the Secretary of State.
(3)
If a highway authority which receives an application for consent under sub-paragraph (1) fails to notify the applicant of its decision on the application before the end of 28 days beginning with the date on which the application was made, it is to be treated as having granted it.

(3)
Before exercising the powers under sub-paragraph (1) in relation to a highway, and to an extent, specified in table 4 in Schedule 5, the nominated undertaker must consult the relevant authority.
(4)
The purpose of consultation under sub-paragraph (3) is to ensure public safety and, so far as reasonably practicable, to reduce public inconvenience.

(6)
Consent under sub-paragraph (5) must not be unreasonably withheld, but may be given subject to such conditions as the relevant authority may reasonably require in the interest of public safety or convenience.
(7)
If a relevant authority which receives an application for consent under sub-paragraph (5) fails to notify the applicant of its decision on the application before the end of 28 days beginning with the date on which the application was made, it is to be treated as having granted the application.
(8)
Any dispute with a relevant authority about consent under sub-paragraph (5) must be referred to arbitration if the parties so agree, but must otherwise be determined by the Secretary of State.
(9)
There is no need to reinstate a highway or part of a highway in relation to which any of the powers under sub-paragraph (1)(a) to (c) has been exercised where the exercise of the power comes to an end on the exercise, in relation to the highway or part, of the power under paragraph 2(1) or 3(1).

(c)
execute any works required for, or incidental to, any works authorised by paragraph (a) or (b).

In this paragraph, “apparatus” has the same meaning as in Part 3 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.
10
(1)
Works executed under this Act in relation to a highway which consists of or includes a carriageway are to be treated for the purposes of Part 3 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 (street works) as major transport works if—
(a)
they are of a description mentioned in section 86(3)(a), (c) to (e), (g) or (h) of that Act (which defines what highway authority works are major highway works), or
(b)
they are works which, had they been executed under the powers of the highway authority, might have been carried out in exercise of the powers under section 64 (dual carriageways and roundabouts) or 184 (vehicle crossings over footways and verges) of the Highways Act 1980.
(2)
Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply to works executed under powers delegated to a highway authority by an agreement under paragraph 14(2) of this Schedule (construction delegation agreements).

(3)
Any dispute with a highway authority under sub-paragraph (2) must be referred to arbitration if the parties so agree, but must otherwise be determined by the Secretary of State.

If, on application by the nominated undertaker for the approval of plans, sections or specifications under sub-paragraph (2), the highway authority fails to notify the nominated undertaker of its decision on the application before the end of 28 days beginning with the date on which the application was made, it is to be treated as having approved the plans, sections or specifications as submitted.
14

any alteration of the existing highway,
including any bridge over any railway.
(3)
Works executed by the controllers of an existing highway under a delegation agreement under sub-paragraph (2) which could have been carried out by them under section 64 or 184 of the Highways Act 1980 are to be treated for the purposes of section 86(3) of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 as having been so carried out by them.
(4)
References in this paragraph to the controllers of a highway are to the persons having the charge, management or control of it.

the highway is to be regarded as so provided for the use of traffic of such classes referred to in Schedule 4 to that Act as may be provided for in the regulations (and the regulations may make different provision for different parts of the highway).
(4)
Provision under sub-paragraph (3)(c) may be expressed by reference to classes of traffic which are at any time authorised under a scheme under section 16 of the Highways Act 1980 in relation to the road of which the highway is a realignment or extension.

This paragraph applies where under this Act the nominated undertaker constructs a road as a highway.
(2)
The resulting highway is created on the date on which the road is first open for public use.

(4)
Where the resulting highway is a temporary highway, it ceases to be a highway on the day after the date on which the road is last open for public use.
(5)
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4), the date on which the road is last open for public use is to be taken to be the date notified by the nominated undertaker, in accordance with sub-paragraph (6), to the highway authority as being the date on which the road is to be last open for public use.
(6)
The notification must be given to the highway authority by the nominated undertaker at least 28 days before the date on which the road is to be last open for public use.

(a)
provides a new highway, or
(b)
alters a highway, otherwise than by carrying out street works within the meaning of Part 3 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.
(2)
The new or altered highway must be maintained by and at the expense of the nominated undertaker for a period of 12 months from—
(a)
the date of practical completion, or
(b)
if later, the date on which it is first open for public use;
and after the end of that period must be maintained by and at the expense of the highway authority.
(3)
Sub-paragraph (2) is subject to—
(a)
any agreement between the nominated undertaker and the highway authority as to alternative arrangements relating to the maintenance of the highway, and
(b)
sub-paragraph (4), in respect of a period for which the nominated undertaker is under a duty to maintain the highway.
(4)
Unless otherwise agreed between the highway authority and the nominated undertaker, the highway authority must ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that safe passage along the new or altered highway is not endangered by snow or ice.
(5)
Where the highway authority is satisfied that a highway mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) is practically complete or is open for public use, it must, at the request of the nominated undertaker, certify to it in writing the date of practical completion of the highway or, as the case may be, the date on which it was first open for public use.
(6)
If the highway authority refuses a request to issue a certificate under sub-paragraph (5), or if the nominated undertaker disputes the date given in a certificate under that sub-paragraph, the matter must be referred to arbitration if the parties so agree, but must otherwise be determined by the Secretary of State.
(7)
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2), the date of practical completion of a highway, or the date on which it is first open for public use, is to be taken to be—

(b)
a highway altered under this Act,
the nominated undertaker may, by agreement with the persons having the charge, management or control of the highway, delegate to them the function of maintaining the bridge.
19
Section 58(1) and (2) of the Highways Act 1980 (special defence in action against highway authority for damages for non-repair of highway) applies to an action against the nominated undertaker in respect of damage resulting from its failure to maintain a highway under paragraph 17(2) or (3)(a) as it applies to an action against a highway authority as mentioned in section 58(1) of that Act (and references in section 58(1) and (2) to the highway authority are to be read accordingly).
20
Notwithstanding anything in section 46 of the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act 1845, as incorporated with this Act (see paragraph 4 of Schedule 28 to this Act), the nominated undertaker is not liable to maintain the surface of any highway under or over which the scheduled works are constructed, or the immediate approaches to any such highway.

SCHEDULE 9
Acquisition of rights in land etc: application of compulsory purchase legislation
Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 and compensation enactments
1
Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (referred to in this Schedule as “CPA 1965”), as applied by section 4(3) to the acquisition of land under section 4(1), and the enactments relating to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land, apply to a compulsory acquisition under section 4(1) by virtue of section 5—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 2, and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
2
(1)
The modifications referred to in paragraph 1(a) are as follows.
(2)
References in CPA 1965 to land are, in appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired or (as the case may be) the restrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed, or
(b)
the land over which the right is, or is to be, exercisable or (as the case may be) the land over which the restrictive covenant is, or is to be, enforceable.
(3)
For section 7 of CPA 1965 substitute—
“7
Measure of compensation in case of purchase of new right or imposition of new restrictive covenant
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard shall be had, not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is acquired or the restrictive covenant is imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”
(4)
The following provisions of CPA 1965 (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land)—
section 9(4) (failure of owners to convey),
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity),
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners), and
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are so modified as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be acquired compulsorily or the benefit of the covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5)
Section 11 of CPA 1965 (powers of entry) is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority have served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant as well as the notice required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under section 4(1)), they have power, exercisable in the same circumstances and subject to the same conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that covenant; and sections 12 (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13 (entry on enforcement officer's or sheriff's warrant in the event of obstruction) of that Act are modified accordingly.
(6)
Section 20 of CPA 1965 (compensation for short-term tenants) applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition of the land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such interests as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7)
Section 22 of CPA 1965 (protection of acquiring authority's possession of land where interest accidentally omitted from purchase) is so modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8)
For Schedule 2A to CPA 1965 substitute the version of that Schedule set out in Schedule 10 to this Act.
(9)
In section 5A of the Land Compensation Act 1961 (relevant valuation date)—
(a)
for subsection (5A) substitute—
“(5A)
If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right or enforcing a restrictive covenant in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965,
(b)
the authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 13 of Schedule 2A to that Act (as substituted by paragraph 2(8) of Schedule 9 to the High Speed Rail (West Midlands - Crewe) Act 2021) to acquire an interest in the land, and
(c)
the authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on and taken possession of that land when it entered on it for the purpose of exercising the right or enforcing the covenant.”, and
(b)
in subsection (5B), for paragraphs (a) and (b) substitute—
“(a)
a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, land is the subject of a general vesting declaration,
(b)
by virtue of paragraph 11(2) or 16(2) of Schedule A1 to the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981, the declaration has effect as if it included an interest in the land, and
(c)
the vesting date for the right or covenant is different from the vesting date for the interest in the land,”.
(10)
In the Land Compensation Act 1973, for section 44 substitute—
“44
Compensation for injurious affection
(1)
Where—
(a)
a right over land is acquired from any person for the purpose of works which are to be situated partly on that land and partly elsewhere, or
(b)
a restrictive covenant over land is imposed on any person for the purpose of such works,
compensation for injurious affection of land retained by that person shall be assessed by reference to the whole of the works and not only the part situated on the land over which the right is exercisable or the covenant is enforceable.
(2)
In this section, “compensation for injurious affection” means compensation for injurious affection under section 7 or 20 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 as applied by paragraph 1 of Schedule 9 to the High Speed Rail (West Midlands - Crewe) Act 2021.”
Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 and compensation enactments
3
(1)
The Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 (“the 1981 Act”), as applied by section 4(4) to the acquisition of land under section 4(1), applies to a compulsory acquisition under section 4(1) by virtue of section 5—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 4, and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
(2)
The enactments relating to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land also apply to a compulsory acquisition under section 4(1) by virtue of section 5.
4
(1)
The modifications referred to in paragraph 3(1)(a) are as follows.
(2)
References in the 1981 Act to land are, in appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired or (as the case may be) the restrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed, or
(b)
the land over which the right is, or is to be, exercisable or (as the case may be) the restrictive covenant is, or is to be, enforceable.
(3)
References in the 1981 Act to the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 are to be read as references to that Act as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under section 4(1) by virtue of section 5.
(4)
Section 8(1) of the 1981 Act (vesting, and right to enter and take possession) is modified so as to secure—
(a)
that a general vesting declaration in respect of any right or restrictive covenant vests the right or the benefit of the covenant in the acquiring authority on the vesting date, and
(b)
that, as from the vesting date, the acquiring authority have power, exercisable in the same circumstances and subject to the same conditions, to enter land for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that covenant as if the circumstances mentioned in section 8(1)(a) and (b) of the 1981 Act had arisen.
(5)
Section 9(2) of the 1981 Act (right of entry under section 8(1) not exercisable in respect of land subject to certain tenancies, unless notice has been served on occupiers of the land) is modified so as to require a notice served by the appropriate authority under that provision to refer to the authority's intention to enter land specified in the notice in order to exercise the right or enforce the restrictive covenant.
(6)
In section 10(1) of the 1981 Act (acquiring authority's liability on vesting of land), the reference to the acquiring authority's taking possession of the land under section 11(1) of CPA 1965 is to be read instead as a reference to the authority's exercising the power to enter the land under that provision as modified by paragraph 2(5) of this Schedule.
(7)

2
In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.

withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)

7
If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8
If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9
If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10

(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)

(c)

12
If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13
If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.
14
(1)
If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2)
If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3)

of its decision on the request, or

(5)
Where the function of determining an appeal under paragraph 23 is transferred from one person to another, the person to whom the function is transferred must consider the matter afresh, but the fact that the function is transferred does not entitle any person to make fresh representations or to modify or withdraw any representations already made.

(a)
in the signposting of traffic diversions,
(b)
in the taking of other measures in relation to those diversions, or
(c)
in the repair of any highway by reason of the diversion of traffic from a road of a higher standard,

25
(1)
Not less than 28 days before commencing to construct any work authorised by this Act which is near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the nominated undertaker under paragraph 20, the nominated undertaker must submit to the undertakers a plan and description of the work and of any protective measures which the nominated undertaker proposes to take in respect of that apparatus, together with a specification of such measures where appropriate.
(2)
The work must be constructed only in accordance with the plan and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made by the undertakers for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus or for securing access to the apparatus, and the undertakers are to be entitled by their officer to watch and inspect the construction of the work.
(3)
If the undertakers within 14 days after the submission to them of any such plan and description, in consequence of the works proposed by the nominated undertaker, reasonably require the removal of any apparatus and give written notice to the nominated undertaker of that requirement, this Part has effect as if the removal of such apparatus had been required by the nominated undertaker under paragraph 20.
(4)
Nothing in sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) precludes the nominated undertaker from submitting at any time, or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the construction of the work, a new plan and description of it in lieu of the plan and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of those sub-paragraphs apply to and in respect of the new plan and description.
(5)
The nominated undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) in a case of emergency but in such a case it must give notice to the undertakers as soon as reasonably practicable and a plan and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently, and must comply with those sub-paragraphs so far as reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
26
(1)
If in consequence of the exercise of the powers of this Act the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed the nominated undertaker must, so far as reasonably practicable, provide alternative means of access to such apparatus which is no less convenient than the access enjoyed by the undertakers prior to the obstruction.
(2)
The nominated undertaker must, so far as is reasonably practicable, so exercise its powers under paragraphs 2 to 6 of Schedule 2 as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
(3)
Notwithstanding the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under paragraph 8 of Schedule 4, the undertakers may do all such works and things in any such highway as may be reasonably necessary to enable them to inspect, repair, maintain, renew, remove or use any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that highway.
27
Where, in consequence of this Act, any part of any highway in which any apparatus is situate ceases to be part of a highway, the undertakers may exercise the same rights of access to such apparatus as they enjoyed immediately before the passing of this Act, but nothing in this paragraph is to affect any right of the nominated undertaker or of the undertakers to require removal of that apparatus under this Part or the power of the nominated undertaker to construct works in accordance with paragraph 25.
28
(1)
Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the nominated undertaker must repay to the undertakers the reasonable expenses incurred by the undertakers in, or in connection with—

alternative apparatus of better type, or greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions, except where this has been solely due to using the nearest currently available type, or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or alternative apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated.
(4)
If the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions, or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the nominated undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined to be necessary in accordance with paragraph 31, then, if it involves cost in the construction of works under paragraph 23 exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertakers by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess
(5)
For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (3) and (4)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus except in a case where the apparatus as so extended serves a purpose (either additional to or instead of that served by the existing apparatus) which was not served by the existing apparatus, and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(6)
An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertakers in respect of works by virtue of this paragraph must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven and a half years earlier so as to confer on the undertakers any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus or of the system of which it forms part in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(7)
In any case where work is carried out by the nominated undertaker pursuant to paragraph 23 and, if such work had been carried out by the undertakers, the repayment made to the undertakers under this paragraph would fall to be reduced pursuant to sub-paragraphs (3) to (6), the undertakers must pay to the nominated undertaker such sum as represents the amount of that reduction.
29
(1)
This paragraph applies where, by reason of the construction of any of the works authorised by this Act, or any subsidence resulting from any of those works, any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of the undertakers, or there is any interruption in any service provided by any of the undertakers.
(2)
Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), the nominated undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by the undertakers in making good such damage or restoring the supply,
(b)
make reasonable compensation to the undertakers for loss sustained by them by reason of any such damage or interruption, and
(c)
indemnify the undertakers against claims, demands, proceedings, and damages which may be made or taken against, or recovered from the undertakers by reason of any such damage or interruption.
(3)
Nothing in sub-paragraph (2) is to impose any liability on the nominated undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of the undertakers, their officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4)
The undertakers must give the nominated undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of any such claim or demand must be made without the consent of the nominated undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, must have the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

(1)
Any dispute arising between the nominated undertaker and the undertakers under this Part is to be determined by arbitration if—
(a)
the parties agree, or

33
(1)
Subject to sub-paragraph (2), Part 10 of the electronic communications code applies for the purposes of the authorised works.
(2)
Parts 6 and 10 of the electronic communications code do not apply for the purposes of the authorised works—
(a)
insofar as such works are regulated by the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 or any regulation made under that Act,
(b)
where the nominated undertaker exercises a right under subsection (4)(b) of section 272 of TCPA 1990 or under an order made under that section to remove electronic communications apparatus, or
(c)
in respect of any matter regulated by sub-paragraphs (3) to (8) of paragraph 35.
34
The temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 does not affect any right of an operator under Part 8 of the electronic communications code in respect of any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion is in the highway.
35
(1)
Where a highway is stopped up under paragraph 2 or 3 of Schedule 4, any operator of an electronic communications code network whose electronic communications apparatus is under, over, in, on, along or across that highway may exercise the same rights of access in order to inspect, maintain, adjust, repair or alter that apparatus as if this Act had not been passed, but this is subject to sub-paragraph (2).
(2)
Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) affects any right of the nominated undertaker or the operator to require removal of that apparatus under this Part or the power of the nominated undertaker to alter or remove apparatus in accordance with Part 10 of the electronic communications code.
(3)
The nominated undertaker must give not less than 28 days' notice of its intention to stop up any highway under paragraph 2 or 3 of Schedule 4 to any operator of an electronic communications code network whose apparatus is under, over, in, on, along or across the highway.
(4)
Where a notice under sub-paragraph (3) has been given, the operator, if it reasonably considers that it is necessary for the safe and efficient operation and maintenance of the apparatus, may, and if reasonably requested so to do by the nominated undertaker in the notice, must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the service of the notice—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the operator may reasonably determine and have power to place it, or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in such other position as described in paragraph (a).
(5)
Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph the nominated undertaker must pay to any operator of an electronic communications code network an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the operator in or in connection with—
(a)
the execution of relocation works required in consequence of the stopping up of the highway, and
(b)
the doing of any other work or thing rendered necessary by the execution of relocation works.
(6)
Sub-paragraph (7) applies where—
(a)
in the course of the execution of relocation works under sub-paragraph (4)—
(i)
apparatus of better type, greater capacity or greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, smaller capacity or smaller dimensions, except where this has been solely due to using the nearest currently available type, capacity or dimension, or
(ii)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which existing apparatus was, and
(b)
the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the nominated undertaker, or, in default of agreement, is not determined to be necessary in consequence of the construction of the authorised works in order to ensure the continued efficient operation of the electronic communications code network of the operator.
(7)
If the execution of the relocation works involves cost exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the operator by virtue of sub-paragraph (5) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(8)
For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (6) and (7)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus except in a case where the apparatus as so extended provides more than an equivalent service, and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole (in either case of such type, capacity and dimensions as is reasonably appropriate) is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(9)
The amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an operator in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (5) (and having regard, where it applies, to sub-paragraph (7)) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than seven and a half years earlier so as to confer on the operator any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(10)
Sub-paragraphs (5) to (9) do not apply where the authorised works constitute major transport works or major highway works for the purpose of Part 3 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 (including that provision as applied by paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 to this Act), but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of any relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 of that Act (sharing of costs of necessary measures) and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section, and
(b)
the allowable costs are to be borne by the nominated undertaker and the operator in such proportions as may be prescribed by any such regulations.
36
(1)
Where the nominated undertaker or the Secretary of State affords to an operator facilities and rights for the construction, maintenance, repair, renewal and inspection of alternative apparatus on land held or used, or intended for use, by the nominated undertaker for the purposes of its undertaking under this Act or held by the Secretary of State, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the nominated undertaker or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State, and the operator or, in default of agreement, determined in accordance with paragraph 39.
(2)
In determining such terms and conditions, a person making a determination under paragraph 39 must have regard to any template provisions issued by the appropriate Ministers and determined in accordance with sub-paragraph (3); and must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the nominated undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised works and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the nominated undertaker or the use of the same; and
(b)
have regard to the operator's ability to fulfil its service obligations.
(3)
For the purposes of determining the matters under sub-paragraph (2) the appropriate Ministers must consult the operators to which paragraph 36 may apply on the form of the proposed template provisions, and any objections to the form of those provisions which have not been resolved within six months after this Act comes into force must be referred to an independent person acting as an expert appointed to make a final determination as to the form of the template provisions.
(4)
The independent person making a determination under sub-paragraph (3) is to be appointed by the President of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and in making that determination that person must have regard to the matters specified in sub-paragraph (2)(a) and (b).
(5)
If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the nominated undertaker or the Secretary of State in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted are more or less favourable on the whole to the operator than the facilities, rights, terms and conditions applying to the apparatus to be removed, compensation must be paid to or by the nominated undertaker or the Secretary of State to or by the operator in respect of the difference as is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case.
37
(1)
Sub-paragraph (2) applies where, by reason of the construction of the authorised works or any subsidence resulting from any of those works—
(a)
damage is caused to any electronic communications apparatus, other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works,
(b)
damage is caused to property of the operator of an electronic communications code network, or
(c)
there is any interruption in the supply of the service provided by the operator.
(2)
The nominated undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by the operator in making good such damage or restoring the supply,
(b)
make reasonable compensation to the operator for loss sustained by it, and
(c)
indemnify the operator against all claims, demands, proceedings, or damages which may be made or taken against, or recovered from, the operator, by reason of any such damage or interruption.
But this is subject to sub-paragraphs (3) to (5).
(3)
Sub-paragraph (2) does not apply in connection with any apparatus in respect of which the relations between the nominated undertaker and the operator are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991.
(4)
Nothing in sub-paragraph (2) is to impose any liability on the nominated undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of the operator, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(5)
The operator must give the nominated undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of any such claim or demand is to be made without the consent of the nominated undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, is to have the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(6)
This paragraph applies instead of section 176 (right to compensation) of the Housing and Planning Act 2016, as applied by paragraph 8(2) of Schedule 2 in relation to the exercise of the powers of paragraphs 2 to 6 of that Schedule.
38
In any case where Network Rail Infrastructure Limited (“Network Rail”) is the nominated undertaker the provisions of this Part have effect subject to any existing agreement between Network Rail and an operator relating to apparatus laid or erected on land belonging to Network Rail.
39
(1)
Any dispute arising between the nominated undertaker and an operator under this Part is to be determined by arbitration if—
(a)
the parties agree, or
(b)
the dispute relates to the amount of any sum payable under this Part,
but is otherwise to be determined by a person appointed by the appropriate Ministers.
(2)
Any person appointed by the appropriate Ministers under sub-paragraph (1) must, in determining any dispute arising under this Part, have regard to such matters as may be specified by the appropriate Ministers on making the appointment.
(3)
The costs and fees of the person determining the dispute and the costs of the parties to the dispute are to be allocated between the parties as that person may direct.

This paragraph applies to any request for approval of plans under paragraph 41 to the extent that the plans relate to a groundwater activity within the meaning of paragraph 3 of Schedule 22 to the Environmental Permitting Regulations, except where the circumstances described in paragraph 3(3) of that Schedule apply.
(2)
In exercising its functions in relation to that request the drainage authority must comply with the requirements of paragraph 7(2) to (5) of Schedule 22 to the Environmental Permitting Regulations, subject to paragraph 8 of that Schedule, as if the request for approval were as an application for a permit under those regulations.
43
The requirements which the drainage authority may make under paragraph 41 include conditions requiring the nominated undertaker at its own expense to construct such protective works (including any new works as well as alterations to existing works) as are reasonably necessary—
(a)
to safeguard any drainage work against damage, or
(b)

(4)
Subject to sub-paragraph (5), if within a reasonable period, being not less than 28 days from the date when a notice under sub-paragraph (3) is served upon the nominated undertaker, it has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the requirements of the notice and subsequently to make reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the drainage authority may execute the works specified in the notice and any expenditure reasonably incurred by it in so doing is to be recoverable from the nominated undertaker.
(5)
In the event of any dispute as to whether sub-paragraph (3) is properly applicable to any work in respect of which notice has been served under that sub-paragraph, or as to the reasonableness of any requirement of such a notice, the drainage authority must not, except in an emergency, exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (4) until the dispute has been finally determined.
45
(1)
Subject to sub-paragraph (5) the nominated undertaker must from the commencement of the construction of the specified works maintain in good repair and condition and free from obstruction any drainage work which is situated within the limits of deviation and on land held by the nominated undertaker for the purposes or in connection with the specified works, whether the drainage work is constructed under this Act or is already in existence.
(2)
If any such drainage work is not maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the drainage authority, the drainage authority may by notice require the nominated undertaker to repair and restore the work, or any part of it, or (if the nominated undertaker so elects and the drainage authority in writing consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to remove the drainage work and restore the site to its former condition, to such extent and within such limits as the drainage authority reasonably requires.
(3)
If, within a reasonable period being not less than 28 days beginning with the date on which a notice in respect of any drainage work is served under sub-paragraph (2) on the nominated undertaker, the nominated undertaker has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the reasonable requirements of the notice and has not subsequently made reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the drainage authority may do what is necessary for such compliance and may recover any expenditure reasonably incurred by it in so doing from the nominated undertaker.
(4)
In the event of any dispute as to the reasonableness of any requirement of a notice served under sub-paragraph (2), the drainage authority must not except in a case of emergency exercise the powers of sub-paragraph (3) until the dispute has been finally determined.

drainage works which are vested in the drainage authority, or which the drainage authority or another person is under an obligation to maintain and is not proscribed by the powers of the Act from doing so;
(b)
any obstruction of a drainage work for the purpose of a work or operation authorised by the Act and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Part.
46
(1)
If by reason of the construction of any specified work or of the failure of any such work the efficiency of any drainage work for flood defence purposes is impaired, or that work is otherwise damaged, so as to require remedial action, such impairment or damage must be made good by the nominated undertaker to the reasonable satisfaction of the drainage authority and if the nominated undertaker fails to do so, the drainage authority may make good the same and recover from the nominated undertaker the expense reasonably incurred by it in doing so.
(2)
In any case where immediate action by the drainage authority is reasonably required in order to secure that the imminent flood risk is avoided or reduced, the drainage authority may take such steps as are reasonable for the purpose, and may recover from the nominated undertaker the reasonable cost of so doing provided that notice specifying those steps is served on the nominated undertaker as soon as reasonably practicable after the drainage authority has taken, or commenced to take, the steps specified in the notice.
(3)
Nothing in paragraph 44, 45 or 46 authorises the drainage authority to execute works on or affecting an operational railway without the prior consent in writing of the nominated undertaker, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
47
(1)
The nominated undertaker must take all such measures as may be reasonably practicable to prevent any interruption of the free passage of fish in any fishery during the construction of any specified work.
(2)
If by reason of—
(a)
the construction of any specified work, or
(b)
the failure of any such work,
damage to a fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the Agency may serve notice on the nominated undertaker requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.
(3)
If, within such time as may be reasonably practicable for that purpose after the receipt of written notice from the Agency of any damage or expected damage to a fishery, the nominated undertaker fails to take such steps as are described in sub-paragraph (2), the Agency may take those steps and may recover from the nominated undertaker the expense reasonably incurred by it in doing so.
(4)
In any case where immediate action by the Agency is reasonably required in order to secure that the risk of damage to a fishery is avoided or reduced, the Agency may take such steps as are reasonable for the purpose, and may recover from the nominated undertaker the reasonable cost of so doing provided that notice specifying those steps is served on the nominated undertaker as soon as reasonably practicable after the Agency has taken, or commenced to take, the steps specified in the notice.
48
(1)
The nominated undertaker must indemnify the drainage authority from all claims, demands, proceedings or damages, which may be made or taken against, or recovered from the drainage authority by reason of—
(a)
any damage to any drainage work so as to impair its efficiency for flood defence purposes,
(b)
any damage to a fishery,
(c)
any raising or lowering of the water table in land adjoining the works authorised by this Act or adjoining any sewers, drains and watercourses, or
(d)
any flooding or increased flooding of any such lands,
which is caused by, or results from, the construction of any specified work or any act or omission of the nominated undertaker, its contractors, agents or employees whilst engaged upon the work.
(2)
The drainage authority must give to the nominated undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of any such claim or demand is to be made without the consent of the nominated undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, is to have the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
49
Nothing in paragraph 48 requires the nominated undertaker to indemnify the drainage authority in respect of any claim, demand, proceedings or damages which the drainage authority could reasonably make, take against or recover from any other person.
50
The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done in accordance with a plan approved or deemed to be approved by the drainage authority, or to its satisfaction, or in accordance with any determination under paragraph 51, does not (in the absence of negligence on the part of the drainage authority, its officers, contractors or agents) relieve the nominated undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this Part.
51
Any dispute arising between the nominated undertaker and the drainage authority under this Part is to be determined by arbitration.

is to be deemed to have been given if it is neither given nor refused (with an indication of the grounds for refusal) within 28 days of the submission of the plans for approval or where further particulars are submitted under sub-paragraph (1), within 28 days of the submission of those particulars; and
(b)
may be given subject to such reasonable requirements as Canal & River Trust may make for the purpose of ensuring the safety or stability of the canal, including requirements as to the construction of protective works.
55
(1)
Any specified work, and any protective works required by Canal & River Trust under paragraph 54(3)(b), must be constructed with all reasonable despatch to the reasonable satisfaction of Canal & River Trust, and in such manner as to cause as little damage to the canal as may be reasonably practicable and as little interference as may be reasonably practicable with the passage of vessels using the canal and use of the towpath, and Canal & River Trust is to be entitled by its officer at all reasonable times, on giving such notice as may be reasonable in the circumstances, to inspect the construction of such work or works.
(2)
The nominated undertaker must give to Canal & River Trust not less than 28 days' notice of its intention to commence construction of any specified work or any protective works and also, except in emergency (when the nominated undertaker is to give such notice as may be reasonably practicable), of its intention to carry out any works for the repair or maintenance of any specified work insofar as such works of repair or maintenance affect or interfere with the canal.
56
(1)
The nominated undertaker must not deposit any polluting material on, in or over the canal and must not without the consent of Canal & River Trust—

In its application to the discharge of water into the canal, paragraph 10(5) of Schedule 2 has effect subject to the terms of any conditions attached to the consent under paragraph 56(2) and, where such discharge includes a deposit to which consent has been given under paragraph 56(1), to any conditions attached to that consent.
58
(1)
If as a result of the construction of any specified work any part of the towpath or access way beside the canal, or any public right of way giving access to that path or way, is temporarily closed to pedestrians or cyclists and there is no way which provides a reasonable alternative, the nominated undertaker must, so far as reasonably practicable and to the extent that it is consistent with safety, provide a substitute path or paths for such time as the closure continues.
(2)
This paragraph is without prejudice to the requirements of paragraph 8(2) or (5) of Schedule 4.

(2)
If any canal work is in such condition that it is, or is likely to become, a danger to or to interfere with navigation, Canal & River Trust may by notice require the nominated undertaker to take such reasonable steps as may be specified in the notice—
(a)
to repair and restore the work or part of it, or
(b)
if the nominated undertaker so elects, to remove the work and (to such extent as Canal & River Trust reasonably requires) to restore the site to its former condition.
(3)
If—
(a)
a work which consists of a canal work and a non-canal work is abandoned or falls into decay; and
(b)
the non-canal work is in such a condition as to interfere with the right of navigation in the relevant canal or as to interfere with the rights of access or use of land adjacent to the relevant canal,
Canal & River Trust may include the non-canal work, or any part of it, in any notice under this paragraph.
(4)
If after such reasonable period as may be specified in a notice under this paragraph the nominated undertaker has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the requirements of the notice or after beginning has failed to make reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, Canal & River Trust may carry out the works specified in the notice and any expenditure reasonably incurred by it in so doing is to be recoverable from the nominated undertaker.
(5)
In this paragraph “canal work” means so much of any specified work or any other work of which the nominated undertaker is in possession under the powers of this Act as is in or over a canal owned or managed by Canal & River Trust and “non-canal work” means so much of any such work as is not in or over a canal.

(1)
The nominated undertaker must indemnify Canal & River Trust from all claims, demands, proceedings or damages, which may be made or given against, or recovered from Canal & River Trust by reason of any damage to the canal which is caused by the construction of any specified work or protective work or any act or omission of the nominated undertaker, its contractors, agents or employees whilst engaged upon the work and from any costs reasonably incurred in making good such damage.
(2)
Canal & River Trust must give to the nominated undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of any such claim or demand is to be made without the consent of the nominated undertaker which, if it notifies Canal & River Trust that it desires to do so, is to have the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

(1)
Nothing in paragraph 60 is to impose any liability on the nominated undertaker with respect to any damage to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Canal & River Trust, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(2)
But the fact that any work or thing has been executed or done in accordance with a plan approved or deemed to be approved by Canal & River Trust, or to its satisfaction, or in accordance with a determination under paragraph 62, does not (in the absence of negligence on the part of Canal & River Trust, its officers, servants, contractors or agents) relieve the nominated undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this Part.

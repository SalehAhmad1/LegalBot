(b)
has not been released on licence.
(2)
An offence is within this subsection (whether it was committed before or after this section comes into force) if—

(b)
it is specified in Part 2 of that Schedule and was determined by the court to have had a terrorist connection under section 30 or (in the case of a person sentenced in Scotland but now subject to the provisions of this Chapter) section 31 of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 (sentences for certain offences with a terrorist connection), or
(c)
it is a service offence as respects which the corresponding civil offence is an offence specified in Part 2 of that Schedule and was determined by the service court to have had a terrorist connection under section 32 of that Act (sentences for certain offences with a terrorist connection: armed forces).
(3)
It is the duty of the Secretary of State to refer the case of a terrorist prisoner to the Board—
(a)
as soon as the prisoner has served the requisite custodial period, and

“service offence”, “corresponding civil offence” and “service court” have the same meanings as in the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 (see section 95 of that Act).
(9)
For the purposes of this section, a reference of a terrorist prisoner's case to the Board disposed of before the day on which this section comes into force is to be treated as if it was made (and disposed of) under subsection (3) if—
(a)
it was made under section 244A(2)(b) and disposed of at a time when the prisoner had served the requisite custodial sentence (within the meaning of this section, not section 244A), or
(b)
it was made under section 246A(4).

[30th January 2020]
Be it enacted by the Queen's most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—1
Incorporation of EU legislation governing the CAP direct payment schemes
(1)
On exit day the EU legislation governing the 2020 CAP direct payment schemes becomes part of domestic law.
(2)
In subsection (1), “the EU legislation governing the 2020 CAP direct payment schemes” means the EU legislation listed in subsection (3)—
(a)
as it has effect in EU law immediately before exit day for the claim year 2020, and
(b)

(3)
The EU legislation mentioned in subsection (2) is—

(b)
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 639/2014 of 11 March 2014 supplementing the Direct Payments Regulation;
(c)

(4)
This section brings that EU legislation into domestic law only in the form of the English language version of that legislation, but this does not affect the use of other language versions for the purposes of interpretation.
(5)
This section does not affect any rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions or other matters arising in relation to the CAP direct payment schemes for the claim year 2019 or earlier claim years.
(6)
But for the purposes of any rights, powers, liabilities, obligations, restrictions or other matters arising in relation to the CAP direct payment schemes for the claim year 2020, that EU legislation is to be treated as if it had formed part of domestic law from the beginning of 2020.
(7)
In this Act—
“CAP direct payment schemes” means the support schemes under the Direct Payments Regulation;
“claim year” means a period of 12 months beginning with 1 January (and “claim year”, followed by a year, means the period of 12 months beginning with 1 January in that year);
the “Direct Payments Regulation” means Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy;
the “Horizontal Regulation” means Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy.2
Interpretation and status
(1)
Section 6 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (interpretation) applies for the purposes of this Act as it applies for the purposes of that Act and, in particular, it applies when a court or tribunal is deciding a question as to the validity, meaning or effect of [F1assimilated] law governing the CAP direct payment schemes as it applies when a court or tribunal is deciding a question as to the validity, meaning or effect of [F2assimilated law within the meaning given by that section].
(2)
In its application as mentioned in subsection (1), section 6 of that Act has effect with the modifications in subsections (5) and (6).
(3)
The following provisions of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 apply in relation to the modification by domestic law of [F3assimilated direct] CAP legislation as they apply in relation to the modification by domestic law of [F4assimilated direct legislation within the meaning given by section 20(1) of that Act] —
(a)
section 7(2) and (3) (modification of retained direct EU legislation), and
(b)
paragraphs 3 to 8 and [F511A] to 12 of Schedule 8 (existing and future powers to make subordinate legislation).
(4)
In their application as mentioned in subsection (3), the provisions mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) have effect with the modifications in subsection (5).
(5)
To the extent that they are applied for the purposes of subsections (1) and (3), the provisions of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in question have effect as if any reference in them to an expression listed in the first column of the following Table were a reference to the corresponding expression in the second column.

(6)
In the definitions in section 6(7) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 of “[F10assimilated] domestic case law” [F11and] “[F10assimilated] EU case law” F12... (as applied for the purposes of subsection (1) above)—
(a)
references to anything to which section [F132 or 3] of that Act applies are to be read as references to anything to which the EU legislation listed in section 1(3) of this Act applies, and
(b)
references to the principles and decisions excluded by section 5 of, or Schedule 1 to, that Act are to be read as references to the principles and decisions that would be excluded if that Act were to operate to save and incorporate EU law with exceptions on exit day (instead of IP completion day).

(a)
[F14assimilated] law governing the CAP direct payment schemes, and
(b)

section 6 of that Act applies with the modifications made by this section so far as the question relates to the validity, meaning or effect of the subordinate legislation as [F14assimilated] law governing the CAP direct payment schemes.
(8)
For the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998—
(a)
the Direct Payments Regulation and the Horizontal Regulation so far as they form part of domestic law by virtue of section 1(1) are to be treated as primary legislation, and
(b)
other [F15assimilated direct] CAP legislation is to be treated as primary legislation so far as it amends any primary legislation but otherwise is to be treated as subordinate legislation.
(9)
In subsection (8), “amend”, “primary legislation” and “subordinate legislation” have the same meaning as in the Human Rights Act 1998.
(10)
In this Act—
“[F16assimilated] law governing the CAP direct payment schemes” means—

“[F17assimilated direct] CAP legislation” means the EU legislation listed in section 1(3) that forms part of domestic law by virtue of section 1(1) (as modified by domestic law from time to time, and including any instruments made under it on or after exit day).
(11)
The following provisions come into force (to the extent that they are not already in force) for the purposes of their application under this section at the same time as this section comes into force—

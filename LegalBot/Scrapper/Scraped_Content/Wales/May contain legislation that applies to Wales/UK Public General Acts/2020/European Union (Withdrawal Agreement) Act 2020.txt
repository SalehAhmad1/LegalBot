(8)
Regulations to which this paragraph applies which are made jointly with a Northern Ireland department on or after exit day are subject to negative resolution within the meaning of section 41(6) of the Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 as if they were a statutory instrument within the meaning of that Act.
(9)
If in accordance with this paragraph—
(a)
either House of Parliament resolves that an address be presented to Her Majesty praying that an instrument be annulled, or
(b)
a relevant devolved legislature resolves that an instrument be annulled,
nothing further is to be done under the instrument after the date of the resolution and Her Majesty may by Order in Council revoke the instrument.
(10)
In sub-paragraph (9) “relevant devolved legislature” means—
(a)
in the case of regulations made jointly with the Scottish Ministers, the Scottish Parliament,
(b)
in the case of regulations made jointly with the Welsh Ministers, the National Assembly for Wales, and
(c)
in the case of regulations made jointly with a Northern Ireland department, the Northern Ireland Assembly.
(11)
Sub-paragraph (9) does not affect the validity of anything previously done under the instrument or prevent the making of a new instrument.
(12)
Sub-paragraphs (9) to (11) apply in place of provision made by any other enactment about the effect of such a resolution.10
(1)
Regulations made by the Scottish Ministers under paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 5 on or after exit day are subject to the negative procedure (see section 28 of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010).

A statutory instrument containing regulations made by the Welsh Ministers under paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 5 on or after exit day is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the National Assembly for Wales.
(3)
Regulations made by a Northern Ireland department under paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 5 on or after exit day are subject to negative resolution within the meaning of section 41(6) of the Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 as if they were a statutory instrument within the meaning of that Act.11
(1)
Any power to make regulations under this Act—
(a)
so far as exercisable by a Minister of the Crown or by a Minister of the Crown acting jointly with a devolved authority, is exercisable by statutory instrument,
(b)
so far as exercisable by the Welsh Ministers or by the Welsh Ministers acting jointly with a Minister of the Crown, is exercisable by statutory instrument, and
(c)
so far as exercisable by a Northern Ireland department (other than when acting jointly with a Minister of the Crown), is exercisable by statutory rule for the purposes of the Statutory Rules (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 (SI 1979/1573 (NI 12)) (and not by statutory instrument).
(2)
For regulations made under this Act by the Scottish Ministers, see also section 27 of the Interpretation and Legislative Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 (asp 10) (Scottish statutory instruments).12
Any power to make regulations under this Act—
(a)
may be exercised so as to make different provision for different cases or descriptions of case, different circumstances, different purposes or different areas, and
(b)
includes power to make supplementary, incidental, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision.13
The fact that a power to make regulations is conferred by this Act does not affect the extent of any other power to make regulations under this Act.14
Any power to make regulations under this Act in relation to the withdrawal agreement, the EEA EFTA separation agreement or the Swiss citizens' rights agreement, or any modification of any of them which requires ratification, is capable of being exercised before the agreement or (as the case may be) modification concerned is ratified.15
The power of a Minister of the Crown under section 42(7) to appoint a day includes a power to appoint a time on that day if the Minister considers it appropriate to do so.16
If an instrument, or a draft of an instrument, containing regulations under this Act would, apart from this paragraph, be treated as a hybrid instrument for the purposes of the standing orders of either House of Parliament, it is to proceed in that House as if it were not a hybrid instrument.17
(1)
Sub-paragraph (2) applies to a statutory instrument containing regulations under this Act which is subject to a procedure before Parliament for the approval of the instrument in draft before it is made or its approval after it is made.
(2)
The statutory instrument may also include regulations under this Act or another enactment which are made by statutory instrument which is subject to a procedure before Parliament that provides for the annulment of the instrument after it has been made.
(3)
Where regulations are included as mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), the procedure applicable to the statutory instrument is the procedure mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) and not the procedure mentioned in sub-paragraph (2).
(4)
Sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) apply in relation to a statutory instrument containing regulations under this Act which is subject to a procedure before the National Assembly for Wales as they apply in relation to a statutory instrument containing regulations under this Act which is subject to a procedure before Parliament but as if the references to Parliament were references to the National Assembly for Wales.
(5)
Sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) apply in relation to a statutory rule as they apply in relation to a statutory instrument but as if the references to Parliament were references to the Northern Ireland Assembly.
(6)
Sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) apply in relation to a statutory instrument containing regulations under this Act which is subject to a procedure before the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly as well as a procedure before Parliament as they apply to a statutory instrument containing regulations under this Act which is subject to a procedure before Parliament but as if the references to Parliament were references to Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales or (as the case may be) the Northern Ireland Assembly.
(7)
This paragraph does not prevent the inclusion of other regulations in a statutory instrument or statutory rule which contains regulations under this Act (and, accordingly, references in this Schedule to an instrument containing regulations are to be read as references to an instrument containing (whether alone or with other provision) regulations).1
(1)
Any provision in subordinate legislation made before exit day under—
(a)
any provision of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (or any provision made under any such provision), or
(b)
any other enactment,
which provides, by reference to exit day (however expressed), for all or part of that or any other subordinate legislation to come into force immediately before exit day, on exit day or at any time after exit day is to be read instead as providing for the subordinate legislation or (as the case may be) the part to come into force immediately before IP completion day, on IP completion day or (as the case may be) at the time concerned after IP completion day.
(2)
Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply so far as it is expressly disapplied by the subordinate legislation that provides as mentioned in that sub-paragraph.
(3)
An appropriate authority may by regulations—
(a)
provide for sub-paragraph (1) not to apply to any extent in particular cases or descriptions of case, or
(b)
make different provision in particular cases or descriptions of case to that made by sub-paragraph (1).
(4)
But see paragraph 2 for further provision about the power of a devolved authority acting alone to make regulations under sub-paragraph (3).
(5)
No regulations may be made under sub-paragraph (3) after the end of the period of one year beginning with IP completion day.
(6)

a devolved authority, or
(c)
a Minister of the Crown acting jointly with a devolved authority.

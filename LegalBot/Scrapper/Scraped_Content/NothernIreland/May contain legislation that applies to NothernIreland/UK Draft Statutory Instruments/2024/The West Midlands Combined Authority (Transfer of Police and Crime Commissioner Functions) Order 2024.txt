(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes provision for the transfer of police and crime commissioner (“PCC”) functions from the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands to the Mayor of the West Midlands (“the Mayor”).
Article 3 provides for the transfer of functions to the Mayor, and the abolition of the PCC for the West Midlands.
Article 4 provides that, in relation to the Mayor’s PCC functions, the Mayor is to be treated as a PCC for the purposes of all legislation affecting PCCs. Schedule 1 sets out modifications of such legislation in its application to the Mayor and Schedule 2 lists certain legislation that does not apply.
Articles 5 to 9 make provision in relation to the transfer of property, rights and liabilities from the PCC for the West Midlands to the West Midlands Combined Authority. The Mayor is to exercise all functions and make all decisions in relation to such property, rights and liabilities.
Article 10 extends the period under the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 (c. 2) in which a statement of accounts must be prepared. Article 11 applies and modifies section 86 of the Local Government Act 1972 (c. 70) to provide for circumstances where the Mayor is unable to act as Mayor for more than six months. Article 12 makes amendments to legislation consequential on this Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

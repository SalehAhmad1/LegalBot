DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the meaning of “ivory” in section 37 of the Ivory Act 2018 (c. 30) (“the Act”) and make miscellaneous amendments to the Ivory Prohibitions (Exemptions) (Process and Procedure) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/94) and the Ivory Prohibition (Civil Sanctions) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/311). The Act currently prohibits dealing in elephant ivory only, subject to exemptions and exceptions.
Regulation 2 amends section 37 of the Act to extend the definition of “ivory” (and so the prohibitions in dealing with ivory under the Act) from “the tusk or tooth of an elephant” to “the tusk or tooth” of any of an elephant, a common hippopotamus, a killer whale, a narwhal or a sperm whale.
Regulation 3 amends the Ivory Prohibitions (Exemptions) (Process and Procedure) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/94) to give the formal names of five prescribed institutions who may provide the Secretary of State with advice on applications for exemption certificates.
Regulation 4 amends the Ivory Prohibition (Civil Sanctions) Regulations (S.I. 2022/311) to make consistent the use of the terms referring to service throughout those Regulations.

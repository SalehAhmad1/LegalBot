(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes changes to electoral arrangements for Gloucestershire following recommendations made by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England. This Order does not change the boundary of Gloucestershire itself.
Article 3 abolishes the existing electoral divisions of Gloucestershire and replaces them with the 55 new ones listed in Schedule 1 for the purpose of elections held on or after the ordinary day of election of councillors in England in 2025. It also establishes the names and areas of the new electoral divisions and the number of councillors for each.
Articles 4 and 5 make changes to parish wards that are consequential on the changes made by article 3. The changes to parish wards introduced by articles 4 and 5 come into force for the purpose of parish elections in 2027 and 2028 respectively, and subsequent parish elections.
The area covered by each division created by this Order is identified on a map which is available for inspection at reasonable times at the offices of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, 1st Floor, Windsor House, 50 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0TL.

“Appropriate suppliers of naloxone products
237A.—(1) Regulations 214(1) and 220 do not apply to the supply of a naloxone product by an individual who is an appropriate supplier of naloxone products, if it is for an appropriate purpose.
(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the following are appropriate suppliers of naloxone products—

a pharmacist,
(ii)
in England, Wales or Scotland, a registered pharmacy technician,
(iii)
a registered nurse,
(iv)
a registered midwife, or
(v)
a registered paramedic,
if that person has undergone appropriate training in the storage and supply of naloxone products; and
(e)
a person employed or engaged by a local naloxone provider, if that local naloxone provider is satisfied that the person has undergone appropriate training in the storage and supply of naloxone products.
(3) For the purposes of this regulation, a local naloxone provider is an entity that has valid arrangements in place (“local naloxone arrangements”) with a naloxone supply network co-ordinator for the supply of naloxone products for an appropriate purpose.
(4) For the purposes of this regulation, a naloxone supply network co-ordinator is an entity that has valid arrangements in place (“network creation arrangements”) with an appropriate national body as part of which the naloxone supply network co-ordinator creates and maintains a network of local naloxone providers that are willing to supply naloxone products for an appropriate purpose.
(5) For—
(a)
local naloxone arrangements to be valid, a naloxone supply network co-ordinator must ensure that any putative local naloxone arrangements that it has contain arrangements that ensure; and
(b)
network creation arrangements to be valid, the appropriate national body must ensure that any putative network creation arrangements that it has contain arrangements that ensure,
the outcomes listed in paragraph (6).
(6) Those outcomes are—
(a)
that only persons who are employed or engaged by the putative local naloxone provider and who have undergone appropriate training in the storage and supply of naloxone products are able to supply them under the putative local naloxone arrangements;
(b)
that any requirements that the appropriate national body has in respect of training in the storage and supply of naloxone products which are relevant to supply in accordance with this regulation are included in the putative local naloxone arrangements, and any such requirements are appropriate training for the purposes of paragraph (2)(e) (but see paragraph (8));
(c)
that a record is kept by the putative local naloxone provider of all the persons employed or engaged by them who are able to supply naloxone products under the putative local naloxone arrangements, and of their relevant training;
(d)
that the putative local naloxone provider has a named individual responsible at all times for—
(i)
the storage, any handling relating to storage and any handling relating to supply of naloxone products by or on behalf of the putative local naloxone provider under their putative local naloxone arrangements, and
(ii)
the maintenance of appropriate records of those activities by the putative local naloxone provider;
(e)
that any requirements that the appropriate national body has in respect of storage and any handling relating to supply of naloxone products by local naloxone providers, which arise out of or relate to supply in accordance with this regulation, are included in the putative local naloxone arrangements; and
(f)
that any requirements that the appropriate national body has in respect of the processing of information by local naloxone providers, including in respect of—
(i)
the records to be kept as part of local naloxone arrangements,
(ii)
the information to be derived from those records, and
(iii)
the provision of information to naloxone supply network co-ordinators, and the occasions on which and the frequency with which to do so,
which arise out of or relate to supply in accordance with this regulation, are included in the putative local naloxone arrangements.
(7) For network creation arrangements to be valid, the appropriate national body must also ensure that any putative network creation arrangements that it has contain arrangements that ensure the following outcomes—
(a)
that any requirements that the appropriate national body has in respect of the processing of information by naloxone supply network co-ordinators, including in respect of—
(i)
the records to be kept as part of the network creation arrangements,
(ii)
the information to be derived from those records, and
(iii)
the provision of information to the appropriate national body, and the occasions on which and the frequency with which to do so,
which arise out of or relate to supply in accordance with this regulation, are included in the putative network creation arrangements; and
(b)
that any requirements that the appropriate national body has in respect of who may be a local naloxone provider, and how their status as such is recorded or advertised, are included in the putative network creation arrangements.
(8) In order for training in the storage and supply of naloxone products to be appropriate for the purposes of this regulation, its outcome must be that a person completing the training successfully (T) has the following competencies—
(a)
understanding of the legal framework for supply in accordance with this regulation which is sufficient for the purposes of ensuring that T is able to administer naloxone products lawfully and where appropriate to supply them to another person for that other person to administer them lawfully, having been trained to do so by T;
(b)
understanding of the safe storage and safe handling of naloxone products which is sufficient for the purposes of ensuring—
(i)
that T is able to store and handle naloxone products safely and without compromising their efficacy, and
(ii)
if T is to supply those products to another person for that other person to store and handle them, that the other person is able to store and handle them safely, and without compromising their efficacy, having been trained to do so by T; and
(c)
understanding of how and when to administer naloxone products which is sufficient for the purposes of ensuring—
(i)
that T is able to do so safely, effectively and when appropriate, and
(ii)
if T is to supply those products to another person for that other person to administer them, that the other person is able to administer them safely, effectively and when appropriate, having been trained to do so by T,
and if the appropriate national body for where a supply takes place has determined that that is the outcome of particular training for a particular (or any) category of person, then for where that supply takes place that determination is conclusive evidence, or in Scotland sufficient evidence, that the training is appropriate training for that category of person.
(9) The following are appropriate purposes for the purposes of this regulation—
(a)
the naloxone product is needed by the person to whom or for whom it is supplied for the purpose of saving life in an emergency;
(b)
in the reasonable expectation of the appropriate supplier of naloxone, the supply of the naloxone product is to enable it to be kept at a place where a person resides or which they frequent, in circumstances where that person may need, at that place—
(i)
to administer it to themselves in an emergency for the purposes of saving their own life, or
(ii)
to administer it to another person, or to have it administered to them, in accordance with regulation 238; or
(c)
in the reasonable expectation of the appropriate supplier of naloxone, the supply of the naloxone product is to enable it to be carried about by the person to or for whom it is supplied, that person being a person who may need it—
(i)
to administer it to themselves in an emergency for the purposes of saving their own life, or
(ii)
to administer it to another person, or to have it administered to them, in accordance with regulation 238.
(10) Where, pursuant to this regulation, an appropriate supplier of naloxone mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) to (d) supplies a naloxone product—
(a)
that appropriate supplier of naloxone;
(b)
a provider of drug treatment services, medical services or other health care services that employs or engages the appropriate supplier of naloxone, if it is the entity that supplied the supplier with the naloxone product; or
(c)
a body listed in paragraph (2)(a) or (c), where that body provided or commissioned the drug treatment services or other health care services as part of which the appropriate supplier of naloxone supplied the naloxone product,
may provide an appropriate national body with any information about that supply, if that type of information, or information derived from that type of information, is information that a naloxone supply network co-ordinator would be required to supply to that body under network creation arrangements, it (or the information derived from it) being information included in requirements that the appropriate national body has as mentioned in paragraph (7)(a)(iii).
(11) For the purposes of section 8(c) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (lawfulness of processing: public interest etc)(1), provision of information in the circumstances described in paragraph (10) is to be considered necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
(12) For the purposes of this regulation, the following are appropriate national bodies—
(a)
in England, the Secretary of State;
(b)
in Scotland, the Scottish Ministers;
(c)
in Wales, the Welsh Ministers or Public Health Wales;
(d)
in Northern Ireland, the Public Health Agency or the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.
(13) For the purposes of this regulation and regulation 238, any use of a naloxone product that is indicated in a marketing authorisation for the product is to be treated as being for the purpose of saving life, even if the use is for, or partially for, diagnosis.”.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (“the 2012 Regulations”), which govern the arrangements across the United Kingdom for the licensing, manufacture, wholesale dealing and sale or supply of medicines for human use.
A number of the amendments make provision about the supply of medicinal products containing naloxone or its salts, esters or stereoisomeric forms (“naloxone products”) which are prescription only medicines. Naloxone products are used in the diagnosis and treatment of cases of acute overdose or intoxication caused by natural or synthetic opioids.
Prior to these Regulations, limited provision had previously been made to allow people working for drug treatment services to benefit, when supplying naloxone hydrochloride, from an exemption from the ordinary restrictions in the 2012 Regulations on the supply of prescription only medicines. That exemption allowed people working for drug treatment services to supply naloxone hydrochloride without being authorised prescribers. New exemptions introduced by these Regulations also allow people working for the police, prison services, probation services and youth justice services – as well as a list of registered health care professionals – to supply the broader range of naloxone products, provided those individuals have undergone appropriate training. A new exemption is also created for the medical services of His Majesty’s forces.
A further new exemption is created for a new type of entity, referred to as local naloxone providers, whose workers will also benefit from the new exemptions. These local naloxone providers will be part of networks, run on behalf of central government and the devolved administrations by entities that agree to act as naloxone supply network co-ordinators. The local naloxone arrangements that are to govern the local supply are required to cover a list of issues that includes appropriate training, the storage and handling of naloxone products and record keeping. Specific provision has also been made for the transfer of information to specified national bodies.
Provision has also been made to allow specified national bodies to set national standards for training in the storage and supply of naloxone products nationally.
Supplies of naloxone by all the individuals coming within these exemptions will need to be for a specified purpose. Prior to these Regulations, under the exemption that was just for drug treatment services, the permitted purpose for supply was limited to the actual saving of life in an emergency, but under the new arrangements, suppliers will be able to supply “take home” naloxone products, and to supply naloxone products to be carried about, for example by police officers, in case they are needed (regulations 3 and 7).
The earlier more limited exemption for drug treatment services has been subsumed into the new exemption, allowing for its revocation (regulations 9(b) and 11). The list of products that may be parenterally administered in an emergency has been updated so that it now refers to naloxone products rather than simply naloxone hydrochloride (regulation 12).
An adjustment has been made to the powers of medicines manufacturers and wholesalers to allow them to supply naloxone products to providers that are part of the new arrangements (regulation 8).
Public Health England (PHE), which has been dissolved, was an executive agency of the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) – and many of its functions have been transferred to the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which is also an executive agency of DHSC. PHE’s functions that were specified in the 2012 Regulations, and those of its chief executive, which relate predominantly to the supply of prescription only medicines under patient group directions, have been transferred to the UKHSA and its chief executive (regulations 4(b) and (c), 5, 6, 9(a) and (c), 10 and 13).
Similarly, the functions of the Regional Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland which related to patient group directions have been transferred to the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. Regulation 4(a) of these Regulations amends a definition of “health authority” to make it clear that this transfer has taken place, although the transfer itself happened by virtue of a transitional provision in paragraph 1 of Part 2 of Schedule 4 to the Health and Social Care Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 (c. 3).
A Regulatory Triage Assessment of the effect of this instrument was undertaken and it was deemed that a full impact assessment would not be proportionate. These Regulations are not expected to have a significant impact on the public and voluntary sectors, and only a limited impact on the private sector, below the threshold for undertaking a full impact assessment.

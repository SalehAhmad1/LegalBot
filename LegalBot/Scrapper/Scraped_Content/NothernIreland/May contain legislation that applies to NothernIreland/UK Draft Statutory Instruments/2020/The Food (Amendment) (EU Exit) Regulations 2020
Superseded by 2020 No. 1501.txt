(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies, in particular under section 8(1) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and to take into account the position of Northern Ireland under the Northern Ireland Protocol under section 8C.
Part 2 amends the Food (Lot Marking) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/1502), the Food (Amendment) (England) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/150), the Food (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/529) and the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/778). These amendments adjust amendments made in those Regulations to take into account the position of Northern Ireland under the Northern Ireland Protocol in the agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union under Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union.
Part 3 amends retained direct EU legislation relating to food and drink.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

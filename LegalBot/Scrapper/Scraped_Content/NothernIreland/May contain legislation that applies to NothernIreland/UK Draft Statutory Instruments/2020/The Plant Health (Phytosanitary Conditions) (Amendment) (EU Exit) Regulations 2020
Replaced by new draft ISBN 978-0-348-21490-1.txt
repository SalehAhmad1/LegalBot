Interpretation
In this Annex:
‘competent authority’, in relation to plants for planting originating in a third country, means the national plant protection organisation of the country of origin or any official authority or body acting under the supervision of the national plant protection organisation;
‘RNQPs’ means GB regulated non-quarantine pests.
PART A
Measures to prevent the presence of RNQPs on fodder plant seed
1.  Inspection of the crop
(1) The competent authority, or the professional operator under the official supervision of the competent authority, must carry out field inspections on the crop from which the fodder plant seed is produced concerning the presence of RNQPs in the crop to ensure that the presence of RNQPs does not exceed the thresholds set out in the table in Part A of Annex 4.
(2) For the purposes of point (1), the competent authority may authorise inspectors, other than the professional operators, to carry out the field inspections on its behalf and under its official supervision.
(3) Field inspections may only be carried out when the condition and the stage of development of the crop allow for an adequate inspection. At least one field inspection must be carried out each year, at the most appropriate time for the detection of the respective RNQPs.
(4) The competent authority must determine the size, the number and the distribution of the portions of the field to be inspected in accordance with appropriate methods.
(5) The proportion of the crops for the production of seed to be officially inspected by the competent authority must be at least 5%.
2.  Sampling and testing of fodder plant seed
(1) The competent authority must:
(a)
officially draw seed samples from lots of fodder plant seed;
(b)
authorise seed samplers to carry out sampling on its behalf and under its official supervision;
(c)
compare the seed samples drawn by itself with those of the same seed lot drawn by the seed samplers under official supervision as referred to in point (b);
(d)
supervise the performance of the seed samplers provided for in point (2).
(2) The competent authority or the professional operator under official supervision must sample and test the fodder plant seed in accordance with up-to-date international methods.
(3) Except for automatic sampling, the competent authority must check a proportion of at least 5 % of the seed lots entered for official certification.
(4) That proportion must be as spread as evenly possible over natural and legal persons entering seed for certification, and the species entered, but may also be aimed at eliminating specific doubts.
(5) In the case of automatic sampling, appropriate procedures must be applied and the sampling must be officially supervised.
(6) For the examination of seed for certification, samples must be drawn from homogeneous lots and, as regards the lot and sample weights, in accordance with the table in Annex 3 to Directive 66/401/EEC.
3.  The competent authority, or the professional operator under the official supervision of the competent authority, must carry out checks and take any other action which is necessary or appropriate to ensure that the requirements specified in the following table in relation to the respective RNQPs and plants for planting are satisfied:
RNQPs or symptoms caused by RNQPs Plants for planting (genus or species) Requirements
Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. insidiosus Pre-basic, basic and certified seeds of Medicago sativa L.
(a)
the seeds originate in areas known to be free from Clavibacter michiganensis spp. insidiosus,
(b)
the crop has been grown on land on which no previous Medicago sativa L. crop was present during the last three years prior to sowing, and no symptoms of Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. insidiosus have been observed during any field inspection at the site of production or no symptoms of Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. insidiosus have been observed on any Medicago sativa L. crop adjacent to it, during the previous cropping, or
(c)
the crop belongs to a variety recognised as being highly resistant to Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. insidiosus and the content of inert matter does not exceed 0.1% by weight
Ditylenchus dipsaci Pre-basic, basic and certified seeds of Medicago sativa L.
(a)
no symptoms of Ditylenchus dipsaci have been observed at the site of production during the previous cropping, no main host crops have been grown during the two preceding years on the site of production and appropriate hygiene measures have been taken to prevent infestation of the place of production,
(b)
no symptoms of Ditylenchus dipsaci have been observed at the site of production during the previous cropping and no Ditylenchus dipsaci has been found by laboratory tests on a representative sample, or
(c)
the seeds have been subjected to an appropriate physical or chemical treatment against Ditylenchus dipsaci and have been found to be free of this pest after laboratory tests on a representative sample.
PART B
Measures to prevent the presence of RNQPs on propagating material of Vitis sp.
The competent authority, or the professional operator under the official supervision of the competent authority, must carry out checks and take any other action which is necessary or appropriate to ensure that the requirements specified in the following table in relation to the respective RNQPs and plants for planting are satisfied:
Insects and mites
RNQPs or symptoms caused by RNQPs Plants for planting (genus or species) Requirements
Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch [VITEVI] Vitis vinifera L.
(a)
the plants have been produced in areas known to be free from Daktulosphaira vitifoliae Fitch,
(b)

(2) For the purposes of point (1), the competent authority may authorise inspectors, other than the professional operators, to carry out the field inspections on its behalf and under its official supervision.
(3) Those field inspections must be carried out when the condition and the stage of development of the crop allow for an adequate inspection. At least one field inspection must be carried out each year, at the most appropriate time for the detection of the respective RNQPs.
(4) The competent authority must determine the size, the number and the distribution of the portions of the field to be inspected in accordance with appropriate methods.
(5) The proportion of the crops for the production of seed to be officially inspected by the competent authority must be at least 5%.

compare the seed samples drawn by itself with those of the same seed lot drawn by the seed samplers under official supervision as referred to in point (b);
(d)
supervise the performance of the seed samplers.

(3) Except for automatic sampling, the competent authority must check a proportion of at least 5 % of the seed lots entered for official certification.
(4) That proportion must be spread as evenly as possible over natural and legal persons entering seed for certification and the species entered, but may also be aimed at eliminating specific doubts.
(5) In the case of automatic sampling, appropriate procedures must be applied and the sampling must be officially supervised.
(6) For the examination of seed for certification, samples must be drawn from homogeneous lots and, as regards the lot and sample weights, in accordance with the table in Annex 3 to Directive 66/401/EEC.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under sections 8(2)(a), 8(2)(b), 8(2)(e), 8(2)(g) and 8(3)(a) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of customs safety and security procedures, including about the registration of businesses, to ensure that the legislation continues to operate much as before, but in the context of the United Kingdom no longer being a member of the European Union.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument. Regulations 4(2)(h) and 7(3) will assist businesses by removing the administrative burden of submitting declarations for a six month period until 1 July 2021. An impact assessment is not required for provisions in force for less than 12 months. In relation to the remainder of regulations 4 and 7 and regulations 3, 5, 6, and 8, no significant impact on business, the public sector, charities or voluntary bodies is foreseen.

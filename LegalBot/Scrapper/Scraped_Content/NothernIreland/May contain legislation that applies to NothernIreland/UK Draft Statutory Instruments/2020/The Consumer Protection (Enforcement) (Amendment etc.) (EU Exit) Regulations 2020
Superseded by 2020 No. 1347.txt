DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c. 68) and section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16), in the latter case to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under sections 8(2)(c), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (enforcement of certain consumer legislation). The amendments specify the courts which are to be treated as having made an order under Part 8 where that order has been made by a court in another part of the United Kingdom. This amendment is made in consequence of the Fourteenth Report of session 2019-21 of the House of Lords and House of Commons Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments in relation to the Consumer Protection (Enforcement) (Amendment etc.) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/484).
Regulation 3 amends the Consumer Protection (Enforcement) (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/203) (“the 2019 EU Exit Regulations”). The amendments ensure that the 2019 EU Exit Regulations revoke Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (OJ L No. 345, 27.12.2017, p. 1), which has replaced Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (OJ L No. 364, 9.12.2004, p. 1), and take into account the changes made to domestic legislation by the Consumer Protection (Enforcement) (Amendment etc.) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/484). Regulation 3 also modifies the transitional provisions of the 2019 EU Exit Regulations.
Regulations 4 to 7 amend other Regulations dealing with consumer protection made under section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“other EU Exit Regulations”). These amendments are made in consequence of the inclusion of EU legislation relating to crystal glass, footwear and textile products in Annex 2 to the Protocol on Ireland / Northern Ireland of the EU withdrawal agreement. The purpose of the amendments is to remove Northern Ireland from arrangements that are due to take effect at the end of the transition period and to make consequential changes in respect of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Regulations 4 to 7 also replace references to “exit day” in the other EU Exit Regulations with “IP completion day” where necessary.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

82.  The exercise of any of the powers in this Chapter is to be treated as a “crisis management measure” under section 48Z of the Act.Suspension of obligations prior to exercise of stabilisation powers
83.—(1) The Bank of England may make an instrument suspending obligations to make a payment, or delivery, under a contract where one of the parties to the contract is a bank and the conditions specified in paragraph (2) are met in relation to the bank.
(2) These conditions are that:
(a)
the PRA has determined that Condition 1 in section 7 of the Act is met, having consulted the Bank of England;
(b)
the Bank of England has determined that no action referred to in Condition 2 in that section will be taken immediately, having consulted the PRA, the FCA and the Treasury;
(c)
the Bank of England has determined that the suspension would prevent further deterioration of the financial position of the bank, having consulted the PRA and the FCA;
(d)
the suspension—
(i)
would allow additional time for the Bank of England to determine whether Conditions 3 and 4 in section 7 of the Act are met;
(ii)
would allow additional time for determination of which stabilisation option is appropriate; or
(iii)
would assist with the effective exercise of one or more of the stabilisation powers.
(3) A suspension imposed under paragraph (1) does not apply to payments or deliveries to excluded persons.
(4) Subject to paragraph (3), a suspension imposed under subsection (1) suspends all obligations to make a payment or delivery under the contract in question, whether the obligation is that of the bank or of any other party to the contract.
(5) Before exercising the power in paragraph (1) the Bank of England must have regard to—
(a)
the impact a suspension might have on the orderly functioning of the financial markets; and
(b)
rules and supervisory and judicial powers to safeguard the rights of creditors (including equal treatment) in normal insolvency proceedings (in view of the potential application of such proceedings to the bank following a determination that Condition 3 or 4 in section 7 of the Act is not met).
(6) In paragraph (5)(b), “normal insolvency proceedings” has the meaning given in section 12AA of the Act.
(7) A suspension imposed under paragraph (1)—
(a)
must be as short in duration as is reasonably practicable;
(b)
begins when the instrument providing for the suspension is first published;
(c)
may not continue to apply after the end of the period that the Bank of England considers likely to be required to carry out the determinations referred to in paragraph (2)(c) and (d)(i) and (ii); and
(d)
in any event must end no later than midnight at the end of the first business day following the day on which the instrument providing for the suspension is published.
(8) Where a payment or delivery under the contract concerned would have fallen due within the period of the suspension, that payment or delivery obligation is treated as falling due immediately on the expiry of the suspension.Suspension of security interests prior to exercise of stabilisation powers
84.—(1) Where the Bank of England imposes a suspension under regulation 83(1) in respect of a bank, the Bank may make an instrument suspending the rights of a secured creditor of the bank to enforce any security interest the creditor has in relation to any assets of the bank.
(2) But the Bank of England may not suspend the rights of an excluded person to enforce any security interest that person may have in relation to any asset of the bank which has been pledged or provided to the excluded person in question as collateral or as cover for margin.
(3) The Bank of England must ensure that any restrictions on the enforcement of security interests which it imposes by virtue of paragraph (1) are applied consistently with any such restrictions imposed on a banking group company in the same group by virtue of regulation 88.
(4) The Bank of England must have regard to the impact a suspension might have on the orderly functioning of the financial markets before exercising the power in paragraph (1).
(5) A suspension under paragraph (1)—
(a)
begins when the suspension under regulation 83(1) begins; and
(b)
ends when the suspension under regulation 83(1) ends.
(6) For the purposes of this regulation, a “security interest” means an interest or right held for the purpose of securing the payment of money or the performance of any other obligation.Suspension of termination rights prior to exercise of stabilisation powers
85.—(1) Where the Bank of England imposes a suspension under regulation 83(1) in respect of a bank, the Bank may make an instrument suspending the termination rights of any party to a qualifying contract (other than a party who is an excluded person).
(2) A contract is a “qualifying contract” for the purpose of this regulation if—
(a)
one of the parties to the contract is the bank and all the obligations under the contract to make a payment, make a delivery or provide collateral continue to be performed; or
(b)
one of the parties to the contract is a subsidiary undertaking of the bank and the condition in paragraph (3) is met.
(3) The condition is that—
(a)
the obligations of the subsidiary undertaking are guaranteed or otherwise supported by the bank,
(b)
the termination rights under the contract are triggered by the insolvency or the financial condition of the bank; and
(c)
if a property transfer instrument may be made in relation to the bank—
(i)
all the assets and liabilities relating to the contract have been or are being transferred to, or assumed by, a single transferee; or
(ii)
the Bank of England is providing adequate protection for the performance of the obligations of the subsidiary undertaking under the contract in any other way.
(4) The Bank of England must have regard to the impact a suspension might have on the orderly functioning of the financial markets before exercising the power in paragraph (1).
(5) A suspension under paragraph (1)—
(a)
begins when the suspension under regulation 83(1) begins; and
(b)
ends when the suspension under regulation 83(1) ends.
(6) A person may exercise a termination right under a contract before the expiry of the suspension if that person is given notice by the Bank of England that the rights and liabilities of the bank covered by the contract are not—
(a)
to be transferred to another undertaking through the exercise of a stabilisation power; or
(b)
to be made subject to a mandatory reduction instrument or a resolution instrument.
(7) If—
(a)
no notice has been given by the Bank of England under paragraph (6); and
(b)
a termination right has been triggered otherwise than through the exercise of a stabilisation power or the imposition of a suspension under paragraph (1) (or the occurrence of an event directly linked to the exercise of a stabilisation power),
a person may, on the expiry of the suspension, exercise the termination right in accordance with the terms of the contract.
(8) But, where the rights and liabilities of the bank or the subsidiary undertaking under the contract have been transferred to another undertaking, paragraph (7) applies only if the event giving rise to the termination right has been triggered by that undertaking.
(9) For the purposes of this regulation, “termination right” means—
(a)
a right to terminate a contract;
(b)
a right to accelerate, close out, set-off or net obligations, or any similar provision that suspends, modifies or extinguishes an obligation of a party to the contract; or
(c)
a provision that prevents an obligation from arising under the contract.Suspension prior to exercise of stabilisation powers: procedure

(c)
make payments on Additional Tier 1 instruments.
(5) Before exercising the power under paragraph (4) the Bank of England must—
(a)
consult the competent authority;
(b)
carry out an assessment of—
(i)
the reasons for, and the duration and magnitude of, the failure, and its impact on the resolvability of the relevant person;
(ii)
the development of the relevant person’s financial situation and the likelihood of Condition 1 provided for in section 7 of the Banking Act 2009 being fulfilled in relation to it, or a bank in the same group, in the foreseeable future;
(iii)
the prospect that the relevant person will within a reasonable time frame be able to meet the combined buffer requirement without relying upon own funds and eligible liabilities that it relies upon also for the purposes of meeting the requirement under section 3A(4) of the Banking Act 2009;
(iv)
where the relevant person is unable to replace liabilities that no longer meet the eligibility or maturity criteria laid down in Articles 72b and 72c of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, whether that inability is idiosyncratic or is due to market wide disturbance;

(7) If—
(a)
failure continues for nine months after notification is given under paragraph (3); and
(b)
not more than one of the conditions specified in paragraph (8) is met;
(c)
the Bank of England must exercise its power under paragraph (4).
(8) The conditions are that the Bank of England assesses that—
(a)
the failure is due to a serious disturbance to the functioning of financial markets which leads to broad-based market stress across more than one segment of financial markets;
(b)
the disturbance not only results in the increased price volatility of the own funds and eligible liabilities of the relevant person or increased costs for the entity, but also leads to a full or partial closure of markets which prevents the relevant person from issuing own funds and eligible liabilities on those markets;
(c)
the closure of markets is observed not only for the relevant person, but also for at least several other entities;
(d)
the disturbance prevents the relevant person from issuing sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities to end the failure;
(e)
exercise of the power would lead to negative spill-over effects for at least one part of the banking sector, thereby potentially undermining financial stability.
(9) Where at least two of the conditions specified in paragraph (8) are met the Bank of England must—
(a)
notify the competent authority and explain its assessment in writing;
(b)
review its assessment under paragraph (8) at intervals of no more than one month.
(10) When the Bank of England is satisfied that the failure has ended the Bank of England must without delay notify the relevant person that the prohibition under paragraph (4) has ceased to have effect.
(11) For the purposes of paragraph (4) the maximum distributable amount is to be calculated by multiplying the sum calculated in accordance with paragraph (12) by the factor determined in accordance with paragraph (13).
(12) The sum referred to in paragraph (11) is A + B – C, where—
“A” is any interim profits not included in Common Equity Tier 1 instruments pursuant to Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, net of any distribution of profits or any payment resulting from the actions referred to in paragraph (4);
“B” is any year-end profits not included in Common Equity Tier 1 instruments pursuant to Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, net of any such distribution of profits or payment;
“C” is amounts which would be payable by tax if A and B were to be retained.
(13) The factor referred to in paragraph (11) is determined as follows—
(a)
where the Common Equity Tier 1 instruments maintained by the relevant person which are not used to meet any of the requirements set out in Article 92a of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and under section 3A(4) of the Banking Act 2009, expressed as a percentage of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, are within the first (that is, the lowest) quartile of the combined buffer requirement, the factor shall be 0;
(b)
where the Common Equity Tier 1 instruments maintained by the relevant person which are not used to meet any such requirements are within the second quartile of the combined buffer requirement, the factor shall be 0.2;
(c)
where the Common Equity Tier 1 instruments maintained by the relevant person which are not used to meet any such requirements are within the third quartile of the combined buffer requirement, the factor shall be 0.4;
(d)
the Common Equity Tier 1 instruments maintained by the relevant person which are not used to meet any such requirements are within the fourth (that is, the highest) quartile of the combined buffer requirement, the factor shall be 0.6.
(14) For the purposes of paragraph (13) the lower bound of quartile and upper bound of quartile are calculated as follows—
Where—
‘Qn’ is the ordinal number of the quartile concerned.
(15) The maximum distributable amount is not reduced by any amount resulting from any of the actions referred to in paragraph (4).

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement Directive (EU) 2019/879 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20th May 2019 amending Directive 2014/59/EU as regards the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity of credit institutions and investment firms and Directive 98/26/EC (O.J. L150, 7.6.2019, p296).
Chapter 1 of Part 2 extends existing rule making powers of the Financial Conduct Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (c.8). This will empower the FCA to implement restrictions placed by Directive 2014/59 (“BRRD”) on the selling of subordinated eligible liabilities to retail clients. These are a type of liability which relevant persons may be required by the Bank of England (“the Bank”) to maintain or issue.
Chapter 2 of Part 2 amends the Banking Act 2009 (c.1) which is the principal primary legislation upon which the UK relies for compliance with its obligations under the BRRD.
Regulations 5 to 8 amend the Bank’s powers to direct relevant persons to maintain a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (“MREL”) and enable it to write-down or convert internal liabilities in specified circumstances where a bank is not a resolution entity, but is in a resolution group. Regulation 10 exempts two new categories of liability from the exercise of a power to make special bail-in provision in relation to a bank. Regulation 24 makes provision equivalent to regulation 5 (which concerns banks established in the United Kingdom) for UK branches of third-country institutions, and regulation 18 sets out the type of mandatory reduction provision that may be made in exercise of the powers conferred by regulation 7.
Regulation 13 specifies additional circumstances where mandatory write-down or conversion of capital instruments and internal liabilities must take place in relation to a banking group company, and regulations 14 and 15 confer supplemental powers on the Bank to sell all or part of the business of a specified type of banking group company to a commercial purchaser, or to transfer it to a bridge bank or an asset management vehicle. Regulation 16 also confers on the Bank supplemental “bail-in” powers in relation to a specified type of banking group company.
Part 3 amends secondary legislation upon which the UK relies for compliance with its obligations in relation to the BRRD. It adds to the definition of “group resolution plan”, and makes further provision concerning resolution plans, the assessment of resolvability of groups, and the removal of impediments to resolvability of institutions and groups. Regulations 45 to 55 relate to the MREL, including omitting provision restricting the manner in which it is to be expressed, and regulations 56 and 57 add provision relating to Union parent undertakings into the provisions about cross-border group resolution.
Part 4 makes provision in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) (“EUWA”) to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. In particular, these Regulations address deficiencies under paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (g) of section 8(2) and transfer functions under section 8(6) of EUWA. The deficiencies are those which are introduced by the implementation of Directive 2019/879.
Part 5 (which is made under the European Communities Act 1972) is to cease to have effect on IP completion day. It makes various provision related to resolution, conferring powers on the Bank to prohibit distributions in particular circumstances, modifying conditions for the exercise of certain stabilisation powers, imposing requirements to include certain contractual terms in contracts, and making amendments to the ranking of debts in insolvency.

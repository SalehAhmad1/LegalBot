DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This instrument amends the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligations Order 2007 (S.I. 2007/3072, “the RTFO Order”). It amends a step of the calculation used to determine the amount a supplier must pay to discharge any shortfall in their renewable transport fuel obligation in accordance with article 21 of the RTFO Order. The amendment increases the multiplier that will be applied to any shortfall in a supplier’s main renewable transport fuel obligation (as defined in article 4(6) of the RTFO Order) from £0.30 to £0.50 for obligation periods beginning on or after 1st January 2021. This instrument also makes a consequential amendment to article 23 (civil penalties) of the RTFO Order to ensure the amount of any civil penalty payable in accordance with that article is unchanged.

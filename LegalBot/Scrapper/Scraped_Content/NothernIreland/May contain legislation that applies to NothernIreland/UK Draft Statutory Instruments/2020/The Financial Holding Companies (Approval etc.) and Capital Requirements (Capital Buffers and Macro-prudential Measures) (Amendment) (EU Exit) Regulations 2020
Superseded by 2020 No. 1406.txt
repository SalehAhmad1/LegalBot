O-SII Buffers
CHAPTER 1
Interpretation and power to impose O-SII buffer
Interpretation
34.—(1) For the purposes of this Part, a relevant O-SII is an O-SII, or part of an O-SII, which is—
(a)
a ring-fenced body within the meaning of section 142A of FSMA(1);
(b)
a large building society; or
(c)
a financial holding company or a mixed financial holding company which—
(i)
has a ring-fenced body or a large building society as a subsidiary; and
(ii)
is required, whether by the PRA by a direction under section 192C of FSMA or otherwise, to comply with the requirements of the capital requirements regulation and Directive 2013/36/EU UK law on a sub-consolidated basis.
(2) In paragraph (1)(b) “large building society” means a building society where the sum total of the following two values exceeds £25 billion—
(a)
the value of shares issued by the building society that are not deferred shares; and
(b)
the value of deposits held in accounts with the building society where one or more of the account holders is a small business.
(3) In paragraph (1)(c), “Directive 2013/36/EU UK law”, “financial holding company” and “mixed financial holding company” have the meanings given in section 192O of FSMA.
(4) In paragraph (2)—
(a)
“building society”, “deferred shares”, “deposit” and “share” have the meaning given by section 119 (interpretation) of the Building Societies Act 1986(2);
(b)
a person is a small business only if the person is a small business for the purposes of section 7(10) (the funding limit)(3) of the Building Societies Act 1986.
(4) For the purposes of this Part—
“buffer rate” has the meaning given in regulation 34ZA(2);
“FPC framework” has the meaning given in regulation 34ZB(1);
“O-SII buffer” has the meaning given in regulation 34ZA(1).
Power for the PRA to require an O-SII buffer to be maintained
34ZA.—(1) The PRA may require a relevant O-SII to maintain Common Equity Tier 1 capital, to be known as an “O-SII buffer”.
(2) The amount of capital which the PRA may require a relevant O-SII to hold (“the buffer rate”) must be expressed as a percentage of the relevant O-SII’s total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of the capital requirements regulation.
CHAPTER 2
United Kingdom buffer rates for O-SIIs
O-SII buffer rates: The FPC framework
34ZB.—(1) The FPC must have a framework for O-SII buffer rates in the United Kingdom established in accordance with this regulation (“the FPC framework”).
(2) The FPC framework must contain the following elements—
(a)
a set of criteria for assessing the extent to which the failure or distress of a relevant O-SII might pose a risk to the financial system;
(b)
a methodology for measuring the criteria and giving a relevant O-SII a single score in relation to the criteria; and
(c)
in relation to each score that an O-SII may receive, a buffer rate that corresponds to the score.
(3) In paragraph (2)(a), a relevant O-SII is in distress only if it experiences a significant deterioration in its financial situation.
(4) In paragraph (2)(a) the criteria to be specified must each be—
(a)
measurable; and
(b)
capable of being applied to a relevant O-SII on an individual basis, a sub-consolidated basis and a consolidated basis.
(5) In paragraph (2)(c) the only buffer rates that the FPC may specify are 0%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5% and 3%.
(6) The way in which buffer rates correspond to scores in the FPC framework—
(a)
must be clear, precise and unambiguous;
(b)
must ensure that a score corresponds to one buffer rate only;
(c)
may not be expressed in terms of a discretion conferred on a person or body (including the FPC); and
may be expressed by way of a formula, an algorithm, a graph or a table.
(7) The Bank must publish each element of the FPC framework, together with the FPC’s justification for each element.
Determination by PRA of buffer rates for individual relevant O-SIIs
34ZC.—(1) The PRA may, in relation to each relevant O-SII, determine—
(a)
whether or not to set a buffer rate for the O-SII; and
(b)
where it does set a buffer rate, subject to paragraph (3), the level of the rate;
by applying the steps set out in paragraph (2).
(2) The steps set out in this paragraph are—
Step 1—determining level of consolidation
The PRA must choose one of the following bases on which to apply the criteria specified in the FPC framework to the relevant O-SII—
(a)
an individual basis;
(b)
a sub-consolidated basis; or
(c)
a consolidated basis.
Step 2—deriving a framework buffer rate from the FPC framework
The PRA must derive a buffer rate from the FPC framework for the relevant O-SII (“a framework buffer rate”) by—
(a)
applying the methodology of the FPC framework to obtain a score for the relevant O-SII; and
(b)
ascertaining to what buffer rate the score corresponds under the FPC framework.
Step 3—setting a buffer rate for a relevant O-SII based on supervisory judgment
The PRA may, if it makes a sound supervisory judgment that it is appropriate to do so—
(a)
set a buffer rate for a relevant O-SII, even if it has derived a framework buffer rate for the institution of 0% under Step 2;
(b)
set a buffer rate for a relevant O-SII which is different to the framework buffer rate derived for the institution under Step 2; or
(c)
set no buffer rate for a relevant O-SII, even if it has derived a framework buffer rate for the institution of other than 0% under Step 2.
Where the PRA sets a buffer rate under sub-paragraph (a) or (b) of this Step the rate must be 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5% or 3%.
Step 4—setting a buffer rate for relevant O-SIIs based on framework buffer rate
Unless the PRA exercises the discretion in Step 3—
(a)
where the PRA derives a framework buffer rate under Step 2 of 0% for the relevant O-SII, the PRA may not set a buffer rate for the institution; and
(b)
where the PRA derives a framework buffer rate under Step 2 other than 0% for the relevant O-SII, the PRA must set the rate so derived as the buffer rate for the institution.
(3) Where paragraph (4) applies, the PRA may not apply an O-SII buffer rate to a relevant O-SII which exceeds the lower of—
(a)
the sum of—
(i)
the higher of the G-SII or the O-SII buffer rate applicable to the group at consolidated level, and
(ii)
1% of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of the capital requirements regulation; and
(b)
3% of the total risk exposure amount calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of the capital requirements regulation.
(4) This paragraph applies where the relevant O-SII is a subsidiary of—
(a)
a G-SII; or
(b)
an O-SII, which is subject to an O-SII buffer on a consolidated basis.
(5) Where a group is subject on a consolidated basis to both a G-SII buffer and an O-SII buffer, only the higher buffer is to apply.
CHAPTER 3
Date of application and calculation of O-SII buffer
Date of application
34ZD.—(1) Where the PRA sets a buffer rate for a relevant O-SII under regulation 34ZC, the PRA must decide the date from which the O-SII must apply that rate in the calculation of its O-SII buffer.
(2) Where the PRA has set a buffer rate for a relevant O-SII under regulation 34ZC and determines that a buffer rate is no longer to be set for the O-SII under that regulation, the PRA must decide the date from which this takes effect.
Calculation of buffer
34ZE.—(1) The PRA must require a relevant O-SII to calculate its O-SII buffer by applying the buffer rate set for it under regulation 34ZC to all its exposures.
(2) The PRA must require the relevant O-SII, for the purposes of the calculation required under paragraph (1), to—
(a)
determine the value of its exposures by applying the level of consolidation selected by the PRA under Step 1 of regulation 34ZC(2); and
(b)
apply the buffer rate equally to all exposures, regardless of where they are located.
CHAPTER 4
Publication, Review and Appeals
Publication: United Kingdom buffer rates
34ZF.—(1) Where the PRA sets a buffer rate for a relevant O-SII under regulation 34ZC, the PRA must publish the following information—
(a)
the relevant O-SII to which the buffer rate applies;
(b)
the buffer rate;
(c)
the justification for setting the buffer rate;
(d)
the date from which the relevant O-SII must apply the buffer rate;
(e)
the level of consolidation to be used in the calculation of the O-SII buffer (as determined under Step 1 of regulation 34ZC(2)); and
(f)
the fact that the O-SII buffer applies to exposures located anywhere in the world.
(2) Where the PRA determines that a buffer rate is no longer to be set for a relevant O-SII under regulation 34ZC, the PRA must publish the following information—
(a)
the fact that the buffer rate is no longer set;
(b)
the fact that the relevant O-SII is no longer required to maintain an O-SII buffer;
(c)
the justification for ceasing to set the buffer rate; and
(d)
the date from which the relevant O-SII may cease to apply the buffer rate.
(3) A reference to the PRA’s justification in paragraphs (1)(c) and (2)(c) includes the PRA’s justification for doing anything under Step 3 of regulation 34ZC(2).
(4) The PRA must not publish information under paragraph (1)(c) or (2)(c) if publication might jeopardise the stability of the financial system.
Review
34ZG.—(1) The FPC must review the elements of the FPC framework at least every second year.
(2) The PRA must review the following matters at least once every year—
(a)

(b)
in relation to a country other than the United Kingdom which is not an EEA state, a buffer rate set by the relevant authority of that country, that the PRA considers serves a similar purpose to the buffer rates that may be set in accordance with Article 133 of the capital requirements directive as it has effect in EU law as amended from time to time, or if revoked, by its successor.
(2) The PRA may decide to recognise a third country buffer rate (“a recognition decision”).
(3) A recognition decision may relate to all institutions or institutions of a specified description.
(4) The PRA may revoke a recognition decision.
Requirement to maintain a systemic risk buffer
34C.—(1) The PRA may require an institution, a UK parent financial holding company, or a UK parent mixed financial holding company (a “relevant entity”) to hold additional Common Equity Tier 1 capital (“a systemic risk buffer”) in relation to some or all of the exposures referred to in regulation 34G, in order to prevent or mitigate macro-prudential or systemic risks which are not covered—
(a)
under the capital requirements regulation; or
(b)
by the countercyclical capital buffer, the G-SII buffer or the O-SII buffer provided for in these Regulations.
(2) If the PRA imposes a requirement on a relevant entity under paragraph (1), the PRA must specify—

the exposures or subset of exposures to which that requirement relates;
(b)
the buffer rate to be applied to those exposures.
(3) The only buffer rates that the PRA may specify for the purposes of paragraph (2) are 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5% and 5%.
(4) For the purposes of this regulation, a risk is a “macro-prudential or systemic risk” if it is a risk of disruption in the financial system with the potential to have serious negative consequences to the financial system and the real economy in the United Kingdom.
(5) The PRA may impose a requirement under paragraph (1) on all relevant entities, or on relevant entities of a specified description, and may impose different requirements in relation to different relevant entities or classes of exposures.
Third country rates: application to relevant entities
34D.—(1) The PRA may require a relevant entity which has exposures located in a third country, in relation to which a recognition decision is in effect, to apply the third country buffer rate, in relation to its total exposures in that country.
(2) The powers in paragraph (1), in relation to a recognition decision which is limited to relevant entities of a specified description (in accordance with regulation 34B(3)), apply only to relevant entities falling within the description.
(3) Where a relevant entity is required to apply a third country buffer rate under paragraph (1), the PRA must specify, to the relevant entity concerned, the basis to be applied in valuing exposures from one of the following bases—
(a)
an individual basis;
(b)
a sub-consolidated basis; or
(c)
a consolidated basis.
(4) Where the PRA require a relevant entity to apply a third country buffer rate under paragraph (1)—
(a)
if the third country buffer rate addresses different risks to the systemic risk buffer rate applied under regulation 34C (the “regulation 34C rate”), the third country buffer rate may be applied cumulatively with the systemic risk buffer rate;
(b)
if the third country buffer rate addresses the same risks as the regulation 34C rate, only the higher buffer rate is to be applied.
(6) The PRA may revoke a requirement imposed under paragraph (1).
(7) Where the PRA decides that a relevant entity must apply a third country buffer rate, the regulator must decide the date from which the relevant entity must apply the third country buffer rate.
(8) Where the PRA revokes a requirement that a relevant entity maintain a third country buffer, the regulator must decide the date from which the relevant entity must cease to apply the third country buffer rate.
Calculation of the systemic risk buffer
34E.—(1) Relevant entities must calculate the amount of the systemic risk buffer in accordance with the following formula—
where—
“SRB” is the systemic risk buffer;
“RT” is the buffer rate applicable to the amount of the total risk exposure of a relevant entity;
“ET” is the amount of the total risk exposure of the relevant entity calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of the capital requirements regulation;
“I” is the index denoting the subset of exposures specified by the PRA under regulation 34C(2);
“RI” is the buffer rate applicable to the amount of the risk exposure of I;
“EI” is the risk exposure amount of a relevant entity for I calculated in accordance with Article 92(3) of the capital requirements regulation.
(2) The PRA may require a relevant entity to maintain a systemic risk buffer on—
(a)
an individual basis;
(b)
a sub-consolidated basis; or
(c)
a consolidated basis.
Cumulative buffers
34F.—(1) Where a relevant entity is subject to a systemic risk buffer, applied in accordance with this Part, subject to paragraph (2), that buffer is to be cumulative with the O-SII buffer applied under Part 5ZA or the G-SII buffer set under Part 4.
(2) The sum of the systemic risk buffer rate and the O-SII buffer rate or G-SII buffer rate may not exceed 5%.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement, in part, Directive (EU) 2019/878 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 (“CRDV”), amending Directive 2013/36/EU as regards exempted entities, financial holding companies, mixed financial holding companies, remuneration, supervisory measures and powers and capital conservation measures (O.J. L150, 7.6.2019, p.253). Part 2 provides power for the PRA to remove a person from the board of directors of an institution or financial holding company or mixed financial holding company where the person concerned no longer satisfies the requirements for such directors, and inserts a new Part 12B into the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (c. 8) introducing a requirement for certain financial holding companies and mixed financial holding companies to be approved.
Part 3 amends the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Disclosure of Confidential Information) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/2188) to permit the PRA to disclose information to certain international bodies as required by Article 1(14) of CRDV, which introduced a new Article 58a into Directive 2013/36/EU.
Part 4 amends the Capital Requirements (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018, exercising powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) (“the 2018 Act”) as well as section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c. 68). They ensure that the amendments made by those Regulations to the Capital Requirements (Capital Buffers and Macro-prudential Measures) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/894) properly reflect the amendments required to implement CRDV, providing for a new capital buffer for certain other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs), and amending the provisions relating to the capital conservation buffer, institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer, and the systemic risk buffer. They also address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (and in particular the deficiencies under paragraphs (b), (c), (e), (f) and (g) of section 8(2) of the 2018 Act).
An impact assessment has not been produced, as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

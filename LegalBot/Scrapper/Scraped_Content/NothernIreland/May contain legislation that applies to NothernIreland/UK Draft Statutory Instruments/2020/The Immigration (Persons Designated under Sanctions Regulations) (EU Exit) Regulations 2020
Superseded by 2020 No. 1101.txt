These Regulations make provision in relation to immigration sanctions made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018.

Regulations 6 to 8 ensure that the process of consideration of a human rights or protection claim by a person subject to a sanction is kept distinct from the review and challenge mechanisms for the sanction itself.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

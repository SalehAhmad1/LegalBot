DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulations 1 to 85 of these Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in sections 8(1) and 23(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16), in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to the legislative framework for unmanned aircraft. The majority of the amendments concern two EU Regulations. Regulations 2 to 58 amend Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/945 (on unmanned aircraft systems and on third-country operators of unmanned aircraft systems). Regulations 59 to 84 amend Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/947 (on the rules and procedures for the operation of unmanned aircraft).
Regulation 85 makes minor amendments to the Air Navigation Order 2016 (S.I. 2016/765) to remove references to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).
Regulation 86 makes consequential provision in exercise of the power in section 41(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1). It replaces references to “exit day” in regulation 10 of the Operation of Air Services (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 with references to “IP completion day”.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as no, or no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on the UK legislation website at Lwww.legislation.gov.uk.

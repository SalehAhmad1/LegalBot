(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 to and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU legislation to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (c), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Part 2 of these Regulations make amendments to Regulation (EU) 2017/625 and Part 3 amends EU tertiary legislation. These instruments concern official controls to be carried out on entry of animals and goods into Great Britain, from countries outside the British Islands. They also cover requirements relating to transit of animals and good through Great Britain. They provide for various functions of the European Commission, including making instruments of a legislative character, to be exercisable instead by the “appropriate authority” and for other functions to be exercised by the “competent authority”. Both of these terms are defined in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625.
Part 4 makes amendments to the EEA Agreement.
Part 5 makes consequential amendments to existing EU Exit statutory instruments and Part 6 makes consequential revocations and transitional and saving provision.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

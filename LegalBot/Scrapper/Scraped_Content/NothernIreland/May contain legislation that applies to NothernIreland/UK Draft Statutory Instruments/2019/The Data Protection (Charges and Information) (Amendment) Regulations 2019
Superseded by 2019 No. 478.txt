DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/480) set out the circumstances in which data controllers are required to pay a charge to the Information Commissioner. Regulation 2 of those Regulations requires a data controller to pay an annual charge to the Information Commissioner unless all the processing of personal data by the data controller is exempt processing. “Exempt processing” has the meaning given in the Schedule to those Regulations.
These Regulations amend the Schedule to the Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018 so that processing of personal data by members of the House of Lords, elected representatives and prospective representatives is also “exempt processing” for the purposes of those Regulations.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

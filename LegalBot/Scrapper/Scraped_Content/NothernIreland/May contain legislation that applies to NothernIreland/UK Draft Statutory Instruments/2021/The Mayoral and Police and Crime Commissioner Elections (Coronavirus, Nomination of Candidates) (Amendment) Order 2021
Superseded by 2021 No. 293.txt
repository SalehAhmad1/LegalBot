DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends Schedules 1 and 3 to the Local Authorities (Mayoral Elections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/1024), Schedule 3 to the Police and Crime Commissioner Elections Order 2012 (S.I. 2012/1917) and Schedules 1 and 3 to the Combined Authorities (Mayoral Elections) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/67). It reduces the number of subscribing electors that are required on a candidate nomination form for Police and Crime Commissioner, Combined Authority Mayoral and Local Authority Mayoral elections. This is to reduce the amount of person to person contact that may be needed as part of the nomination process, in order to reduce the risk of exposure to and transmission of the Coronavirus.
Article 2 provides for the expiry of these amendments at the end of 28th February 2022, except in respect of elections which have been commenced (by the issuing of the notice of election) on or before but not concluded on that date.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on business, charities or the public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Part 2 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) makes provision for the proscription of organisations (including setting out offences in relation to proscribed organisations in sections 11 to 13). An organisation is proscribed if it is listed in Schedule 2 to the Act or, in most cases, it operates under the same name as an organisation so listed (section 3(1)).
Paragraph 2 of Article 2 substitutes the name of an entire organisation – commonly known as Hamas – for the name of the part of that organisation previously listed, so that the organisation is proscribed in its entirety.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this Order as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers’ Compensation) Act 1979 (c. 41) (“the Act”) lump sum payments may be made to certain persons disabled by a disease to which the Act applies, or to dependants of persons who were so disabled before they died. The diseases to which the Act applies are pneumoconiosis, byssinosis, diffuse mesothelioma, primary carcinoma of the lung (where accompanied by asbestosis or diffuse pleural thickening) and diffuse pleural thickening.
These Regulations amend the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers’ Compensation) (Payment of Claims) Regulations 1988 (S.I. 1988/668) (“the 1988 Regulations”). The amendments made by regulation 2 have the effect of increasing the amounts payable under the 1988 Regulations. The increase in each case is 0.5 per cent rounded up or down to the nearest £1 as appropriate.
By virtue of regulation 1(2), the amendments made by these Regulations apply only in relation to any case in which a person first fulfils the conditions of entitlement to a payment under the Act on or after 1st April 2021.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

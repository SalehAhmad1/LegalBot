DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies, arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of criminal justice, and in particular amend legislation relating to the Country of Origin principle for electronic commerce as established by Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market. Part 2 amends primary legislation and Part 3 amends subordinate legislation.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

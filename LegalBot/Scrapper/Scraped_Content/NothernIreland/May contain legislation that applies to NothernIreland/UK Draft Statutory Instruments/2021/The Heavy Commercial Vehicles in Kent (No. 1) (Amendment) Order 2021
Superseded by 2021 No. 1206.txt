DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 1) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/1388) (the “2019 Order”) and the Road Safety (Financial Penalty Deposit) (Appropriate Amount) Order 2009 (S.I. 2009/492) (the “2009 Order”).
Article 2 removes article 2(9) of the 2019 Order which provided that the powers conferred on traffic officers by the 2019 Order would cease to have effect at the end of 31st October 2021. The powers therefore continue in force beyond that date.
Article 3 omits several offences from the 2009 Order to reflect amendments being made by related instruments to the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 2) Order 2019(1) (S.I. 2019/1394) and the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 3) Order 2019(2) (S.I. 2019/1210).
A full Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it is not expected to have a significant impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors. An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared for this Order and is available alongside this instrument on the UK Legislation website www.legislation.gov.uk.

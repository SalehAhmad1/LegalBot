(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into operation on 28th June 2021 a revised code of practice made under section 292 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (c. 29) (“the 2002 Act”) in connection with the exercise of the powers conferred by virtue of section 289 of the 2002 Act. Revisions to the code of practice are necessitated by the commencement in Northern Ireland of amendments made to the 2002 Act by the Criminal Finances Act 2017 (c. 22).
Section 289 of the 2002 Act permits officers of Revenue and Customs, constables, SFO officers and accredited financial investigators to search persons, vehicles and premises for cash which is derived from, or intended for use in, unlawful conduct.
By virtue of section 24 of the UK Borders Act 2007 (c. 30), Chapter 3 of Part 5 of the 2002 Act (which includes both sections 289 and 292) applies to an immigration officer as it applies in relation to a constable, subject to modifications made by that section. Immigration officers may thereby exercise the powers in section 289 of the 2002 Act in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The revised code of practice brought into operation by this Order relates to the exercise of the powers conferred by virtue of section 289 of the 2002 Act, and by virtue of section 24 of the UK Borders Act 2007, respectively, by: officers of Revenue and Customs in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; constables in England and Wales; SFO officers in England and Wales and Northern Ireland; accredited financial investigators in England and Wales; and immigration officers in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Separate codes of practice are made by the Scottish Ministers in connection with the exercise of powers conferred by virtue of section 289 on constables in Scotland, and by the Department of Justice of Northern Ireland in connection with the exercise of powers conferred by virtue of section 289 on constables and accredited financial investigators in Northern Ireland.
The revised code of practice brought into operation by this Order replaces the code of practice that was brought into operation by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cash Searches: Code of Practice) Order 2018 (S.I. 2018/83). This Order revokes S.I. 2018/83.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

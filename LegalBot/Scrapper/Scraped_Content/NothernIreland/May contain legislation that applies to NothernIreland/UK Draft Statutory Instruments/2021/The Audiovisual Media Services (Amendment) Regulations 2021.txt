DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular, deficiencies falling within subsection (2)(a), (c), (d) and (g) of section 8) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulations 5, 6 and 13 amend the requirements for OFCOM to maintain up to date lists of providers of audiovisual media services (i.e. linear television services, on-demand programme services and video-sharing platform services) in the United Kingdom, so that the lists and updates to them no longer have to be notified to the European Commission. Instead OFCOM must publish the lists on their website.
Regulations 11 and 18 replace duties on OFCOM to co-operate with EEA States and the European Commission with a power for OFCOM to co-operate with EEA States subject to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, and with their national regulatory authorities, for certain purposes.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

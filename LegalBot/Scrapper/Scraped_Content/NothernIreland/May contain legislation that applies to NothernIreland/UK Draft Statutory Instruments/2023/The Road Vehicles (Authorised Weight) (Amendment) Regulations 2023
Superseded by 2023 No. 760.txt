DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Road Vehicles (Authorised Weight) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/3111) (the “1998 Regulations”) by making provision to increase the maximum authorised weights in domestic traffic for certain alternatively fuelled vehicles and certain zero emission vehicles, to support their uptake as part of the move to a net-zero target. Provision already exists to permit similar increases in international traffic.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 2 of the 1998 Regulations to add a definition of “zero-emission vehicle” for the purposes of these Regulations. Definitions and some provisions relevant to alternatively fuelled vehicles had already been inserted into the 1998 Regulations by the Road Vehicles (Authorised Weight) and (Construction and Use) (Amendment) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/881).
Regulation 4 amends regulation 4 of the 1998 Regulations to replace reference to “maximum permitted gross or train weight” with “maximum permitted gross weight”, and to increase the maximum authorised weights for—
(a)
relevant alternatively fuelled vehicle combinations: with the increase equivalent to the additional weight of the particular alternative fuel power train in excess of a comparable fossil fuel vehicle’s power train, to a maximum of an additional one tonne; and
(b)
relevant zero-emission vehicles and relevant zero-emission vehicle combinations: with the increase of an additional two tonnes in all instances.
Regulation 5 amends Schedule 1 to the 1998 Regulations to increase the maximum authorised weight of a relevant zero-emission vehicle when the relevant requirements are fulfilled.
Regulation 6 amends Schedule 2 to the 1998 Regulations to increase the maximum authorised weight of a relevant alternatively fuelled vehicle combination or a relevant zero-emission vehicle combination when the relevant requirements are fulfilled.
Regulation 7 provides for the Secretary of State to undertake a review of the regulatory provision contained in these Regulations on a five yearly basis.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum and a De Minimis Assessment have been produced for this instrument and have been published alongside these Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

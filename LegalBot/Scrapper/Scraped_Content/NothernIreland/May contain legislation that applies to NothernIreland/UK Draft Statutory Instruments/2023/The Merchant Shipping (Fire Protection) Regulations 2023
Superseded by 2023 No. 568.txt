These Regulations implement amendments to Chapter II-2 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (“the Convention”) relating to fire protection, fire detection and fire extinction, and also make provision in respect of ships to which the Convention does not apply. The Regulations revoke and replace the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection: Large Ships) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/1012), the Merchant Shipping (Fire Protection) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/2950) and the provisions that amend both sets of Regulations.
The Regulations contain requirements relating to a ship’s structural fire protection and apply to ships that may be on international or non-international voyages. They deal separately with ships constructed before 1st July 2002 (Part 2), ships constructed between 1st July 2002 and before 1st July 2012 engaged on international voyages (Part 3), ships constructed on or after 1st July 2002 and engaged on non-international voyages (Part 4), ships constructed on or after 1st July 2012 engaged on international voyages (Part 5) and ships of Classes XI and XII (Part 6).
The Regulations apply, with certain limited exceptions, to United Kingdom ships and to non-United Kingdom ships in United Kingdom waters, including ships from countries which are not parties to the Convention. They apply to passenger ships of Classes I, II and II(A), and to non-passenger ships of Classes VII, VII(A), VII(T), VIII, VIII(A), VIII(T), VIII(A)(T), IX, IX(A), IX(A)(T), XI and XII. These classes of ship are defined in Schedule 2.
The Regulations implement all amendments to Chapter II-2 as at the date on which this instrument comes into force.

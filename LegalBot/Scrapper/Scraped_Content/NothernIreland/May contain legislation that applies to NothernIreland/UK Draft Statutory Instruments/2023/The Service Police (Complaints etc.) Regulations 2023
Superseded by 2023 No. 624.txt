See section 375(1A) of the 2006 Act for the meaning of “tri-service serious crime unit”.Complaints, matters and persons to which this Part applies
9.—(1) In these Regulations, references to a complaint are references (subject to the following provisions of this regulation) to any expression of dissatisfaction with a service police force or the tri-service serious crime unit which is expressed (whether in writing or otherwise) by or on behalf of any person.
(2) But an expression of dissatisfaction is only a complaint for the purposes of these Regulations—
(a)
where the expression of dissatisfaction relates to conduct of a member of a service police force, if the person is a person falling within paragraph (3);
(b)
in any other case, if the person has been adversely affected by the matter about which dissatisfaction is expressed.

(4) In these Regulations, “conduct matter” means (subject to the following provisions of this regulation) any matter which is not and has not been the subject of a complaint but in the case of which there is an indication (whether from the circumstances or otherwise) that a member of a service police force may have—

committed a service offence; or
(b)
behaved in a manner that would justify the initiation of administrative action procedures.
(5) The complaints that are complaints for the purposes of these Regulations by virtue of paragraph (3)(b) do not, except in a case falling within paragraph (6), include any complaint where the person expressing dissatisfaction or the person on whose behalf dissatisfaction is being expressed, claims to have been adversely affected as a consequence only of having seen or heard the conduct, or any of the alleged effects of the conduct.
(6) A case falls within this paragraph if —
(a)
it was only because the person expressing dissatisfaction or the person on whose behalf dissatisfaction is being expressed was physically present, or sufficiently nearby, when the conduct took place or the effects occurred that the person was able to see or hear the conduct or its effects; or
(b)
the adverse effect is attributable to, or was aggravated by, the fact that the person in relation to whom the conduct took place was already known to the person claiming to have suffered the adverse effect.
(7) For the purposes of this regulation, a person is taken to have witnessed conduct if, and only if—
(a)
that person acquired knowledge of that conduct in a manner which would make that person a competent witness capable of giving admissible evidence of that conduct in proceedings before a Court Martial; or
(b)
that person has in their possession or under their control anything which would in any such proceedings constitute admissible evidence of that conduct.
(8) For the purposes of this Part, a person is not to be taken to have authorised another person to make a complaint on that person’s behalf unless—

that other person is for the time being designated for the purposes of this Part by the Commissioner as a person through whom complaints may be made, or that other person is of a description of persons so designated; or
(b)

to the person by whom the complaint or purported complaint was made; or
(b)
in a case where the complaint or purported complaint was made on behalf of someone else, to the person on whose behalf it was made;
but where any person is acting on another’s behalf for the purposes of any complaint or purported complaint, anything that is to be or may be done under this Part or in relation to the complainant may be done instead by or in relation to the person acting on the complainant’s behalf.
(10) In relation to any conduct or to anything purporting to be a complaint about any conduct, references to a person in this Part do not include—
(a)
a person who, at the time when the conduct is supposed to have taken place, was under the direction of the same Provost Marshal as the person whose conduct is in question; or
(b)
a person who was on duty in their capacity as a member of a service police force—

at the time when the conduct is supposed to have taken place in relation to that person; or

at the time when that person is supposed to have been adversely affected by it or to have witnessed it.

(a)
who is a member of the service police force with which dissatisfaction is expressed; or
(b)
where the dissatisfaction is expressed in relation to the tri-service serious crime unit, was a member of the tri-service serious crime unit at the time the matter the complaint relates to occurred.

(13) References in this Part to the investigation of any complaint or matter by the appropriate authority on its own behalf, under the direction of the Commissioner or by the Commissioner, are to be construed as references to its investigation in accordance with regulation 33, 34 or 36 as the case may be.

(a)
in or in consequence of which a person has died or has sustained serious injury; and

in relation to which the requirements of paragraph (15) or (16) are satisfied.

was otherwise detained in the custody of a member of a service police force.

(b)
there is an indication that the contact may have caused (whether directly or indirectly) or contributed to the death or serious injury.
(17) In paragraph (14) the reference to a person includes a member of a service police force, but in relation to such a person “contact” in paragraph (16) does not include contact that person has whilst acting in the execution of their duties as a member of such a force.Complaints and conduct matters relating to the conduct of former members of a service police force

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide the statutory framework and detailed rules in accordance with which the Service Police Complaints Commissioner (“the Commissioner”), established under section 365BA of the Armed Forces Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”), has oversight of service police conduct and of complaints and other matters relating to the conduct of a member of each service police force including the four Provost Marshals. They broadly correspond to the provisions set out in and made under Part 2 of, and Schedule 3 to, the Police Reform Act 2002 (“the 2002 Act”) that apply to persons serving with the police in England and Wales, with modifications where necessary to reflect differences between the service police and the territorial police.
These Regulations also provide the basis for super-complaints that relate to the service police to be made to the Chief Inspector of Constabulary by a designated body. They broadly correspond to the provisions set out in and made under Part 2A of the 2002 Act.
Part 1 contains introductory provision (regulation 1) and an interpretation provision (regulation 2); this includes a definition of the “appropriate authority”, which performs a number of investigative functions under the framework established by these Regulations.
Part 2 sets out the general functions and duties of the Commissioner (regulations 3, 5 and 6) and makes provision for co-operation between the Commissioner and the Chief Inspector of Constabulary (“the Chief Inspector”) (regulation 4). It also sets out reporting requirements (regulation 7).
Part 3 sets out the procedure for handling complaints, conduct matters, and death and serious injury matters (“DSI matters”).
Chapter 1 sets out some general matters regarding application.
Chapter 2 sets out provisions for the handling of complaints; these relate to the duties on the appropriate authority to preserve evidence relating to complaints (regulation 11), handling and recording of complaints (regulations 12, 15 and 17), referring a complaint to the Commissioner (regulation 13) and imposes duties on the Commissioner when a complaint is so referred (regulation 16). Regulation 18 sets out provisions for a review of a complaint which has not been investigated.
Chapter 3 is concerned with the handling of conduct matters that come to an appropriate authority’s attention either as a result of proposed or actual civil proceedings or otherwise (regulations 21 and 22). This Chapter imposes further duties on the Commissioner in relation to handling of conduct matters.
Chapter 4 contains provisions relating to the handling of DSI matters and sets out the duty to record DSI matters (regulation 27) and preserve evidence (regulation 28). It also imposes duties on the Commissioner when a DSI matter is referred to the Commissioner.
Chapter 5 sets out the framework for investigations and subsequent proceedings, including the basis on which the Commissioner determines the form of an investigation in a matter referred to the Commissioner (regulation 32). This Chapter contains provisions relating to investigations by the appropriate authority on its own behalf (regulation 33) or directed by the Commissioner (regulation 34) or by investigators appointed by the Commissioner (regulation 36). Schedule 1 makes further provision in relation to investigatory powers for investigators appointed by the Commissioner. Schedule 2 makes consequential amendments.
Part 4 contains provision in relation to the making of super-complaints to the Chief Inspector by a designated body.
Chapter 1 provides for bodies designated by the Secretary of State to make super-complaints to the Chief Inspector about the service police forces and tri-service serious crime unit, and sets out the criteria that must be applied by the Secretary of State in deciding whether to designate a body and whether to revoke such a designation. It also provides for the Chief Inspector to issue guidance in relation to the making of super-complaints and sets out certain formal requirements for the making of such complaints (regulations 88 to 93).
Chapter 2 sets out certain duties that apply where a super-complaint has been made (regulations 94 to 97).
Chapter 3 sets out other matters relating to the investigation of super-complaints (powers to investigate and information sharing).
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

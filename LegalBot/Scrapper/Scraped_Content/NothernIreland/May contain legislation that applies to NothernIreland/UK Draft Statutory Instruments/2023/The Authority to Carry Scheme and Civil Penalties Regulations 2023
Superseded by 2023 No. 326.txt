(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force the Authority to Carry Scheme 2023 (“the Scheme”) which replaces the Authority to Carry Scheme 2021. The Scheme requires that a carrier must seek authority to carry persons on inbound or outbound journeys to and from the UK who come within the scope of the Scheme. The Scheme specifies the classes of carriers to which it applies, the passengers and crew in respect of whom authority must be requested and sets out the process for carriers to request authority to carry.
These Regulations make amendments to the Authority to Carry Scheme (Civil Penalties) Regulations 2015.
These Regulations revoke the Authority to Carry Scheme and Civil Penalties Regulations 2021. Transitional arrangements provide for the service of penalty notices for breaches of the Authority to Carry Scheme 2021.
The draft Scheme is published on the gov.uk website, with the final Scheme to be available in the same way.
The Scheme can be requested in hard copy from the Home Office by contacting predeparturechecks@homeoffice.gov.uk.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations require operators of most local bus and coach services to provide information to passengers about their journeys while they are on the vehicle. Although the Regulations come into force on 1st October 2023, they are subject to a phased introduction so that older vehicles are given longer to comply with the regulations than newer ones.
The information which must be provided to passengers is set out in regulations 7 to 11. In broad terms the information which must be provided is as follows:
information to identify the route and direction of travel (regulation 7);
information that the vehicle has reached its final stopping place (regulation 8);
information about stopping places on the route (regulation 9);
where a vehicle is on diversion, information about this (regulation 10); and
where a vehicle is being used on a hail and ride route, information to this effect (regulation 11).
Regulations 12 to 14 specify how information should be provided.
Regulation 12 requires information to be provided in audio and visual form. Regulation 13 sets out the requirements that apply to audio information (for example, how loud it should be). Regulation 14 sets out the requirements that apply to visual information (for example, the height of the text that should be used).
Regulation 15 requires the Secretary of State to review these Regulations at least once every five years.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. A de minimis impact assessment is available from the Department for Transport, 33 Horseferry Road, London, SW1P 4DR and is published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside this instrument at www.legislation.gov.uk.

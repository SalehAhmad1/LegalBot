(7) Where a supplier fails to make all or part of an additional reserve payment by the date it must be paid in accordance with paragraph (6), that supplier must pay the revenue collection counterparty simple interest on any unpaid amount at the rate specified in regulation 36(1) from the day after the date by which that amount should have been paid.
(8) For the purposes of—
(a)
paragraphs (3), (4) and (5), “the adjusted reference period” means the most recent period of 30 consecutive days in respect of which the BSCCo has carried out an Initial Volume Allocation Run;
(b)
paragraph (4), the amount of electricity supplied by an electricity supplier in a reference period or adjusted reference period is the amount of all electricity which the BSCCo determines was supplied by that supplier in that period, on the basis of the most recent BSC volume allocation run which the BSCCo has carried out.Determination of reduced total reserve amount
14.—(1) This regulation applies where the revenue collection counterparty is of the opinion that there is a high degree of likelihood that it will collect significantly more from suppliers under regulations 7(1) and 10(1) in respect of a quarterly obligation period than the amount it requires to be able to make all payments it is required to make during the reserve period which commences during that quarterly obligation period, taking into account any SoS funds that the Secretary of State has specified will be available in respect of that reserve period and that the Secretary of State has specified should be taken into account when adjusting the total reserve amount.
(2) Subject to paragraph (3), where this regulation applies the revenue collection counterparty may determine again the total reserve amount in respect of that quarterly obligation period in accordance with regulation 9(1)(a) and (6) (the “reduced total reserve amount”).
(3) The revenue collection counterparty may not make a determination under paragraph (2) after the date which is 5 working days before the date on which electricity suppliers must make a reserve payment under regulation 10(1).
(4) Where the revenue collection counterparty makes a determination under paragraph (2) in respect of a quarterly obligation period, it must—
(a)
publish a notice setting out its determination of the reduced total reserve amount for that period;
(b)
recalculate the amount (the “reduced reserve payment”) each supplier must pay under regulation 10(1) in respect of that period in accordance with regulation 10(3); and
(c)
issue a notice to each electricity supplier who was issued a notice under regulation 9(4) in respect of that period setting out the reduced reserve payment that supplier must pay under regulation 10(1) in respect of that period.
(5) The requirement to issue a notice under paragraph (4)(c) does not apply where a notice has been issued under regulation 15(3) in respect of the same obligation period.
(6) Where the revenue collection counterparty issues a notice to a supplier under paragraph (4)(c) and that supplier has already made a reserve payment in respect of the quarterly obligation period to which it relates which exceeds the reduced reserve payment due from that supplier, the revenue collection counterparty must pay back to that supplier the difference between the amount of that reserve payment and the reduced reserve payment now due from that supplier as soon as reasonably practicable.Reconciliation payments
15.—(1) The revenue collection counterparty must calculate, in accordance with regulation 16(1), the amounts to be paid as reconciliation payments by electricity suppliers or by that counterparty (“a reconciliation determination”) in respect of a quarterly obligation period (“the reconciliation period”)—
(a)
as soon as reasonably practicable after the revenue collection counterparty has issued a notice under regulation 7(4) in respect of the day which is the last day of the reconciliation period, and in any event before the conclusion of the quarterly obligation period which immediately follows the reconciliation period; and
(b)
once in every subsequent quarterly obligation period until the final reconciliation determination has been carried out in respect of the reconciliation period, as soon as reasonably practicable after the revenue collection counterparty has issued a notice under regulation 7(4) in respect of the last day of the quarterly obligation period which concluded immediately prior to that subsequent period, and in any event before the conclusion of that subsequent period.
(2) The final reconciliation determination in respect of the reconciliation period is the 10th reconciliation determination made in respect of that period.
(3) Where the revenue collection counterparty makes a reconciliation determination it must, as soon as reasonably practicable, issue a notice to each relevant supplier setting out—
(a)
the amount of any reconciliation payment which the revenue collection counterparty must make to that supplier following that determination; and
(b)
the amount of any reconciliation payment which that supplier must make to the revenue collection counterparty following that determination.
(4) For the purpose of paragraph (3), a “relevant supplier” is an electricity supplier who—
(a)
supplied electricity during the reconciliation period,
(b)
is due to make or receive a reconciliation payment, or
(c)
is due to make a reserve payment.Determination of reconciliation payments
16.—(1) The amount of a reconciliation payment to be paid to or by a supplier in respect of the reconciliation period is the revenue collection counterparty’s calculation, at the time of making that calculation, of the RCC period contribution in relation to that supplier in respect of the reconciliation period, less the net levied amount for that supplier in respect of that period.
(2) For the purposes of the calculation of a RCC period contribution, where a Final Reconciliation Volume Allocation Run or Post-Final Volume Allocation Run has not been carried out by the BSCCo in relation to a day in the reconciliation period, the amount of electricity supplied on that day by a supplier is to be determined on the basis of the most recent BSC volume allocation run which the BSCCo has carried out in relation to that day.
(3) Where the amount of a reconciliation payment in relation to an electricity supplier—
(a)
is a positive number, that supplier must pay that amount to the revenue collection counterparty;
(b)
is a negative number, the revenue collection counterparty must pay the absolute value of that amount to that supplier.
(4) Where, following a reconciliation determination, the revenue collection counterparty must make a reconciliation payment to an electricity supplier, or that electricity supplier must make a reconciliation payment to the revenue collection counterparty, that payment must be made by the 5th working day after the day on which the revenue collection counterparty has issued a notice to that supplier under regulation 15(3) in respect of that reconciliation determination.
(5) Where an electricity supplier is required to pay a reconciliation payment and it fails to pay all or part of that payment by the day on which that payment must be made, that supplier must pay the revenue collection counterparty simple interest on any unpaid amount at the rate specified in regulation 36(1) from the day after the day on which the payment should have been made.
(6) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the net levied amount for a supplier in respect of a reconciliation period is the amount of the supplier obligation amount less the counterparty obligation amount.
(7) For the purposes paragraph (6)—
“the supplier obligation amount” is the sum of the following amounts—
(a)
any payment that supplier was required to make under regulation 7(1) in respect of a day in the reconciliation period;
(b)
the sum of any payments that supplier was required to make under regulation 8(2) in respect of days in the reconciliation period;
(c)
any payment that supplier was required to make under regulation 10(1) in respect of the reconciliation period;
(d)
any payment that supplier was required to make under regulation 13(3) in respect of the reconciliation period; and
(e)
the sum of any reconciliation payments which that supplier was required to make under paragraph (3)(a) in respect of any previous reconciliation determination made in relation to the reconciliation period;
“the counterparty obligation amount” is the sum of the following amounts—
(a)
the sum of any payments the revenue collection counterparty was required to make under regulation 8(3) in respect of days in the reconciliation period; and
(b)
the sum of any reconciliation payments which the revenue collection counterparty was required to make under paragraph (3)(b) in respect of any previous reconciliation determination made in relation to the reconciliation period.Mutualisation
17.—(1) Where an electricity supplier (“the defaulting supplier”) fails to make a relevant payment the revenue collection counterparty may, subject to paragraph (5), require non-defaulting suppliers to pay a share of an amount equal to the amount which was not paid by issuing a notice (“a mutualisation notice”) to each non-defaulting supplier who supplied electricity during the reference period.
(2) For the purposes of this regulation a “non-defaulting supplier” in relation to a mutualisation notice means an electricity supplier who has—
(a)
not failed to make any relevant payment within the time limit for making the payment under these Regulations;
(b)
failed to make one or more relevant payments all of which have subsequently been paid to the revenue collection counterparty by the time the defaulting supplier was required to make the relevant payment referred to in paragraph (1); or
(c)
failed to make one or more relevant payments not all of which have subsequently been paid to the revenue collection counterparty by the time the defaulting supplier was required to make the relevant payment referred to in paragraph (1), but the revenue collection counterparty is of the opinion that it will hold some collateral provided by that supplier by the 5th working day after the day on which the revenue collection counterparty intends to issue that mutualisation notice.
(3) A mutualisation notice must state—
(a)
the amount which the defaulting supplier failed to pay;
(b)
the date by which the defaulting supplier should have paid that amount;
(c)
the amount (“the mutualisation amount”) which the non-defaulting supplier to whom the notice is issued must pay, calculated in accordance with paragraph (7);
(d)
the date (“the mutualisation date”) by which the mutualisation amount must be paid, which must be—
(i)

(ii)
in the case of a mutualisation notice issued in respect of any other relevant payment which the defaulting supplier was required to make, no earlier than 30 days after the date on which the notice was issued.
(4) A mutualisation date must be the same for each mutualisation notice issued in respect of a relevant payment which a defaulting supplier failed to pay.
(5) A mutualisation notice may only be issued where the revenue collection counterparty is of the opinion that it will not hold any collateral provided by the defaulting supplier by the 5th working day after the day on which the revenue collection counterparty intends to issue that notice.
(6) Where the revenue collection counterparty has issued a mutualisation notice to an electricity supplier, that supplier must pay the mutualisation amount specified in the notice by the date specified in the notice.
(7) Where an electricity supplier fails to pay all or part of a mutualisation payment in accordance with paragraph (6), that supplier must pay the revenue collection counterparty simple interest on any unpaid amount at the rate specified in regulation 36(1) from the day after the day on which the payment should have been made.
(8) The mutualisation amount to be stated in a mutualisation notice to be issued to a non-defaulting supplier is the amount given by—
where—
DA is the amount which the defaulting supplier failed to pay;
SRES is the amount of electricity supplied by the non-defaulting supplier in the reference period as determined immediately before the notice is issued;
EXE is the amount of EII excluded electricity supplied by the non-defaulting supplier in the reference period as determined immediately before the notice is issued;
NDPE is the total amount of electricity supplied by all non-defaulting suppliers in the reference period as determined immediately before the notice is issued; and
AXE is the total amount of EII excluded electricity supplied by all non-defaulting suppliers in the reference period as determined immediately before the notice is issued.

(a)
“collateral” is to be construed in accordance with regulation 19(7);
(b)
“relevant payment” means any payment which an electricity supplier is required to make by virtue of regulation 7(1), 8(2), 10(1), 13(3), 16(3)(a) or 17(6);
(c)
the reference period is the most recent period, occurring before the mutualisation notice (to which the reference period relates) has been issued, of 30 consecutive days in respect of which the BSCCo has carried out an Initial Volume Allocation Run; and
(d)
the amount of electricity supplied by an electricity supplier in a reference period is the amount of electricity which the BSCCo determines, on the basis of the most recent BSC volume allocation run which the BSCCo has carried out in relation to each day in that period, as the amount of electricity supplied by that supplier in that reference period.Repayment of mutualised amounts
18.—(1) Where the revenue collection counterparty has issued a mutualisation notice in respect of a failure of an electricity supplier (“the defaulting supplier”) to make a relevant payment (“the relevant default”) and subsequently recovers any amount from that supplier in respect of that failure, that amount must be paid to electricity suppliers who were required to pay mutualisation amounts in respect of that failure in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3).
(2) The amount which the revenue collection counterparty must, by virtue of paragraph (1), pay an electricity supplier who was required to pay a mutualisation amount (“the non-defaulting supplier”) is the amount given by—
where—
AR is the amount recovered from the defaulting supplier in respect of the relevant default, including any interest paid by the defaulting supplier in respect of that failure;
SU is the mutualisation amount which the non-defaulting supplier was required to pay in respect of the relevant default; and
AU is the total amount of mutualisation payments which were required to be paid by all non-defaulting suppliers in respect of the relevant default.
(3) Any amount which the revenue collection counterparty is required to pay by virtue of paragraph (1) must be paid by the 15th working day after the day on which it recovers the amount to be paid.
(4) In paragraph (1), “relevant payment” means any payment which an electricity supplier is required to make by virtue of regulation 7(1), 8(2), 10(1), 13(3), 16(3)(a) or 17(6).Requirement to provide collateral
19.—(1) This regulation applies at all times after an electricity supplier makes an electricity supply in a quarterly obligation period in respect of which it is required to make an interim rate payment.
(2) Where this regulation applies the supplier must ensure that, on any day, the revenue collection counterparty holds sufficient collateral from the supplier to meet the supplier’s collateral requirement for that day.
(3) The supplier’s collateral requirement for a day (“the relevant day”) is determined by reference to the most recent period of 21 consecutive days prior to the last working day before the relevant day, in respect of which the BSCCo had carried out a BSC volume allocation run (“the relevant period”).
(4) For each day in the relevant period, the amount of electricity supplied by the supplier on that day, less any amount of EII excluded electricity supplied by that supplier on that day, (both as determined on the last working day before the relevant day), multiplied by the interim levy rate which applies in relation to the relevant day, gives a relevant amount.
(5) The sum of the relevant amounts is the supplier’s collateral requirement for the relevant day.
(6) The supplier is not to be treated as having breached its obligation under paragraph (2) where, after the first occasion on which it provided sufficient collateral to the revenue collection counterparty to meet its collateral requirement for a day—
(a)
the amount of that supplier’s collateral held by the revenue collection counterparty fell below that supplier’s collateral requirement for a subsequent day; and
(b)
by the second working day (“the cure day”) after that subsequent day, the supplier provides sufficient collateral to the revenue collection counterparty to meet its collateral requirement for the cure day.
(7) Collateral may be provided in the form of—
(a)
cash;
(b)
appropriate letters of credit; or
(c)
a combination of the two.
(8) For the purposes of this regulation—
(a)
collateral is held by the revenue collection counterparty where it is provided to the revenue collection counterparty and not called (within the meaning of regulation 21);
(b)
the amount of electricity supplied by a supplier on any day is the amount which the BSCCo determines, on the basis of the most recent BSC volume allocation run carried out by the BSCCo in relation to that day, as the amount of electricity that the supplier supplied on that day; and
(c)
the interim levy rate which applies in relation to a day is the interim levy rate which applies in relation to that day by virtue of regulation 7(3).
(9) Regulation 20 makes further provision about appropriate letters of credit.Appropriate letters of credit
20.—(1) For the purposes of regulation 19, a letter of credit is appropriate if—
(a)
it is issued by a person who holds a required rating; and
(b)
it is provided on terms which the revenue collection counterparty considers are appropriate.
(2) The terms which the revenue collection counterparty may consider are appropriate under paragraph (1)(b) include terms relating to—
(a)
the manner in which any demand for payment under a letter of credit is to be made;
(b)
the manner in which any payment under a letter of credit is to be made; and
(c)
requirements about the holding of funds to meet demands for payment under a letter of credit.
(3) Where an electricity supplier has provided the revenue collection counterparty with a letter of credit issued by a person who ceases to hold a required rating that letter will not constitute an appropriate letter of credit from the 10th working day after the day on which that person ceases to hold that rating.
(4) Subject to paragraph (5), a person holds a required rating if that person has been assessed by—
(a)
Fitch Ratings as having a short term debt rating of “F1” or better;
(b)
Moody’s as having a short term debt rating of “P-1” or better; or
(c)
Standard and Poor’s as having a short term debt rating of “A-1” or better.
(5) Where the revenue collection counterparty is of the opinion that the requirement that appropriate letters of credit must be issued by persons holding a short term debt rating mentioned in paragraph (4)(a) to (c) is too onerous in the circumstances, and subject to having regard to its duty under regulation 28(1), it may issue a notice to BM registered electricity suppliers specifying alternative short term debt ratings, and that notice shall remain in force until such time as it is withdrawn.
(6) In paragraph (5), “BM registered electricity suppliers” means electricity suppliers who have a BM Unit registered as at the day before the date the notice is issued.
(7) The revenue collection counterparty may withdraw a notice under paragraph (5) (“the first notice”) by issuing a further notice (“the withdrawal notice”) to electricity suppliers who were sent the first notice setting out the date from which the first notice is to be withdrawn (that date being no earlier than 10 working days after the day on which the withdrawal notice is issued).
(8) The revenue collection counterparty must, before the first revenue collection contract is entered into, publish a document setting out the terms of letters of credit which it is likely to regard as appropriate for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), and must keep any such document under review and publish any revision from time to time.
(9) In this regulation—
“Fitch Ratings” means Fitch Ratings Limited (registered company number 01316230);

(2) The revenue collection counterparty may issue a notice under paragraph (1) to an electricity supplier if that supplier has failed to make a relevant payment and—
(a)
2 working days have passed since the day on which that supplier should have made that payment; or
(b)
the revenue collection counterparty is of the opinion that there is no prospect of that supplier making that payment by 2 working days after the day on which that supplier should have made that payment.
(3) The amount of collateral which may be called by the revenue collection counterparty where a supplier has failed to make a relevant payment is the lesser of—
(a)
the amount of collateral provided by that supplier; or
(b)
the amount of that relevant payment or, where there is more than one relevant payment which that supplier has failed to make and in respect of which a notice under paragraph (1) could be issued, the sum of all relevant payments in respect of which a notice under paragraph (1) could be issued.
(4) Where the whole or part of a supplier’s collateral which was provided in the form of cash has been called by the revenue collection counterparty, that amount is to be treated as a payment made by that supplier to the revenue collection counterparty at the time that collateral was called.
(5) Where the whole or part of a supplier’s collateral which was provided in the form of a letter of credit has been called by the revenue collection counterparty—
(a)
the revenue collection counterparty must take steps to demand payment from the person who provided the letter in the amount of the lesser of—
(i)
the amount which can be demanded under that letter, or
(ii)
the amount of collateral which has been called; and
(b)
the amount which has been paid to the revenue collection counterparty under that letter is to be treated as a payment by that supplier to the revenue collection counterparty made at the time that amount is received by the revenue collection counterparty.
(6) In this regulation “relevant payment” means any payment which a supplier is required to make by virtue of regulation 7(1), 8(2), 10(1), 13(3), 16(3)(a) or 17(6) which has not been made by that supplier by the time that payment should have been made, and which remains unpaid.Withdrawal of collateral and payment of interest
22.—(1) Where the collateral provided by an electricity supplier and held by the revenue collection counterparty is more than that supplier’s collateral requirement, that supplier may make a request that the revenue collection counterparty repay or return as much collateral as exceeds the supplier’s collateral requirement by giving a notice to the revenue collection counterparty.
(2) Where a request under paragraph (1) has been received by the revenue collection counterparty, it must, before the 2nd working day after the day on which the request was received, repay or return the lesser of—
(a)
the amount requested by the supplier; or
(b)
the amount of collateral which the revenue collection counterparty determines exceeds that supplier’s collateral requirement at the time the payment is to be made.
(3) Where a supplier has provided collateral in the form of cash and the revenue collection counterparty holds that sum in an account which bears interest, it must pay to that supplier an amount equal to any such interest earned in relation to that sum within 15 working days of receiving that interest.The operational costs levy
23.—(1) An electricity supplier must make a payment (“an operational cost payment”) to the revenue collection counterparty for each day that supplier makes an electricity supply during an operational cost period.
(2) The amount of an operational cost payment to be paid by a supplier in respect of a day is equal to the amount of electricity supplied by that supplier on that day, less any amount of EII excluded electricity supplied by that supplier on that day, multiplied by the operational levy rate.
(3) The revenue collection counterparty must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the BSCCo has carried out an Initial Volume Allocation Run in respect of a day in an operational cost period, issue a notice to each electricity supplier who supplied electricity on that day stating the operational cost payment which the supplier to whom the notice is issued must pay in respect of that day.
(4) An electricity supplier must make an operational cost payment in respect of a day by the operational cost payment date in relation to that payment.
(5) The operational cost payment date in relation to an operational cost payment is the 5th working day after the day on which the revenue collection counterparty has issued a notice under paragraph (3) to the supplier who must make that payment.
(6) Where an electricity supplier fails to make an operational cost payment by the operational cost payment date in relation to that payment, that supplier must pay the revenue collection counterparty simple interest on any unpaid amount at the rate specified in regulation 36(1) from the day after the operational cost payment date.

(b)
the amount of electricity supplied by an electricity supplier on a particular day is the amount of electricity which the BSCCo determines, on the basis of an Initial Volume Allocation Run carried out in relation to that day, as the amount of electricity which that supplier supplied on that day.Repayment of excess
24.—(1) The revenue collection counterparty must determine, as soon as reasonably practicable after the conclusion of an operational cost period, whether the amounts received under regulation 23(1) in respect of that period and received by virtue of regulation 23(6) during that period are greater than the costs which it incurred in respect of the relevant period in relation to that operational cost period.
(2) Where the revenue collection counterparty determines that those amounts are greater than those costs it must pay the difference to electricity suppliers as soon as reasonably practicable after making that determination.
(3) Where the revenue collection counterparty must make a payment under paragraph (2), the amount which the revenue collection counterparty must pay to an electricity supplier in respect of an operational cost period is the amount given by—
where—
RA is the sum of—

which a supplier must make to the revenue collection counterparty by virtue of these Regulations within 5 working days of the relevant date;
(b)
which the supplier has not yet made; and
(c)
the amount of which has been determined.

(2) Where the counterparty payment is more than the supplier payment, payment of the counterparty payment less the supplier payment discharges—
(a)
the revenue collection counterparty’s obligation to make the counterparty payment, and
(b)
the supplier’s obligation to make the supplier payment.
(3) Where the counterparty payment is less than the supplier payment, payment of the supplier payment less the counterparty payment discharges—

where part of the payment remains, secondly, to discharge any relevant obligation of the supplier which is not one arising under regulation 23(1); and
(c)
where part of the payment still remains, thirdly, to discharge any relevant obligation of the supplier to make a payment of interest.
(3) Where more than one relevant obligation falls within a subparagraph of paragraph (2), the revenue collection counterparty must determine the order in which those obligations are to be discharged.
(4) On the day on which the revenue collection counterparty uses the payment it must issue a notice to the supplier which sets out the details of—
(a)
any relevant obligation which has been wholly discharged;
(b)
any relevant obligation which has been partially discharged, and the extent to which it has been discharged; and

(3) Where this regulation applies, the amount which may be used to make revenue collection counterparty payments in relation to a particular revenue collection contract is the amount given by—
where—
AH is the total amount held by the revenue collection counterparty;
OG is the amount of revenue collection counterparty payments owed in relation to that revenue collection contract; and
OA is the total amount of revenue collection counterparty payments which the revenue collection counterparty owes.

35.—(1) This regulation applies where a revenue collection contract contains a term that makes reference to amounts allocated pursuant to these Regulations (however that revenue collection contract describes these Regulations).
(2) Where both this regulation and regulation 34 apply, the amount allocated to that revenue collection contract, for the purposes of that term, is the amount calculated under regulation 34(3) which may be used by the revenue collection counterparty to make revenue collection counterparty payments in relation to that revenue collection contract.
(3) In all other cases where this regulation applies, the amount allocated to a revenue collection contract, for the purposes of that term, is the amount which is owed by the revenue collection counterparty in relation to that revenue collection contract.Interest

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations impose a number of obligations on persons who supply electricity in Great Britain pursuant to an electricity supply licence (granted by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority under section 6 of the Electricity Act 1989). Those obligations principally consist of requirements to make payments to the revenue collection counterparty, a person who is designated as such under section 15 of the Nuclear Energy (Financing) Act 2022 (“the 2022 Act”). The payments are made to enable the revenue collection counterparty to meet its costs, which include the costs it incurs in meeting obligations it has under revenue collection contracts. The counterparty is also, in some circumstances, required to make payments to electricity suppliers.
Revenue collection contracts are contracts which the revenue collection counterparty must offer to enter into with a designated nuclear company by virtue of section 18 of the 2022 Act. A designated nuclear company is a company that holds an electricity generation licence in respect of a nuclear energy generation project and has been designated in relation to that project under section 2 of the 2022 Act.
Part 1
Regulation 2 contains definitions used in these Regulations. There are terms used in these Regulations which are defined in the Balancing and Settlement Code. That code is available at available at the following website: www.elexon.co.uk. A hard copy of that code may be requested from Elexon Limited (4th Floor, 350 Euston Road, London NW1 3AW). The Balancing and Settlement Code Company (the BSCCo) makes determinations under that code about the amount of electricity supplied in Great Britain, and these determinations are relied upon for various purposes in these Regulations. Every licensed electricity supplier is a party to that code.
Part 2
Regulation 3 sets out the obligation of electricity suppliers to contribute towards the costs of revenue collection contracts in respect of a quarterly obligation period. There are four such periods a year, each lasting three months. The regulation also provides the obligation of the revenue collection counterparty to make payments to suppliers where a supplier’s contribution in respect of a period is calculated as being a negative number. Whilst this regulation sets out the principal obligation to make such payments, the obligation will be met by the making of interim payments, reserve payments and reconciliation payments.
Regulation 4 sets out the calculation for an electricity supplier’s contribution in respect of a quarterly obligation period. This is calculated in the following way. First the sum of the following amounts is calculated: (a) the amount required to be paid by the revenue collection counterparty under, or pursuant to, revenue collection contracts (or to a party of those contracts for a related breach of duty) during the period; and (b) the amount of financial assistance funds the Secretary of State has provided to the revenue collection counterparty that the Secretary of State has specified is to be used when calculating the contribution for the period (the “SoS Payment”). Second, from the resulting sum, the sum of the following amount is subtracted: (i) the amount of payments the revenue collection counterparty received under, or pursuant to, revenue collection contracts during the period; (ii) the amount of the SoS Payment for the quarterly obligation period that ended three quarterly obligation periods before the period for which the calculation is made; and (iii) the amount of interest payable to the revenue collection counterparty under the regulations. Finally, once the subtraction has been performed, the resulting amount is then multiplied by the fraction of supplier’s share of the electricity market, excluding any EII excluded electricity (within the meaning of regulation 6(1) of S.I. 2015/721).
Regulation 4(3) provides that determinations by the revenue collection counterparty about amounts of EII excluded electricity supplied must be based on information derived from the most recent BSC volume allocation run.
Regulation 5 requires the revenue collection counterparty to determine a rate which applies to a quarterly obligation period. That rate will be the basis on which electricity suppliers make interim daily payments to that revenue collection counterparty during that period. The rate is set on the basis of the amount of money which the revenue collection counterparty believes it will need to make payments under, or pursuant to, revenue collection contracts (or to a party to those contracts for a related breach of duty) during that period, less the amount of money which it believes it will be paid under, or pursuant to, revenue collection contracts during that period. The rate is then arrived at by dividing that amount by the amount of electricity (excluding EII excluded electricity) which the revenue collection counterparty estimates will be supplied during that period.
Regulation 6 sets out the basis on which the revenue collection counterparty must estimate the matters referred to in regulation 5.
Regulation 7 requires an electricity supplier who supplies electricity on a day in a quarterly obligation period to make a payment in respect of that day (an interim rate payment). The payment is calculated by multiplying the rate determined by the revenue collection counterparty by the amount of electricity supplied by that supplier (excluding EII excluded electricity) on that day. The revenue collection counterparty must issue a notice to that supplier once the first information about electricity supply on that day is available (this will be available once the BSCCo has carried out the Interim Information Volume Allocation Run in relation to that day). The supplier must then pay the amount within 5 working days after the day that notice was issued. As a consequence, the payments are likely to be daily payments (subject to how working days fall). The regulation also provides that interest must be paid on amounts which are not paid on time.
Regulation 8 provides for payments to be made by a supplier to the revenue collection counterparty, or by the revenue collection counterparty to that supplier, where the BSCCo revises its determination of an amount of electricity supplied following the carrying out of an Initial Volume Allocation Run or Reconciliation Volume Allocation Run. The payments are made for the purpose of ensuring that the amount paid by a supplier as an interim rate payment reflects, as much as possible, the amount of electricity actually supplied. These payments will not be made after the conclusion of a quarterly obligation period as amounts will be subsequently reconciled once every quarter.
Regulation 9 requires the revenue collection counterparty to calculate a “total reserve amount” to be paid to it in respect of a quarterly obligation period and the share of that amount which each supplier must pay (that supplier’s reserve payment). The revenue collection counterparty must make a determination about total reserve payments at least 30 days before that period and determinations about supplier reserve payments before the end of the period of 8 working days starting with the day which is 30 days before the period.
The revenue collection counterparty determines the total reserve amount by modelling how much money it would need to have during a period to meet all payments it might have to make to the parties to a revenue collection contract (RCC parties). This determination is based upon a probabilistic assessment of the amount the revenue collection counterparty would need in 95% of possible cases.
Regulation 10 provides that an electricity supplier must make reserve payments by the 5th working day after the revenue collection counterparty has issued a notice to them. Each supplier’s reserve payment is calculated by multiplying the total reserve amount for a period by the supplier’s share of the electricity market (excluding EII excluded electricity) for the most recent period of 30 consecutive days for which an Initial Volume Allocation Run has been carried out.
Regulation 11 allows the revenue collection counterparty to vary an interim levy rate, and/or require a further reserve payment from suppliers where, after setting the rate and determining the total reserve amount, it later appears that it will not receive enough money to make all the payments to RCC parties it must make during that period. The regulation also allows the revenue collection counterparty to reduce the interim levy rate if it appears that it will receive significantly more than enough money to make payments to the RCC parties during that period.
Regulation 12 sets out the means for determining an adjusted interim rate. The rate is arrived at in the same manner as the rate determined under regulation 5, but taking into account such payments as have already been made and may be made before the coming into effect of the adjusted rate. An adjusted rate will not have effect before at least 30 days after that rate has been determined.
Regulation 13 sets out the means for determining an additional total reserve amount for a quarterly obligation period, and the share of that amount which each supplier must pay. An additional total reserve amount is arrived at in a similar manner to the total reserve amount. The same probabilistic assessment is made in respect of the payments which must be made by the revenue collection counterparty for as much of the period as remains after the making of the determination. A supplier will have to pay its share of the amount no earlier than 30 days after it has been notified of the amount it has to pay.
Regulation 14 allows the revenue collection counterparty to reduce the total reserve amount without notice by recalculating it where it considers that it would collect significantly more from suppliers than needed in order to make all payments during the reserve period. This needs to be done in advance of the issue of the reconciliation notice which triggers payment of a suppliers’ reserve payment.
Regulation 15 makes provision for the revenue collection counterparty to calculate reconciliation payments which must be made by it to a supplier, or by that supplier to it. Reconciliation payments must be determined in respect of a quarterly obligation period once in every subsequent quarterly obligation. This will happen 10 times.
Regulation 16 sets out the means for calculating a reconciliation payment. To calculate such a payment the revenue collection counterparty must calculate the RCC period contribution of a supplier using the latest data available. This is then compared against the total amount of payments under Chapter 2 and 3 which that supplier was required to pay to the revenue collection counterparty, and which were required to be paid by the revenue collection counterparty to that supplier. The difference between the two determines the amount and direction of a reconciliation payment.
Regulation 17 makes provision for the circumstances in which an electricity supplier defaults on a payment it was required to make. In those circumstances other electricity suppliers can be required to pay further amounts to cover the amount of that default (a mutualisation of that default).
Regulation 18 makes provision for the circumstances where, following a mutualisation of a default, the revenue collection counterparty is able to recover amounts from the supplier who defaulted. In those circumstances, suppliers who were subject to the obligation to pay in respect of that default must be paid a share of the amount recovered, and a share of any default interest which was paid in respect of that default.
Regulation 19 imposes a requirement on electricity suppliers to provide collateral in respect of their obligations under this Part. The amount of collateral which must be provided by a supplier is calculated by reference to the amount of electricity supplied for a recent period of 21 days. A supplier may choose to provide collateral as cash or as letters of credit. As that requirement is calculated daily the requirement may fluctuate and electricity suppliers may have to provide additional collateral. Suppliers will also have to provide additional collateral where their collateral is used (“called”) by the revenue collection counterparty.
Regulation 20 makes provision about the terms of letters of credit which may be provided by electricity suppliers to meet their collateral requirement. The revenue collection counterparty may determine whether the terms of a letter of credit are appropriate. The regulation also makes provision about the required credit rating of a person issuing such a letter.
Regulation 21 contains provision about how collateral is called by the revenue collection counterparty. It may be called by the revenue collection counterparty when an electricity supplier fails to make a payment it is required to make under this Part. The revenue collection counterparty may then issue a notice to that supplier informing it that an amount of that supplier’s collateral is called. This may trigger the requirement to provide further collateral. Where collateral was provided as cash, this cash is treated as having been paid to the revenue collection counterparty and will discharge that supplier’s obligations as a payment would have done. Where collateral was provided as a letter of credit, the obligations of a supplier will only be discharged where the person issuing the letter of credit has paid the revenue collection counterparty under it.
Regulation 22 allows an electricity supplier to request the return of collateral where the amount provided exceeds the amount of that supplier’s collateral requirement at that time. The regulation also provides that any interest which has been earned on the holding of cash collateral by the revenue collection counterparty must be paid to the supplier who provided that collateral.
Part 3
Regulation 23 requires electricity suppliers to make operational cost payments to the revenue collection counterparty. The payments are calculated by reference to the amount of electricity supplied on a day, and a rate specified in this regulation. Payments must be made daily, except in relation to the first operational costs period where the sum of the payments for that period must be made after the revenue collection counterparty has given notice of the amounts of all the payments which are due in respect of that period, so they are, in effect, required to be paid by the same date, which will be after the conclusion of that period.
Regulation 24 makes provision about the circumstances where the revenue collection counterparty has received more in operational cost payments than the amount of its costs. In those circumstances the revenue collection counterparty must pay electricity suppliers any excess based on the amount of electricity supplied over the operational cost period.
Part 4
Regulation 25 makes provision about enforcement of the requirements of electricity suppliers under these Regulations. It enables the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (the Authority) to deal with any breach of such requirements as if those requirements were, in effect, requirements under an electricity supply licence. It also provides for notices to be issued by the revenue collection counterparty where a supplier has breached a requirement to make a payment, or a requirement to provide collateral. In the case of a breach of a collateral requirement, a supplier will then have to provide that collateral as cash.
Regulation 26 enables an electricity supplier to dispute any determination made by the revenue collection counterparty. Determinations about an amount of electricity supplied which is determined by the BSCCo are excluded from this provision.
Regulation 27 sets out the duties of the revenue collection counterparty in relation to the determination of disputes including the steps it must take if it accepts a dispute. It also makes provision dealing with the effect of determinations made following the determination of a dispute.
Regulation 28 imposes general duties on the revenue collection counterparty including a duty in relation to the collection of sums to be paid under these Regulations, and duties to keep electricity suppliers informed of their liabilities under these Regulations.
Regulation 29 makes provision about the issuing of notices by the revenue collection counterparty under these Regulations and the giving of notices by electricity suppliers, including provision about the giving and issuing of notices electronically.
Regulation 30 enables the revenue collection counterparty to set off amounts it has to pay to a supplier against amounts that supplier must pay.
Regulation 31 enables the revenue collection counterparty to net payments due to suppliers against payments due from suppliers. Such payments can be netted against one another automatically where they are due at the same time.
Regulation 32 deals with the circumstances where an electricity supplier makes a partial payment such that not all of its liabilities at that time will be discharged by the making of that payment. In those circumstances that payment will be allocated to the outstanding debts of that supplier in an order determined partially by this regulation and partially by the revenue collection counterparty in its discretion.
Regulation 33 prohibits the revenue collection counterparty from using payments received from a supplier under regulation 23 for any purpose other than meeting its costs. Payments received from suppliers under other regulations may only be used the purposes of making payments under, or pursuant to, the revenue collection contracts (or payments to a party to those contracts for a related breach of duty) and making repayments due to the Secretary of State in relation to funds provided to the revenue collection counterparty by the Secretary of State.
Regulation 34 deals with the circumstances where the revenue collection counterparty does not hold enough money to make all payments it is required to make under revenue collection contracts. In those circumstances the amount that the revenue collection counterparty holds will be divided between the revenue collection contracts such that a proportional share of the total available may be paid under each revenue collection contract.
Regulation 35 contains provision designed to have effect in relation to the terms of revenue collection contracts. The terms of revenue collection contracts may include limited recourse provisions which prevent a party to those agreements from taking steps to recover more from the revenue collection contract than it has raised under these Regulations (or is available from other sources). Regulation 35 applies the apportionment provision in regulation 34 to such revenue collection contracts in accordance with those terms.
Regulation 36 sets out the rate of interest which applies to a requirement of a supplier to pay interest under these Regulations.
Part 5
Regulation 37 sets out the requirements for directions given by the Secretary of State directing the revenue collection counterparty to offer to contract with a designated nuclear company on specified terms.
Regulation 38 sets out requirements for the form and content of the specified terms.
Regulation 39 specifies the procedure that the Secretary of State must following when revoking a direction made under regulation 37 and the effect such a revocation has.
Regulation 40 requires the revenue collection counterparty to publish a revenue collection contract, excluding confidential information, when a designated nuclear company accepts an offer to enter into such a contract.
Regulation 41 contains a definition used in Part 5 of these Regulations.
Part 6
Regulation 42 gives the revenue collection counterparty, the Authority and the Secretary of State power to request information from certain persons in connection with their relevant functions. Persons who receive such requests must comply with them within such period as the person making the request reasonably requires.
Regulation 43 provides that certain persons may provide information (whether or not a request for information has been made) to the revenue collection counterparty, Authority and Secretary of State where the person reasonably considers the recipients requires the information in connection with their relevant functions.
Regulation 44 enables the Secretary of State to request advice relating to revenue collection contracts that is reasonably required in connection with the Secretary of State’s relevant functions, from the revenue collection counterparty, the Authority, or the person operating the national transmission system for Great Britain.
Regulation 45 provides that information or advice provided under Part 6 of these Regulations may not be disclosed to another person subject to certain exemptions.
Regulation 46 sets out various supplementary matters relating to Part 6 of these Regulations. These include provision that requirements imposed on certain persons under Part 6 are to be treated as having effect on that person as if the requirement were a relevant requirement placed on a regulated person for the purposes of section 25 of the Electricity Act 1989 (c. 29).
Regulation 47 contains definitions used in Part 6 of these Regulations.

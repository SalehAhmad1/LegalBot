(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2016 (“the 2016 Order”). The 2016 Order provides for fees to be charged for the exercise of various functions in connection with immigration and nationality. It specifies whether the fees charged are to be fixed amounts or calculated in some other way and also specifies maximum amounts and maximum rates for these fees. The actual amounts and rates that are charged for the exercise of these functions are set by regulations under section 68(7) of the Immigration Act 2014. The current regulations under that section are the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/330) (as amended). Fees set by regulations under section 68(7) may not exceed the maximum amounts or rates specified in the 2016 Order.
This Order increases the maximum amounts chargeable for the exercise of two functions specified in the 2016 Order. The first specified function is the consideration of an application for entry clearance to enter the United Kingdom, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey or the Isle of Man as a visitor for a period of six months or less. The maximum fee which can be set for the exercise of this function is increased from £95 to £130. The second specified function is the consideration of an application for entry clearance to enter the United Kingdom, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Bailiwick of Jersey or the Isle of Man as a student, or for limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom as a student. The maximum fee which can be set for the exercise of this function is increased from £480 to £490.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this Order will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available alongside this Order on www.legislation.gov.uk and from the Home Office, Fees and Income Planning Team, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF.

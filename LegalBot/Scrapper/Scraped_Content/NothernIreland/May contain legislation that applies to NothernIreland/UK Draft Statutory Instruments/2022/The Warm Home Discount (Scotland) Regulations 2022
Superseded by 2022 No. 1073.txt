17.—(1) The adjustments that must be made to the non-core spending obligation for scheme year 12 (“O”) of a compulsory scheme electricity supplier (“C”) are as follows.
(2) O must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph (3) or (4) if I is less than or exceeds S where—
(a)
“I” is the amount of spending incurred by C under Part 4 of the 2011 Regulations in scheme year 11 (as determined by the Authority in accordance with regulation 29(1)(d) of those Regulations);
(b)
“S” is C’s non-core spending obligation under that Part of those Regulations for scheme year 11, as adjusted (where required) in accordance with regulation 14 of those Regulations.
(3) If I is less than S, O must be adjusted by adding an amount equal to 9.4% of (S - I).
(4) If I exceeds S, O must be adjusted by subtracting the lesser of—
(a)
an amount equal to 9.4% of (I - S); and

SCHEDULE 1
Determination of aggregate non-core spending obligation
General
1.  The Secretary of State must determine the aggregate non-core spending obligation for a scheme year (“the current year”) in accordance with this Schedule.
Meaning of “the initial overall spending target”
2.  For the purposes of this Schedule “the initial overall spending target” is—
(a)
£49 million for scheme year 12;
(b)
£51 million for scheme year 13;
(c)
£52 million for scheme year 14;
(d)
£53 million for scheme year 15.
Step one: core group spending estimate
3.—(1) The Secretary of State must estimate the aggregate amount of prescribed rebates (if any) to be provided by scheme electricity suppliers under Part 3 in the current year.
(2) This estimate is referred to in this Schedule as “the CGS estimate”.
Step two: calculation of adjusted overall spending target
4.—(1) The Secretary of State must adjust the initial overall spending target for the current year (“IOST”) in accordance with this paragraph to calculate the adjusted overall spending target.
(2) First, the Secretary of State must—
(a)
review the relevant estimate for the relevant year (with any reduction or increase previously made to that estimate under the 2011 Regulations or these Regulations (as the case may be)) (“RE”);
(b)
increase or reduce RE, if it appears to the Secretary of State that the aggregate amount of benefits provided under the core spending Part in the relevant year will be greater or less than RE; and
(c)
if the Secretary of State increases or reduces RE, adjust IOST in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) or (4).
(3) If RE is reduced, IOST may be increased by an amount not exceeding—
(a)
in scheme year 12, an amount equal to 9.4% of that reduction; or
(b)
in any other case, the amount of that reduction.
(4) If RE is increased, IOST may be reduced by an amount not exceeding—
(a)
in scheme year 12, an amount equal to 9.4% of that increase; or
(b)
in any other case, the amount of that increase.
(5) The Secretary of State must then—
(a)
calculate for the current year the difference between—
(i)
the aggregate amount of benefits provided under the core spending Part in the year a-2 (“amount A”); and
(ii)
the relevant estimate (with any increase or reduction previously made to it) for year a-2 (“amount B”); and
(b)
if amount A exceeds or is less than amount B, in addition to any adjustment made in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), adjust IOST in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (7).
(6) If amount A is greater than amount B, IOST may be reduced by an amount not exceeding—
(a)
in scheme years 12 and 13, an amount corresponding to 9.4% of (A - B); or
(b)
in any other case, (A - B).
(7) If amount A is less than amount B, IOST may be increased by an amount not exceeding—
(a)
in scheme years 12 and 13, an amount corresponding to 9.4% of (B - A); or
(b)
in any other case, (B - A).
(8) The adjusted overall spending target for the current year is IOST as adjusted in accordance with this paragraph.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for the continuation in Scotland of the scheme to reduce fuel poverty established by the Warm Home Discount Regulations 2011 (“the Scheme”). These Regulations re-enact with amendments the provisions made by those Regulations to continue the Scheme in Scotland until 31st March 2026. The Scheme will continue to be administered and enforced by the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority (“the Authority”).
The Scheme continues to place obligations on electricity suppliers (“compulsory scheme electricity suppliers”) who have, or are part of a group of electricity or gas supply companies which has, at least the specified number of domestic customers to incur spending in each scheme year on the provision of benefits to customers in or at risk of fuel poverty. For the scheme year which begins when these Regulations come into force, the specified number of domestic customers is 50,000, and for later scheme years it is 1,000. “Scheme year” is defined in regulation 3 of the Regulations.
Part 3 requires compulsory scheme electricity suppliers, and other electricity suppliers who opt into this Part, to provide rebates of £150 to customers specified by the Secretary of State (“core group customers”). A person can only be specified as a core group customer if the person appears to the Secretary of State—
(a)
to be the owner or occupier of domestic premises in Scotland at which the person is supplied with electricity or gas wholly or mainly for domestic purposes;
(b)
to occupy those premises as their sole or main residence; and
(c)
to be, or, where the person lives with their partner, to be the partner of a person, in receipt of state pension credit guarantee credit.
Specific provision is made to enable persons who would ordinarily occupy premises as their sole or main residence but are in hospital, a care home or a hospice temporarily to be treated as continuing to occupy the relevant premises (see regulation 2 of the Regulations).
Part 4 requires compulsory scheme electricity suppliers to incur other spending for the purposes of reducing fuel poverty. Chapter 1 provides for the calculation, and adjustment, of the amount of spending that suppliers must incur under this Part. Chapter 2 provides for the types of spending which must or may be incurred (broader group customers (Chapter 3), industry initiatives (Chapter 4) and specified activities (Chapter 5)) and the amounts which may or must be incurred on the various types of spending.
Part 5 contains supplementary provisions about procedure for matters required to be approved by the Authority, determination by the Authority of the amounts spent by suppliers, the provision of information to the Authority by suppliers and the provision of information by the Authority to the Secretary of State.
Part 6 makes provision for reviews of the Scheme by the Secretary of State.
Part 7 contains consequential provisions.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Plant Health (Fees) (Forestry) (England and Scotland) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/350) (“the 2015 Regulations”) and the Plant Health etc. (Fees) (England) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/289) (“the 2018 Regulations”). The amendments apply in relation to England only.
In particular—
(a)
they amend the 2015 Regulations and the 2018 Regulations to extend to 31st December 2023 the duration of exemptions from the payment of certain fees in respect of certain consignments of plants, plant products or other objects to be transported to Northern Ireland: respectively, fees in respect of applications to the Forestry Commissioners for a phytosanitary certificate for export (or re-export), and fees in respect of certain pre-export services (regulations 2 and 3(3)); and
(b)
they amend the 2018 Regulations in relation to the fees payable by an importer of a consignment originating in a third country in respect of liability to physical checks and identity checks of plants, plant products or other objects, to reflect the frequency rates of such checks and in respect of certain plants for planting, to provide for a flat rate fee.
They also provide for a transitional period during which fees are not payable for liability to physical checks and identity checks of certain plants and plant products originating in certain third countries, and changes to the categorisation of certain plants and plant products (regulation 3(2) and (4) to (6)).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

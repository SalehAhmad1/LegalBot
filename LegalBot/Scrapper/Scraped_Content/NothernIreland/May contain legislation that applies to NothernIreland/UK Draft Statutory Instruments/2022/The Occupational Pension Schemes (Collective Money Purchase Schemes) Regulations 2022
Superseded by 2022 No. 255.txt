the EV for the period starting on the day the scheme began operating and ending the day before the effective date of the first actuarial valuation is the value that would have been calculated for an EV if an actuarial valuation with an effective date of the date that the scheme began operating had been obtained by the trustees, calculated using the methods and assumptions that would be expected to have been used for such an actuarial valuation;
(d)
an EV is expressed as a percentage of the pensionable salary on the effective date of the actuarial valuation to which it relates (or in the case of the EV referred to in sub-paragraph (c), on the date that the scheme began operating) of all active members on that date;
(e)
the EVs are weighted according to the proportion of the test period to which they relate;
(f)
where an EV (“EV2”) is calculated in relation to a period to which a prior EV (“EV1”) relates, the period to which EV1 relates for the purposes of sub-paragraph (e) is the period—
(i)
starting the day following the effective date by reference to which EV1 was calculated; and
(ii)
ending the day before the period to which EV2 relates;

(i)
starting on the date on which the scheme began operating; and
(ii)
ending with the last day of the reference period for the most recent EV that has been calculated.
(11) A viability certificate must be prepared—
(a)
in respect of the scheme’s first viability certificate, by reference to information as at a date to be agreed between the trustees and the scheme actuary, but not earlier than ten months before the date when the trustees apply to the Regulator for authorisation;

(3B) Subject to paragraph (3C), the application of this regulation and regulations 5A, 6A, 7A, 8A and 9 in respect of a member of a relevant scheme that is a qualifying collective money purchase scheme is not affected by a transfer of the member’s rights to a relevant scheme, where the member has not given consent to the transfer.
(3C) Paragraph (3B) does not apply in respect of the transfer of a member’s rights from a qualifying collective money purchase scheme to a relevant scheme (within the meaning of regulation 2(2)(a) or (b))—

5A.—(1) The description of the charges which are prohibited under regulation 4(1ZA)(b) are charges under a charge structure other than—
(a)
a collective single charge structure; or
(b)
a collective combination charge structure.
(2) In these Regulations, a collective single charge structure is one under which charges are calculated solely by reference to the value of members’ rights under the scheme.
(3) In these Regulations, a collective combination charge structure is one under which charges are calculated by reference to the value of members’ rights under the scheme (‘a collective existing rights charge’) and either—
(a)
calculated as a percentage of the value of contributions made by or on behalf or in respect of members of the scheme towards the scheme (‘a collective contribution percentage charge’); or
(b)
calculated by reference to a period of time and not by reference to contributions made by or on behalf or in respect of members of the scheme towards the scheme or to the value of members’ rights under the scheme (‘a collective flat fee charge’).
(4) For the purposes of regulation 4(1ZA)(b), neither the charge structure, nor the type of collective combination charge structure, that applies to the members may be changed during a charges year.”.

“Assessment of charges – qualifying collective money purchase schemes
7A.—(1) If the trustees make the choice under regulation 6A(1) to assess charges in accordance with this regulation, the following provisions apply.
(2) Trustees must calculate the value of members’ rights under the scheme at reference points set at equal intervals during the charges year of no more than 3 months (but see paragraphs (3), (6) and (7)).
(3) Where trustees change the intervals between reference points chosen for the purposes of paragraph (2) during the charges year, the start of the first new interval must commence on the day following the reference point at the end of the previous interval.
(4) The limit of permitted charges under—
(a)
a collective single charge structure; or
(b)
a collective existing rights charge in a collective combination charge structure,
is exceeded if the charges imposed on the members annually exceed the average of the reference point values multiplied by the applicable percentage.
(5) The applicable percentage is—
(a)
in the case of a collective single charge structure, 0.75%; and
(b)
in the case of a collective existing rights charge in a collective combination charge structure, the percentage in Column 2 of the table—
(i)
in regulation 6A(3), where a collective contribution percentage charge is imposed; and
(ii)
in regulation 6A(4), where a collective flat fee is imposed.
(6) Where members have rights under the scheme at only one reference point referred to in paragraph (2), paragraph (4) is to be read as if the words “average of the reference point values” read “value at the reference point”.
(7) Where members have no rights under the scheme at a reference point referred to in paragraph (2), paragraph (4) is to be read as if the words “average of the reference point values” read “value of members’ rights under the scheme on the final day of the charges year or, if there are no members who have such rights on that day, on the final day on which there are members who have such rights,”.
(8) In this regulation monthly, 2 monthly and 3 monthly intervals are to be treated as equal intervals.
(9) Paragraph (10) applies where the charges imposed on the members include a performance fee payable at the end of the investment period.
(10) For the purposes of paragraph (4), the charge imposed annually on the members in relation to the performance fee may be treated as X divided by Y, where—
(a)
X is the sum of the performance fees accrued in relation to the return earned by the assets in the scheme (“the relevant assets”) during the relevant charges year and each of the preceding charges years, up to a maximum of four preceding charges years, and
(b)
Y is—
(i)
5, or
(ii)
where the investment period is less than 5 charges years, the number of charges years in the relevant period.
(11) Where the trustees choose to calculate the charge imposed annually on the members in accordance with paragraph (10), the trustees must, at the end of each charges year during the investment period, calculate—
(a)
the return earned by the relevant assets during that charges year;
(b)
the performance fee which has accrued in relation to that return.
(12) In this regulation, “investment period” means the total period for which the assets in the scheme are invested in an investment for which a performance fee is payable at the end of the investment period.”.

16.  After regulation 8 (alternative assessment of charges) insert—
“Alternative assessment of charges – qualifying collective money purchase schemes
8A.—(1) If the trustees make the choice under regulation 6A(1) to assess charges in accordance with this regulation, the limit of permitted charges under—
(a)
a collective single charge structure; or
(b)
a collective existing rights charge in a collective combination charge structure,
is not exceeded if, on the first day of the charges year, the charges regime to be applied to members’ rights under the scheme meets the requirement in paragraph (2) and that charges regime is applied to members’ rights throughout that charges year.
(2) The requirement referred to in paragraph (1) is that the charges regime would not result in charges being imposed on the members exceeding the limit of permitted charges when calculated in accordance with regulation 7A, if the assumptions in paragraph (3) and, if the trustees so choose, the assumption in paragraph (4) are made for the purposes of those calculations.
(3) The assumptions to be made for the purposes of paragraph (2) are—
(a)
the value of members’ rights under the scheme will not increase or decrease during the charges year when compared to the value on the first day of the charges year, other than as a result of charges imposed on the members; and
(b)
all the members may leave the scheme at any time during that charges year.
(4) The assumption which may be made for the purposes of paragraph (2) is that, where the charges include a performance fee to which regulation 7A(10) applies, the charge to be imposed on the members in relation to the forthcoming charges year will be X divided by Y, where—
(a)
X is the sum of the performance fees accrued in relation to the return earned by the assets in the scheme during each of the years preceding the charges year in question, up to a maximum of five preceding charges years, and
(b)
Y is—
(i)
5, or
(ii)
where the investment period is less than 5 charges years, the number of charges years in the relevant period.
(5) In this regulation, “charges regime” means—
(a)
the charges to be imposed, and any rebates of charges to be applied, as a percentage of the value of members’ rights under the scheme;
(b)
when they are to be deducted from, or added to, the value of members’ rights throughout the charges year;
(c)
how the value of members’ rights will be calculated for the purposes of imposing or rebating charges.
(6) Where the first contribution made by or on behalf or in respect of members to the scheme is made after the first day of the charges year, paragraphs (1) and (3)(a) are to be read as if “on the first day of the charges year” read “on the date on which the first contribution is made in a charges year”.
(7) Where the trustees make the choice under regulation 6A(1) to assess charges in accordance with this regulation but, during the charges year the charges regime fails to meet the requirement in paragraph (2), the trustees must assess charges for the whole charges year in accordance with regulation 7A.”.
17.—(1) Regulation 9 (member agreement for services)(22) is amended as follows.
(2) In paragraph (1), after “Subject to paragraph (3),” insert “in the case of a member of a relevant scheme (that is not a collective money purchase scheme),”.
(3) After paragraph (1), insert—
“(1A) Subject to paragraph (3), in the case of the members of a relevant scheme (that is a qualifying collective money purchase scheme), the restrictions in regulation 4 (with the exception of regulation 4(1A)) do not apply in relation to advice or a service for which a member has entered into an agreement with a person for the provision of that advice or service, provided the conditions in paragraph (2) are satisfied.”.
(4) In paragraph (2)—
(a)
for “paragraph (1)” substitute “paragraphs (1) and (1A)”;

20.—(1) Regulation 11A (payments to advisers)(23) is amended as follows.
(2) In paragraph (1), the existing text after “applies” becomes sub-paragraph (a).
(3) At the end of that sub-paragraph, insert “; or”.
(4) After that sub-paragraph, insert—
“(b)
to a member of a specified section, if the member is, or was, a worker of a qualifying section employer who participates or has participated in the section.”.
(5) In paragraph (3), after “specified scheme” in both places that it occurs, insert “or specified section, as applicable”.
21.  In regulation 11B (relevant information)(24), after paragraph (7) insert—
“(8) In this regulation, in relation to a specified section, references to a “specified scheme” are to be read as references to a “specified section”.”.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement the new authorisation and supervisory regime for collective money purchase schemes under Part 1 of the Pension Schemes Act 2021 (c. 1) (“the Act”). They also make provision for amendments to secondary legislation in relation to schemes providing collective money purchase benefits.
Part 1 of these Regulations contains introductory provisions. In particular, regulation 3 sets out when one employer is treated as connected with another employer for the purposes of Part 1 of the Act.
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision relating to sections of qualifying schemes. In particular, regulation 4 sets out certain characteristics of qualifying benefits. If a scheme provides a combination of qualifying benefits where these characteristics are different, those benefits must be provided under different sections. Regulation 5 makes provision about where an authorisation granted in respect of an undivided collective money purchase scheme will apply to a section following the division of the scheme into sections.
Part 3 of these Regulations makes provision relating to the authorisation of a collective money purchase scheme. Regulation 6 sets out the information to be included in an application to the Pensions Regulator (“the Regulator”) for authorisation (in addition to the information specified in the Act). Regulation 6 also introduces Part 1 of Schedule 3, which sets out the information to be included in an application in relation to whether a scheme is financially sustainable.
Regulation 7 requires an application for authorisation to be accompanied by a fee payable to the Regulator, which is either a set amount or in certain circumstances an amount to be determined by the Regulator.
Regulation 8 introduces Schedule 1, which sets out the matters that the Regulator must take into account in assessing whether a person involved in a collective money purchase scheme is a fit and proper person. Regulation 8 also makes provision for this assessment in cases where a person involved in a collective money purchase scheme is a body corporate.
Regulation 9 relates to the scheme design requirement. It introduces Part 1 of Schedule 2, which sets out the matters that the Regulator must take into account in deciding whether the design of a collective money purchase scheme is sound.
Regulation 10 introduces Part 2 of Schedule 2, which sets out the information that must be contained in a viability report prepared by the trustees of a collective money purchase scheme. Regulation 10 also sets out more detail relating to the preparation of the viability report.
Regulation 11 introduces Part 3 of Schedule 2 which sets out the information that must be included in a viability certificate provided by the scheme actuary. Regulation 11 also sets out the matters the scheme actuary must have regard to when providing a viability certificate and considering whether the design of the scheme is sound.
Regulation 12 introduces Part 2 of Schedule 3, which sets out the matters that the Regulator must take into account in deciding whether it is satisfied that a collective money purchase scheme is financially sustainable, and Part 3 of Schedule 3 which sets out requirements to be met by a collective money purchase scheme in relation to its financing.
Regulation 13 introduces Schedule 4 which sets out the matters that the Regulator must take into account in deciding whether it is satisfied that a collective money purchase scheme has adequate systems and processes for communicating with members and others.
Regulation 14 introduces Schedule 5 which sets out the matters that the Regulator must take into account in deciding whether the systems and processes used in running a collective money purchase scheme are sufficient to ensure that the scheme is run effectively.
Regulation 15 contains requirements about a collective money purchase scheme’s continuity strategy and sets out information that must be included in the strategy. A continuity strategy is a document setting out how the interests of members of the scheme are to be protected if a triggering event occurs in relation to the scheme. Regulation 16 contains requirements about how the continuity strategy must set out levels of administration charges that apply in relation to members of the scheme.
Part 4 of these Regulations relates to valuation and benefit adjustments. Regulation 17 sets out provisions that the rules of a collective money purchase scheme must contain relating to the determination of the value of the available assets of the scheme, the determination of the required amount and the adjustment of the rate or amount of benefits provided under the scheme. Regulation 17 also makes provision for where trustees of a collective money purchase scheme apply a multi-annual reduction to the rate or amount of benefits provided under the scheme.
Regulation 18 makes provision regarding guidance to which the scheme actuary must have regard when advising the trustees of a collective money purchase scheme.
Regulation 19 makes provision regarding actuarial valuations of the scheme including when the trustees of a collective money purchase scheme must obtain an actuarial valuation and what the valuation must contain.
Regulation 20 sets out the information that must be included in a report given by the trustees of a collective money purchase scheme to the Regulator if a benefit adjustment is not made in accordance with the most recent actuarial valuation or does not take effect in accordance with scheme rules.
Regulation 21 makes provision regarding what must be included in a direction issued by the Regulator under section 23 of the Act (powers of the Pensions Regulator).
Part 5 of these Regulations makes provision about the ongoing supervision by the Regulator of a collective money purchase scheme. Regulation 22 sets out the information which the Regulator may require to be included in the supervisory return (a document which the Regulator may require schemes to submit to it).
Regulation 23 lists the significant events in relation to the scheme, which are events which must be notified to the Regulator by persons specified in the Act. Regulation 23 also sets out further information that must be provided to the Regulator by a person who is required to give notice of a significant event.
Regulation 24 makes provision about risk notices including what must be contained in a risk notice. Risk notices are notices given by the Regulator to the trustees of a collective money purchase scheme under section 29 of the Act (risk notices).
Part 6 of these Regulations makes provision about triggering events and continuity options. Regulation 25 sets out the matters which must be notified by a trustee to employers and relevant former employers if a triggering event occurs in relation to a collective money purchase scheme; and when notifications under section 33 of the Act (notification of triggering events) must be given.
Regulation 26 sets out when an implementation strategy must be submitted to the Regulator for approval. An implementation strategy is a document setting out how the interests of members of a collective money purchase scheme are to be protected following the occurrence of a triggering event.
Regulation 27 sets out the information to be included in an implementation strategy about levels of administration charges in relation to members of the scheme. Regulation 28 sets out other information that an implementation strategy must contain.
Regulation 29 introduces Schedule 6 which sets out the procedure to be followed when a triggering event has occurred and the trustees of a collective money purchase scheme are required, or decide, to pursue continuity option 1 (under which the scheme’s liabilities to each beneficiary are discharged by transfer out of the scheme, or securing the payment of benefits by some other means, and the scheme is wound up).
Regulation 30 applies where a triggering event has occurred and the trustees of a collective money purchase scheme are pursuing continuity option 2 (resolving triggering event). It prescribes the deadline for a scheme’s trustees to notify the Regulator when they believe that a triggering event has been resolved.
Regulation 31 applies where a triggering event has occurred and the trustees of a collective money purchase scheme are pursuing continuity option 3 (conversion to closed scheme). It prescribes the deadline for a scheme’s trustees to notify the Regulator when they consider that preparations for the conversion of the scheme into a closed scheme are complete.
Regulation 32 prescribes the deadline for a scheme’s trustees to submit their first periodic report to the Regulator during a triggering event period, and specifies the information which reports must contain in addition to that required by the Act.
Regulation 33 modifies section 99 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 (c. 48) (trustees’ duties) as it applies to a collective money purchase scheme in respect of which the Regulator has made a pause order under section 44 of the Act (pause orders).
Regulation 34 sets out the administration charges that are not included in the prohibition on increasing charges during a triggering event period for a collective money purchase scheme in section 45 of the Act (prohibition on increasing charges etc during triggering event period). It also applies the provisions of section 45 of the Act to certain receiving schemes.
Part 7 of these Regulations makes provision for amendments to secondary legislation in relation to schemes providing collective money purchase benefits. In particular, regulation 35 introduces Schedule 7 which contains amendments to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Scheme Administration) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/1715), the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/772) and the Occupational Pension Schemes (Charges and Governance) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/879) in relation to collective money purchase schemes.

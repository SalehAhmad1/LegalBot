(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Local Authorities (Mayoral Elections) (England and Wales) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/ 1024) make provision for the conduct of elections of directly elected local authority mayors.
Section 13 of the Elections Act 2022 changes the voting system at elections for local authority mayors in England from the supplementary vote system to the simple majority vote system, also known as “first past the post”. As a consequence of the amendments made by that section to the Local Government Act 2000 the secondary legislation setting out the rules for the conduct of each of those elections requires amending. These Regulations amend the 2007 Regulations to replace provisions relating to the supplementary vote system for the election of local authority mayors with provisions which will provide for first past the post for those elections.
An impact assessment has been produced for the Elections Act 2022 including an Addendum on the “first past the post” provision. No, or no significant, impact on business, charities or the public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

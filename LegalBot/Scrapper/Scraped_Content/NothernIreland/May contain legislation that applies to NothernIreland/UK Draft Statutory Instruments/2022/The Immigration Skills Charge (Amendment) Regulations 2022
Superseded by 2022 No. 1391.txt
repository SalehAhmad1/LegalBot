(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under section 70A of the Immigration Act 2014 (c. 22) and amend the Immigration Skills Charge Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/499) (“the 2017 Regulations”).
The 2017 Regulations provide that a sponsor, subject to certain exemptions, must pay a charge each time it assigns a certificate of sponsorship to a skilled worker. Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the 2017 Regulations by adding exemptions to the requirement to pay the charge in respect of sponsored workers on the Scale-up route and also specific EU national intra-corporate transferees on the Global Business Mobility - Senior or Specialist Worker route who are covered by a commitment in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The Scale-up route facilitates individuals who have the skills needed to enable a scale-up business to continue growing to come to or stay in the UK. The Global Business Mobility – Senior or Specialist Worker route facilitates overseas workers who are senior managers or specialist employees to come to or stay in the UK to undertake temporary work assignments with a UK business that is linked to their employer overseas.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

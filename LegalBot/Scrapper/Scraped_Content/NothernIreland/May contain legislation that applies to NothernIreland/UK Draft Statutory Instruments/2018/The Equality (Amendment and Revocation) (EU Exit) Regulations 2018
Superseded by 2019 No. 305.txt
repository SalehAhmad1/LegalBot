DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations amend and revoke legislation in the field of equality and in particular, they amend: references to enforceable EU rights; new obligations implemented under the European Communities Act 1972; references to EU law; the European Economic Area and specific EU directives and harmonisation provisions. Part 2 amends primary legislation, Part 3 amends subordinate legislation, including subordinate legislation in Northern Ireland. Part 4 revokes retained direct EU legislation which will have no practical application in relation to the United Kingdom after EU Exit.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

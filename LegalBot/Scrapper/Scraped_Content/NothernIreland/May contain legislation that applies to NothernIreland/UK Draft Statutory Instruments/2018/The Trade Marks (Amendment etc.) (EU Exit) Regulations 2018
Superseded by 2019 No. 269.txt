“SCHEDULE 2A
EUROPEAN UNION TRADE MARKS
PART 1
Existing European Union trade marks
A trade mark registered as an existing EUTM to be treated as registered under this Act
1.—(1) A trade mark which is registered in the EUTM Register immediately before exit day (an “existing EUTM”) is to be treated on and after exit day as if an application had been made, and the trade mark had been registered, under this Act in respect of the same goods or services as the existing EUTM is registered in the EUTM Register.
(2) A registered trade mark which comes into being by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is referred to in this Act as a comparable trade mark (EU).
(3) This Act applies to a comparable trade mark (EU) as it applies to other registered trade marks except as otherwise provided in this Schedule.
(4) A comparable trade mark (EU) is deemed for the purposes of this Act to be registered as of the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the application which resulted in the registration of the corresponding EUTM and that date is deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the date of registration.
(5) Section 40(3) and (4) does not apply to the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) under this Part.
(6) Section 67(1) applies in relation to the provision of information and the inspection of documents relating to a comparable trade mark (EU) notwithstanding that there will have been no application under this Act for the registration of the trade mark (and so no publication of an application).
(7) Nothing in this Act authorises the imposition of a fee, or the making of provision by rules or regulations which authorises the imposition of a fee, in respect of any matter relating to a comparable trade mark (EU) (see instead provision made by regulations under Schedule 4 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018).
(8) For the purposes of this Act—
(a)
the date of filing of an application for registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) is the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the application which resulted in the registration of the corresponding EUTM;
(b)
references to the date of application for registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) are to the date of filing of the application;
(c)
where an earlier trade mark is a comparable trade mark (EU), references to the completion of the registration procedure for the earlier trade mark are to the completion of the registration procedure in respect of the corresponding EUTM.
(9) In this Schedule—
(a)
“corresponding EUTM”, in relation to a comparable trade mark (EU), means the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives;
(b)
“the EUTM Register” means the register of European Union trade marks maintained by the European Union Intellectual Property Office.
Opt out
2.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), the proprietor of an existing EUTM may, at any time on or after exit day, serve notice on the registrar that the trade mark is not to be treated as if the trade mark had been registered under this Act (an “opt out notice”).
(2) An opt out notice may not be served where on or after exit day—
(a)
the comparable trade mark (EU) has been put to use in the United Kingdom by the proprietor or with the proprietor’s consent (which use includes affixing the trade mark to goods or to the packaging of goods in the United Kingdom solely for export purposes);
(b)
the comparable trade mark (EU) (or any right in or under it) has been made the subject of an assignment, licence, security interest or any other agreement or document except for an assent by personal representatives in relation to the comparable trade mark (EU); or
(c)
proceedings based on the comparable trade mark (EU) have been initiated by the proprietor or with the proprietor’s consent.
(3) An opt out notice must—
(a)
identify the existing EUTM; and
(b)
include the name and address of any person having an interest in the existing EUTM which had effect before exit day in the United Kingdom, and in respect of which an entry was recorded in the EUTM Register.
(4) An opt out notice is of no effect unless the proprietor in that notice certifies that any such person—
(a)
has been given not less than three months’ notice of the proprietor’s intention to serve an opt out notice; or
(b)
is not affected or if affected, consents to the opt out.
(5) Where a notice has been served in accordance with this paragraph—
(a)
the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM ceases with effect from exit day to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act; and
(b)
the registrar must, where particulars of the comparable trade mark (EU) have been entered in the register, remove the comparable trade mark (EU) from the register.
Entries to be made in the register in relation to a comparable trade mark (EU)
3.—(1) The registrar must as soon as reasonably practicable after exit day enter a comparable trade mark (EU) in the register.
(2) The particulars of the goods or services in respect of which the comparable trade mark (EU) is treated as if it had been registered must be taken from the English language version of the entry for the corresponding EUTM in the EUTM Register.
(3) Where—
(a)
the application for registration of the corresponding EUTM was not filed in English; or
(b)
the second language indicated by the applicant pursuant to Article 146(3) was a language other than English,
a person having a sufficient interest who considers that the English language version is inaccurate may apply to the registrar for rectification of the register by the substitution of an English translation of the relevant authentic text (as determined in accordance with Article 147(3)) verified to the satisfaction of the registrar as corresponding to the authentic text.
Comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from an EU Collective Mark or EU Certification Mark
4.—(1) This paragraph applies where the European Union trade mark from which a comparable trade mark (EU) derives is an EU collective mark or an EU certification mark.
(2) The comparable trade mark (EU) is to be treated as either a collective mark or a certification mark, as the case may be.
(3) The proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU) must, following notice from the registrar, file with the registrar regulations governing the use of the European Union trade mark, submitted pursuant to the European Union Trade Mark Regulation, which had effect immediately before exit day.
(4) Where the regulations referred to in sub-paragraph (3) are in a language other than English they must be filed together with a translation into English verified to the satisfaction of the registrar as corresponding to the original text.
(5) Paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 apply in relation to the translation referred to in sub-paragraph (4) as they apply in relation to the regulations referred to in sub-paragraph (3).
(6) Where the regulations or any translation are not filed in accordance with the above provisions—
(a)
the registrar must remove the comparable trade mark (EU) from the register; and
(b)
the rights of the proprietor shall be deemed to have ceased as from the date of removal.
Renewal of a comparable trade mark (EU) which expires within six months after exit day
5.—(1) This paragraph applies to the renewal of the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) which expires within the period beginning with exit day and ending with the end of the relevant period (and accordingly section 43(1) to (3A) does not apply).

(3) Where the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) is not renewed in accordance with sub-paragraph (2)—
(a)
on, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the expiry of the registration, the registrar must notify the proprietor that the registration has expired and of the manner in which the registration may be renewed; and
(b)
a request for renewal must be made within the period of six months beginning with the date of the notice.
(4) If a request for renewal is made in respect of only some of the goods or services for which the comparable trade mark (EU) is registered, the registration is to be renewed for those goods or services only.
(5) If the registration is not renewed in accordance with the above provisions, the registrar must remove the comparable trade mark (EU) from the register.
(6) Section 43(4) and (6) applies to the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) which is renewed in accordance with the above provisions.
(7) In paragraph (1), the “relevant period” means the period of six months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Restoration of a comparable trade mark (EU)
6.  Where a comparable trade mark (EU) is removed from the register pursuant to paragraph 5, the rules relating to the restoration of the registration of a trade mark (referred to in section 43(5)) apply in relation to the restoration of the comparable trade mark (EU) to the register.

9.—(1) Section 47 applies where an earlier trade mark is a comparable trade mark (EU), subject to the modifications set out below.
(2) Where the period of five years referred to in sections 47(2A)(a) and 47(2B) (the “five-year period”) has expired before exit day—

(b)
the United Kingdom include the European Union.
Rights conferred by registered trade mark
11.—(1) Section 9 applies in relation to a comparable trade mark (EU) but as if—
(a)

the proviso in subsection (3) were omitted.
Effect of claim of priority
12.—(1) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
the proprietor of an existing EUTM has claimed a right of priority in accordance with Article 35; and
(b)
immediately before exit day there is an entry in the EUTM Register containing particulars of that claim of priority (a “claim of priority”).
(2) The proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM is to be treated on and after exit day as having the same claim of priority.
(3) Accordingly, the relevant date for the purposes of establishing, in relation to the comparable trade mark (EU), which rights take precedence is the date of filing of the application for a trade mark in a Convention country which formed the basis for the claim of priority.
Effect of seniority claim
13.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an existing EUTM has a valid claim to seniority of a trade mark which trade mark (the “senior mark”) is a registered trade mark or a protected international trade mark (UK).
(2) The comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM is to be treated on and after exit day as if it had a valid claim to seniority of the senior mark.
(3) Accordingly, where the proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU) surrenders the senior mark or allows it to lapse (whether wholly or partially), subject to paragraph 14, the proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU) is deemed to continue to have the same rights as the proprietor would have had if the senior mark had continued to be registered in respect of all the goods or services for which it was registered prior to the surrender or lapse.
(4) An existing EUTM has a valid claim to seniority of a trade mark where—
(a)
a claim has been filed in accordance with Article 39 or 40; and
(b)
the seniority claimed for the existing EUTM has not lapsed in the circumstances referred to in Article 39.
Determination of invalidity and liability to revocation in relation to claims of seniority
14.—(1) Where pursuant to paragraph 13 a comparable trade mark (EU) is treated as if it had a valid claim to seniority of a registered trade mark which has been—
(a)
removed from the register under section 43; or
(b)
surrendered under section 45,
any person may apply to the registrar or to the court for the declaration set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) The declaration is that if the trade mark had not been so removed or surrendered, the registration of the trade mark would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47.
(3) Where the declaration is that had the trade mark not been so removed or surrendered the registration of it would have been liable to be—
(a)
revoked under section 46 with effect from a date prior to—
(i)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the application which resulted in the registration of the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives where there has been no claim of priority; or
(ii)
the priority date (if any) accorded pursuant to a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 in respect of the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives where there has been a claim of priority; or
(b)
declared invalid under section 47,
the seniority claimed for the comparable trade mark (EU) is to be treated as if it never had effect.
(4) Where pursuant to paragraph 13 a comparable trade mark (EU) is treated as if it had a valid claim to seniority of a protected international trade mark (UK) which has been—
(a)
removed from the register of trade marks maintained by the International Bureau for the purposes of the Madrid Protocol; or
(b)
surrendered under the Madrid Protocol,
any person may apply to the registrar or to the court for the declaration set out in sub-paragraph (5).
(5) The declaration is that, if the trade mark had not been so removed or surrendered, the protection of the mark in the United Kingdom would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47.
(6) Where the declaration is that had the trade mark not been so removed or surrendered the protection of the mark in the United Kingdom would have been liable to be—
(a)
revoked under section 46 with effect from a date prior to—
(i)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the application which resulted in the registration of the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives where there has been no claim of priority; or
(ii)
the priority date (if any) accorded pursuant to a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 in respect of the existing EUTM from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives where there has been a claim of priority; or
(b)
declared invalid under section 47,
the seniority claimed for the comparable trade mark (EU) is to be treated as if it never had effect.
(7) References in sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) to sections 46 and 47 are to those sections as they apply to a protected international trade mark (UK) under an order made pursuant to section 54.
(8) Where a trade mark has been surrendered or allowed to lapse in respect of some only of the goods or services for which it is registered, the declaration in sub-paragraphs (2) and (5) is that if the goods or services had not been removed from the registration, the registration of the trade mark would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47 and sub-paragraphs (3) and (6) shall be construed accordingly.
Procedure for declaration that trade mark would have been liable to be revoked or declared invalid
15.—(1) In the case of proceedings on an application under paragraph 14 before the registrar, the rules relating to applications for and proceedings relating to the revocation or invalidation of a trade mark apply, with necessary modifications.
(2) In the case of proceedings on an application under paragraph 14 before the court, section 74 applies to the proceedings as it applies to proceedings involving an application of the type referred to in section 74(1)(a) to (c).
Assignment of an existing EUTM not registered on exit day
16.—(1) This paragraph applies where before exit day an existing EUTM (or any right in it) is the subject of an assignment (a “relevant assignment”) which immediately before exit day is not recorded in the EUTM Register.
(2) Section 25 applies in relation to a relevant assignment as if it were a registrable transaction affecting a comparable trade mark (EU), subject to the modification set out below.
(3) An application under section 25(1) may only be made by—
(a)
a person claiming to be entitled to an interest in or under a comparable trade mark (EU) by virtue of a relevant assignment of the corresponding EUTM; or
(b)
the proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU).
Effect of a licence of an existing EUTM
17.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an existing EUTM is the subject of a licence (a “relevant licence”) which—
(a)
authorises the doing of acts in the United Kingdom which would otherwise infringe the European Union trade mark; and
(b)
does not expire on exit day.
(2) Subject to any agreement to the contrary between the licensee and the licensor, a relevant licence continues to authorise the doing of acts in the United Kingdom which would otherwise infringe the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM.
(3) Sub-paragraph (2) is subject to—
(a)
the terms on which the relevant licence was granted; and
(b)
such modifications to the terms referred to in paragraph (a) as are necessary for their application in the United Kingdom.

a person claiming to be a licensee by virtue of the relevant licence; or
(b)
the proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU).

(a)
section 25(3) and (4) does not apply until after the expiry of the relevant period; and
(b)
section 25(4)(a) applies after the expiry of the relevant period but as if the reference to six months beginning with the date of the transaction were a reference to eighteen months beginning with exit day.
(7) In paragraph (6)(a), the “relevant period” means the period of twelve months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Effect of a security interest in an existing EUTM
18.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an existing EUTM (or any right in or under it) is the subject of a security interest (a “relevant security interest”) which does not terminate on exit day.
(2) References to the existing EUTM in any document which grants or refers to the relevant security interest are to be read as including references to the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM.
(3) Section 25 applies in relation to a relevant security interest as if it were a registrable transaction affecting a comparable trade mark (EU), subject to the modifications set out below.
(4) An application under section 25(1) may only be made by—
(a)
a person claiming to be entitled to an interest in or under a comparable trade mark (EU) by virtue of the relevant security interest; or
(b)
the proprietor of the comparable trade mark (EU).
(5) Where immediately before exit day there is an entry in the EUTM Register relating to a relevant security interest—
(a)
section 25(3) and (4) do not apply until after the expiry of the relevant period; and
(b)
section 25(4)(a) applies after the expiry of the relevant period but as if the reference to six months beginning with the date of the transaction were a reference to eighteen months beginning with exit day.
(6) In paragraph (5)(a), the “relevant period” means the period of twelve months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Continuity of rights in relation to a comparable trade mark (EU)
19.—(1) References to an existing EUTM or the registration of an existing EUTM in any document made before exit day shall, unless there is evidence that the document was not intended to have effect in the United Kingdom, be read on and after exit day as including references to the comparable trade mark (EU) or the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM.
(2) Subject to any agreement to the contrary, a consent granted before exit day by the proprietor of an existing EUTM to the doing on or after exit day of an act in the United Kingdom which would otherwise infringe the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM is to be treated for the purposes of section 9 as a consent to the doing of that act.
Existing EUTM: pending proceedings
20.—(1) This paragraph applies where on exit day an existing EUTM is the subject of proceedings which are pending (“pending proceedings”) before a court in the United Kingdom designated for the purposes of Article 123 (“EU trade mark court”).
(2) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), the provisions contained or referred to in Chapter 10 of the European Union Trade Mark Regulation (with the exception of Articles 128(2), (4), (6) and (7) and 132) continue to apply to the pending proceedings as if the United Kingdom were still a Member State with effect from exit day.
(3) Where the pending proceedings involve a claim for infringement of an existing EUTM, without prejudice to any other relief by way of damages, accounts or otherwise available to the proprietor of the existing EUTM, the EU trade mark court may grant an injunction to prohibit unauthorised use of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM.
(4) Where the pending proceedings involve a counterclaim for the revocation of, or a declaration of invalidity in relation to, an existing EUTM, the EU trade mark court may revoke the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM or declare the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM to be invalid.
(5) Where the grounds for revocation or invalidity exist in respect of only some of the goods or services for which the existing EUTM is registered, the revocation or declaration of invalidity in respect of the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the existing EUTM relates to those goods or services only.
(6) Where (by virtue of sub-paragraph (4)) the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) is revoked to any extent, the rights of the proprietor are deemed to have ceased to that extent as from—
(a)
the date of the counterclaim for revocation, or
(b)
if the court is satisfied that the grounds for revocation existed at an earlier date, that date.
(7) Where (by virtue of sub-paragraph (4)) the registration of a comparable trade mark (EU) is declared invalid to any extent, the registration is to that extent to be deemed never to have been made, provided that this does not affect transactions past and closed.
(8) For the purposes of this paragraph proceedings are treated as pending on exit day if they were instituted but not finally determined before exit day.
Existing EUTM: effect of injunction
21.—(1) This paragraph applies where immediately before exit day an injunction is in force prohibiting the performance of acts in the United Kingdom which infringe or would infringe an existing EUTM (a “relevant injunction”).
(2) Subject to any order of the court to the contrary, a relevant injunction will have effect and be enforceable to prohibit the performance of acts which infringe or would infringe a comparable trade mark (EU) to the same extent as in relation to the European Union trade mark from which the comparable trade mark (EU) derives as if it were an injunction granted by the court.
PART 2
Treatment of European Union trade marks which expire during the period of six months ending on exit day
Registration of certain expired European Union trade marks
22.—(1) This Part applies to a trade mark which was registered in the EUTM Register immediately before the transitional period but which, as a result of the expiry of the registration of the European Union trade mark during the transitional period, does not fall within paragraph 1(1) (an “expired EUTM”).
(2) An expired EUTM is to be treated as if it were an existing EUTM.
(3) The provisions of Part 1 of this Schedule apply to an expired EUTM as they apply to an existing EUTM subject to the provisions of this Part of the Schedule.
(4) Notwithstanding the entry in the register (under paragraph 3, as applied by sub-paragraph (3)) of a comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from an expired EUTM, the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) is expired until it is renewed in accordance with paragraph 23 (or the comparable trade mark (EU) is removed from the register in accordance with paragraph 23(4)).
(5) In this paragraph, “transitional period” means the period of six months ending with exit day.
Renewal of an expired EUTM
23.—(1) Where the registration of an expired EUTM is renewed in accordance with Article 53 of the Continuing EUTM Regulation the registrar must, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of such renewal, renew the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the expired EUTM.
(2) A comparable trade mark (EU) which is renewed under sub-paragraph (1) shall be renewed for a period of ten years from the expiry of the registration of the expired EUTM.
(3) If the registration of an expired EUTM is renewed in respect of only some of the goods or services in respect of which the expired EUTM was registered before its registration expired, the registration of the comparable trade mark (EU) under sub-paragraph (1) is to be renewed for those goods or services only.
(4) If the registration of an expired EUTM is not renewed within the time period permitted by Article 53 of the Continuing EUTM Regulation—
(a)
the registrar must remove from the register the comparable trade mark (EU) which derives from the expired EUTM; and
(b)
the comparable trade mark (EU) ceases with effect from exit day to be treated as if it had been registered under this Act.
(5) In this Schedule, the “Continuing EUTM Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the European Union Trade Mark(2) as it has effect in EU law.

24.—(1) This Part applies to an application for registration of a trade mark under the EUTM Regulation in respect of which the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) are satisfied (an “existing EUTM application”).
(2) The conditions referred to in sub-paragraph (1) are—
(a)
the application has been accorded a filing date pursuant to Article 32; and
(b)
as at the time immediately before exit day, the application has been neither granted nor refused by the European Union Intellectual Property Office.
Application for registration under this Act based upon an existing EUTM application
25.—(1) This paragraph applies where a person who has filed an existing EUTM application or a successor in title of that person applies for registration of the same trade mark under this Act for some or all of the same goods or services.
(2) Where an application for registration referred to in sub-paragraph (1) is made within a period beginning with exit day and ending with the end of the relevant period—
(a)
the relevant date for the purposes of establishing which rights take precedence is the earliest of—
(i)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the existing EUTM application;
(ii)
the date of priority (if any) accorded pursuant to a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 in respect of the existing EUTM application; and
(b)
the registrability of the trade mark shall not be affected by any use of the mark in the United Kingdom which commenced in the period between the date referred to in paragraph (a) and the date of the application under this Act.
(3) In paragraph (2), the “relevant period” means the period of nine months beginning with the day after that on which exit day falls.
Right to claim seniority where seniority has been claimed by an existing EUTM application
26.—(1) Where an existing EUTM application claims seniority of a trade mark which trade mark (“the senior mark”) is a registered trade mark or a protected international trade mark (UK), the applicant may claim seniority of the senior mark in an application for registration of a trade mark (“a relevant mark”) pursuant to this Part.
(2) The effect of a seniority claim made pursuant to sub-paragraph (1) is that where following the registration of the relevant mark the proprietor of that mark surrenders the senior mark or allows it to lapse (wholly or partially), subject to paragraph 27, the proprietor of the relevant mark is deemed to continue to have the same rights as the proprietor would have had if the senior mark had continued to be registered in respect of all the goods or services for which it was registered prior to the surrender or lapse.
(3) Provision may be made by rules as to the manner of claiming seniority pursuant to this paragraph.
Determination of invalidity and liability to revocation in relation to claim of seniority under paragraph 26
27.—(1) Where a relevant mark has claimed seniority of a registered trade mark which has been—
(a)
removed from the register under section 43; or
(b)
surrendered under section 45,
any person may apply to the registrar or to the court for the declaration set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) The declaration is that, if the trade mark had not been so removed or surrendered, the registration of the trade mark would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47.
(3) Where the declaration is that had the trade mark not been so removed or surrendered, the registration of it would have been liable to be—
(a)
revoked under section 46 with effect from a date prior to—
(i)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the existing EUTM application on which the application for registration of a relevant mark is based where there has been no claim of priority; or
(ii)
the priority date (if any) accorded pursuant to a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 in respect of the existing EUTM application on which the registration of a relevant mark is based where there has been a claim of priority; or
(b)
declared invalid under section 47,
the seniority claimed for the relevant mark is to be treated as if it never had effect.
(4) Where a relevant mark has claimed seniority of a protected international trade mark (UK) which has been—
(a)
removed from the register of trade marks maintained by the International Bureau for the purposes of the Madrid Protocol; or
(b)
surrendered under the Madrid Protocol,
any person may apply to the registrar or to the court for the declaration set out in sub-paragraph (5).
(5) The declaration is that, if the trade mark had not been so removed or surrendered, the protection of the trade mark in the United Kingdom would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47.
(6) Where the declaration is that had the trade mark not been so removed or surrendered, the registration of it would have been liable to be—
(a)
revoked under section 46 with effect from a date prior to—
(i)
the filing date accorded pursuant to Article 32 to the existing EUTM application on which the application for registration of a relevant mark is based where there has been no claim of priority; or
(ii)
the priority date (if any) accorded pursuant to a right of priority claimed pursuant to Article 35 in respect of the existing EUTM application on which the registration of a relevant mark is based where there has been a claim of priority; or
(b)
declared invalid under section 47,
the seniority claimed for the relevant mark is to be treated as if it never had effect.
(7) References in sub-paragraphs (5) and (6) to sections 46 and 47 are to those sections as they apply to a protected international trade mark (UK) under an order made pursuant to section 54.
(8) Where a trade mark has been surrendered or allowed to lapse in respect of only some of the goods or services for which it is registered, the declaration in sub-paragraphs (2) and (5) is that if the goods or services had not been removed from the registration, the registration of the trade mark would have been liable to be revoked under section 46 with effect from a date specified in the declaration or declared invalid under section 47 and sub-paragraphs (3) and (6) shall be construed accordingly.
(9) The provisions of paragraph 15 apply in relation to an application under this paragraph as they apply to an application under paragraph 14.

S.I. 2006/1027 as amended by, S.I. 2008/1959, 2011/1043, 2016/299 and by the Intellectual Property (Unjustified Threats) Act 2017 (c.14), section 3.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) (“the EUWA”) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under paragraphs (c), (d) and (g) of section 8(2) of the EUWA) and paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 of the EUWA (in relation to the charging of fees or other charges by the registrar under the Trade Marks Act 1994 (c.26) (“the 1994 Act”) in connection with the exercise of functions conferred on the registrar by virtue of provision made under section 8(1)).
Schedule 1 to these Regulations inserts new Schedule 2A into the 1994 Act.
Part 1 of Schedule 2A provides that a trade mark which is registered immediately before exit day as a European Union trade mark under Regulation (EU) 2017/1001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the European Union trade mark (OJ No. L 154, 16.6.2017, p.1) (“the EUTM Regulation”) is to be treated on and after exit day as if it had been applied for and registered as a trade mark under the 1994 Act (unless the proprietor opts not to receive such a mark) and the provisions of the 1994 Act are expressed to apply to such marks as they apply to other marks registered under the 1994 Act, except as provided to the contrary.
Part 1 contains provisions which adapt the application of various provisions (for example the raising of relative grounds in opposition proceedings in case of non-use under section 6A of the 1994 Act) which rely upon the applicant or defendant being able to demonstrate that the trade mark has been put to genuine use in the UK, by providing that in considering whether such conditions have been met, there will be included genuine use of the trade mark in the European Union prior to exit day. It also contains provisions setting out the effect on a trade mark derived from a European Union trade mark of transactions (such as the grant of a licence or a security interest) entered into prior to exit day in relation to that European Union trade mark and also the conduct of proceedings which are pending on exit day before the courts in the United Kingdom which have been designated as EU trade marks courts for the purposes of the EUTM Regulation.
Part 2 of Schedule 2A makes provision for European Union trade marks which have expired during the period of 6 months ending on exit day (and which accordingly are not covered by the provisions in Part 1). Subject to their renewal in accordance with the EUTM Regulation, such marks will be treated on and after exit day as if they had been applied for and registered under the 1994 Act and the provisions of Part 1 apply to such marks.
Part 3 provides that where an application for a European Union trade mark is pending on exit day, the applicant may file an application for registration of the same mark under the 1994 Act and such application may claim the filing date, the priority date (if any) and seniority of another national mark (if any) of the application for the European Union trade mark on which it is based. Such an application must be made within 9 months of exit day.
Part 4 provides that where a European Union trade mark is removed from the register prior to exit day and is restored to the register after exit day pursuant to the EUTM Regulation, the proprietor may within a period of 6 months following the restoration request that the trade mark be treated as if it were subject to Part 1. Similar provision applies in relation to an application for a European Union trade mark which is refused and subsequently restored.
Schedule 2 to the Regulations (made pursuant to paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 to the EUWA) makes provision for the payment of fees in relation to trade marks which derive from European Union trade marks pursuant to the provisions in Schedule 1 and provides that the Trade Marks (Fees) Rules 2008 (S.I. 2008/1958) apply to such marks as they apply to other registered trade marks under the 1994 Act.
Schedule 3 contains other amendments to the 1994 Act by removing EU references which are no longer appropriate.
Schedule 4 contains amendments to the Trade Marks Rules 2008 (S.I. 2008/ 1797) which are made under section 78 of the 1994 Act and reflect changes to procedural matters arising out of the amendments to the 1994 Act made under these Regulations.
Schedule 5 contains various consequential amendments, repeals, revocations, transitional and saving provisions arising out of the provisions contained in Schedules 1 to 4 of the Regulations. In particular it revokes the EUTM Regulation and the related Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/626 of 5th March 2018 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/625 of 5th March 2018.

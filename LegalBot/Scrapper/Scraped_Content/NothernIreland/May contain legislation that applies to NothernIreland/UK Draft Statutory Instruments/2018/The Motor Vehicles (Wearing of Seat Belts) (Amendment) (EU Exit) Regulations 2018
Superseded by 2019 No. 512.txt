DateEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under paragraphs (a), (c) and (g) of section 8(2) of the 2018 Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of road safety and, in particular, amend legislation relating to the compulsory use of seat belts in motor vehicles. Part 2 amends primary legislation, Part 3 amends subordinate legislation and Part 4 amends Northern Ireland legislation. These Regulations remove existing powers and duties, in the Road Traffic Act 1988 and the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, to make subordinate legislation for the purpose of implementing an EU Directive as these are no longer needed after the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. These Regulations also adjust language and references to recognise that the United Kingdom is no longer a member State, to eliminate any ambiguity, but otherwise maintain the current seat belt wearing requirements regime intact in the United Kingdom.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared and is available alongside this instrument at www.legislation.gov.uk.

27 March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (“the GPDO”).
Article 3 of, and Schedule 2 to, the GPDO confer permitted development rights in respect of certain development. Where such rights are conferred, an application for planning permission is not required.
Article 2 of this Order amends Schedule 2 to the GPDO by inserting a new Part 12A (Emergency Development by Local Authorities) to permit local authorities in Wales to carry out certain development in an emergency in accordance with that Part. For these purposes, an emergency is an event or situation which threatens serious damage to human welfare in a place in the United Kingdom.
The development permitted is development for the purposes of—
(a)
preventing an emergency,
(b)
reducing, controlling or mitigating the effects of an emergency, or
(c)
taking other action in connection with an emergency.
The permitted development is subject to conditions which are also set out in the new Part 12A.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

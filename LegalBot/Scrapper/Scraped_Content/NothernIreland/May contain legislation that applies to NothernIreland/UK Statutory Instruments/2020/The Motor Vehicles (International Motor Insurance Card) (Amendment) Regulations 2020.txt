“SCHEDULE
  ”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Motor Vehicles (International Motor Insurance Card) Regulations 1971 (S.I. 1971/792) (the 1971 Regulations) and the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks) Regulations 1972 (S.I. 1972/1217) (the 1972 Regulations).
They allow the international motor insurance card (more commonly known as a Green Card, but formally defined as an insurance card) used by motorists visiting Great Britain to be white, as well as green in colour (regulation 3) and, from IP completion day (as defined in section 39(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 as 11pm on 31st December 2020), to be in electronic, as well as printed form (regulation 4). They make changes to the information which a valid Green Card must contain (regulation 5) and the format in which it must be presented (regulation 6, which inserts a new template Green Card into the Schedule to the 1971 Regulations).
These Regulations amend the 1972 Regulations to enable motorists visiting Great Britain from Andorra and Serbia to evidence motor insurance by way of a document (other than a Green Card) issued by the insurer of the vehicle (regulation 8). They also allow this document, from IP completion day, and for all vehicles visiting from the European Economic Area (the EEA), Andorra and Serbia (which together make up the Green Card free circulation zone) to be in printed or electronic form (regulation 8).
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An explanatory memorandum is available alongside these Regulations on the UK legislation website at www.legislation.gov.uk.

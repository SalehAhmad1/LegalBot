(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Insurance Contributions Act 2014 (c.7) (“the Act”). Persons who incur liabilities to pay secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions during a tax year are entitled under section 1 of the Act to claim an allowance, known as the “employment allowance”, which they can deduct from their payments in respect of these liabilities. Regulation 2 amends section 1(2)(a) of the Act so as to increase the maximum amount of the employment allowance from £3,000 to £4,000 for the tax year 2020-21 and subsequent tax years.

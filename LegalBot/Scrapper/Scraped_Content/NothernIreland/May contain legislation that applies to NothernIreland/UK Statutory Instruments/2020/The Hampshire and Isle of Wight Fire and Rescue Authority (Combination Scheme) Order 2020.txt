(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order creates a combination scheme (“the Scheme”) which combines the areas of the Hampshire Fire and Rescue Authority and the Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Authority (“the existing authorities”) into a combined fire and rescue authority. The area of the combined authority comprises the areas of Hampshire County Council, Isle of Wight Council, Portsmouth City Council and Southampton City Council. The Scheme comes into force on 1st April 2020 for the purpose of doing anything necessary to bring the Scheme fully into operation on 1st April 2021. The fire and rescue authority for the combined area is to be known as the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Authority (“the Authority”). The Scheme provides for the appointment and terms of office of its members, and for meetings of the Authority. The Scheme also provides for the transfer of staff, and certain property, rights and liabilities directly from the existing authorities to the Authority.
This Order also revokes the Hampshire Fire Service (Combination Scheme) Order 1996 (S.I. 1996/2923) and transfers the relevant fire functions and funding from the existing authorities to the Authority. This Order also omits the parts of the Fire and Rescue Authority (Membership) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/1165) that relate to Hampshire Fire and Rescue Authority and makes equivalent provision in the Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

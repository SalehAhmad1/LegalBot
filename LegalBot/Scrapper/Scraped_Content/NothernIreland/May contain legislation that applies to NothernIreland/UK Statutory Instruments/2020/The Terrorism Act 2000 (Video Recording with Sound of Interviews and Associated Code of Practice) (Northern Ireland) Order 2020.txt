(This note is not part of the Order)
Article 2(1) of this Order requires that any interview by a constable of a person detained under section 41 of, or Schedule 7 to, the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11, “the Act”) which takes place in a police station in Northern Ireland is to be video recorded with sound. (A reference to a police station includes a reference to any place which the Secretary of State has designated under paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 8 to the Act as a place where a person may be detained under section 41.) Article 2(2) further requires that any such interview must be video recorded in accordance with the revised code of practice and Article 2(3) defines that revised code of practice as being the one referred to in Article 3. Article 3 brings that code of practice into force. Article 4 revokes the Terrorism Act 2000 (Video Recording of Interviews) Order 2000 (S.I. 2000/3179) and the Terrorism Act 2000 (Code of Practice on Video Recording of Interviews) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/1100), which brought into force previous versions of the code of practice.

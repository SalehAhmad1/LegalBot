(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) (“the principal Regulations”) to—
(a)
remove Austria, Croatia and Trinidad and Tobago from the list of exempt countries and territories, in Schedule A1 to the principal Regulations, from which passengers arriving in England are not required to self-isolate;
(b)
add Portugal to that list;
(c)
amend the list of specified competitions in Schedule 3 to the principal Regulations, which is relevant to the exemption from the requirement to self-isolate for elite sportspersons.
Passengers are not required to self-isolate on arrival in England if, during the 14 days preceding their arrival, they have only been in or transited through exempt countries or territories. Passengers who have been in or transited through a non-exempt country or territory must self‑isolate until 14 days have elapsed since the day after they last left a non-exempt country or territory. The changes to Schedule A1 will not affect passengers who arrive in England before 4.00 a.m. on 22nd August 2020.
Regulation 4 revokes the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) (Amendment) (No. 9) Regulations 2020, which have not yet come into force, due to a clerical error in the physical document that was signed by the Secretary of State.

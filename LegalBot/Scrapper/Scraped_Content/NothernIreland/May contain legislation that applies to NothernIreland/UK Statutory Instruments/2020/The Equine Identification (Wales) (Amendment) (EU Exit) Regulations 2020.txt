6 November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 11M(1) of Schedule 2 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16). The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement requires that the EU legislation listed in Annex 2 to that Protocol is implemented in Northern Ireland. These Regulations therefore amend the Equine Identification (Wales) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/250 (W. 62)) in order to implement the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland and for the purposes of dealing with matters arising out of, or related to, that Protocol.
These Regulations amend the Equine Identification (Wales) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, which make amendments to the Equine Identification (Wales) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/57 (W. 20)) to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

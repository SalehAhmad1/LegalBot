(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Consumer Credit (Enforcement, Default and Termination Notices) Regulations 1983 (the “1983 Regulations”) which prescribe the form of the notices which have to be given under sections 76, 87 and 98 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (the ‘Act’) by a creditor or owner before taking certain action to enforce or terminate an agreement regulated by the Act.
Regulation 5 amends the requirements to give prominence to certain lettering in a notice by restricting the amount of text which must be made prominent and restricting the methods for doing so to bold print or underlining. Regulation 6 prohibits statements reproduced in a notice using capital letters for text given in lower case. Regulation 7 provides options to replace the word “surety” where it would otherwise appear in a notice.
Regulation 9 provides for a six-month transitional period in which notices will continue to be effective if made in compliance with the requirements of the 1983 Regulations without the amendments made by these Regulations.
The Schedule amends the form of the notices found in Schedules 1 to 3 of the 1983 Regulations. In particular, Part 2 replaces Schedule 2 of the 1983 Regulations, which governs the form of default notices.

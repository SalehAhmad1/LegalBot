30th January 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Employment and Support Allowance (Transitional Provisions, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit) (Existing Awards) (No. 2) Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/1907) (the “Existing Awards Regulations”). The Existing Awards Regulations make provision for the payment of a transitional addition to certain claimants whose existing awards of income support, incapacity benefit or severe disablement allowance have been converted to an award of an employment and support allowance (“ESA”). Regulation 21 of the Existing Awards Regulations provides for the termination of the transitional addition.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations removes the end date of 5th April 2020 for the payment of transitional additions to ESA claimants. Payment of a claimant’s transitional addition will now end when it reduces to nil or when the claimant’s entitlement to ESA comes to an end.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

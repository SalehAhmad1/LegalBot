23rd September 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide that certain provisions of Part 2 of Schedule 4 to the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (c.12) (“CIGA”) cease to have effect from 1st October 2020.
Part 2 of Schedule 4 to CIGA makes temporary provisions for the purposes of a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act 1986 (c.45). Those temporary provisions relax the conditions for obtaining a moratorium as well as modifying how it is to be monitored and extended. Paragraph 1(b) of Schedule 4 provides that the temporary provisions in Part 2 of that Schedule cease to have effect on 30th March 2021.
Regulation 2 provides that certain provisions in Part 2 of Schedule 4 to the Act cease to have effect at an earlier date, on 1st October 2020.
Regulation 3 is a saving provision and disapplies regulation 2 in respect of moratoriums that have either come into force or, in cases where a moratorium may only be obtained upon application to the court, the application has been made before 1st October 2020.

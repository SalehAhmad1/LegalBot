23rd April 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1), and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The amendments are made to legislation governing environmental impact assessment for highway schemes of the Secretary of State, the Welsh Ministers and Highways England via regulation 3, and for harbour schemes via regulation 2.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside these Regulations on the UK legislation website www.legislation.gov.uk.

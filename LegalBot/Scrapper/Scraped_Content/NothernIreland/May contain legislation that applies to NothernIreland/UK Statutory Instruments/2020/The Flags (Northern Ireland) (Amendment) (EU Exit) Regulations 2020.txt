(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the power in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
In accordance with section 8(2)(e) of that Act, the Regulations amend legislation which deals with arrangements which are no longer appropriate as a result of withdrawal. The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 (S.R. 2000/347) which make provision for when flags may be flown on government buildings and court buildings in Northern Ireland are amended. In particular those Regulations require the flying of the Union flag, and where a building has two flagpoles, the European flag, on Europe Day (May 9th). These Regulations remove those requirements.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

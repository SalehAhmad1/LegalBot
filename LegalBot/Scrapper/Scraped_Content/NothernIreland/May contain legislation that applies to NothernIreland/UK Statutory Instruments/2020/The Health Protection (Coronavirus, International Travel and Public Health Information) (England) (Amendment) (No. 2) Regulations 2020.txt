Department for TransportEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/568) (“the International Travel Regulations”) to:
(a)
amend the requirement to self-isolate (regulation 4 of the International Travel Regulations) so that it applies to people who have, within the 10 days prior to their arrival in England, been in or transited through a non-exempt country or territory;
(b)
amend the length of time for which a person is required to self-isolate so that a person must self-isolate until the end of the 10th day after the day on which they last departed from or transited through such a country or territory, or until they depart from England or become required to self-isolate under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Self-Isolation) (England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1045);
(c)
amend the list of exempt countries and territories by adding Botswana and Saudi Arabia and removing the Canary Islands.
Consequential amendments are made to:
(a)
the information that passengers are required to provide under Schedule 1 to the International Travel Regulations; and
(b)
the information that operators are required to provide to passengers under the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health Information for Passengers Travelling to England) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/567).
These Regulations also correct drafting errors in the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) (Amendment) (No. 26) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1337), which themselves amend the International Travel Regulations with effect from 15th December 2020.

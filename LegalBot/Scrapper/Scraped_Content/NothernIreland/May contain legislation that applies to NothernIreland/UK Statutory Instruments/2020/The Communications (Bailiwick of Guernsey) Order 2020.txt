(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends the amendments of the Communications Act 2003 (c. 21) made by sections 88 and 89 of the Digital Economy Act 2017 (c. 30) to the Bailiwick of Guernsey. The amendments in section 88 of the 2017 Act (functions of Ofcom in relation to the BBC) amend section 198 of, and insert section 198ZA into, the 2003 Act and come into force in the Bailiwick of Guernsey on 1st May 2020. The amendments in section 89 of the 2017 Act (TV licence fee concessions by reference to age) amend section 365 of, and insert section 365A into, the 2003 Act; as extended, they place a duty on the BBC to consult the Policy and Resources Committee of the States of Guernsey before making, varying or revoking a determination under the section. The amendments in section 89 of the 2017 Act come into force in the Bailiwick of Guernsey on 1st June 2020. From that date this concession will no longer be determined by regulations but determined independently by the BBC following consultation. The BBC will have the power to make changes to the concession, including changing the eligibility criteria, level of concession and qualifying age (although this may not be lower than 65) or to end the concession. The Secretary of State retains the power to make provision for all other concessions including the current residential care concession or its equivalent.

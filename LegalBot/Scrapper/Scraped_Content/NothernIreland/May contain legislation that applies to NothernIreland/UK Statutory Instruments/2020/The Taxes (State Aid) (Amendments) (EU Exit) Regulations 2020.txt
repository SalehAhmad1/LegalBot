9th December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend various provisions of tax legislation to ensure the effective operation of that legislation at the end of the implementation period.
Part 1 provides for introductory provisions, Part 2 amends primary legislation and Part 3 amends subordinate legislation.
The Regulations make amendments to certain tax legislation in connection with the State Aid (Revocations and Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1470) that have been made under section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16)) (the “EUWA 2018”) to remedy deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. The amendments will not affect the application of European Union State aid law under Article 10 and Annex 5 of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland in the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU on 19th October 2019(1), which will have effect in domestic law under section 7A of the EUWA 2018.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared for this Instrument as it contains no substantive changes to tax policy.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (g) of subsection (2)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 makes amendments to the rules governing trade with countries in goods that could be used for the purpose of capital punishment or torture etc. by amending Council Regulation (EU) 2019/125 of 16 January 2019. The changes are made to ensure that these rules operate as UK rules after withdrawal. For instance, references to the supply of such goods and associated services to non-EU countries become references to the supply of such goods and associated services to all other countries; types of EU proforma authorisations are adjusted to become types of UK authorisations; powers on the part of the European Commission to make EU tertiary legislation to amend relevant annexes to bring goods within scope of the Regulation become powers to amend these annexes by domestic secondary legislation; and inter-member State notification requirements are omitted.
Regulation 3 makes transitional provision in relation to Regulation (EU) 2019/125 of 16 January 2019.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

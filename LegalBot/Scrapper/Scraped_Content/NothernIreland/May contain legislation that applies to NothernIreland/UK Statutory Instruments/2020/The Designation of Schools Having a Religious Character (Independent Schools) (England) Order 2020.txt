28th August 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order designates the independent schools listed in article 2(1) as having the religious character specified in article 2(2) in relation to that school and revokes the instruments listed in article 3 to the extent set out in that article. All the revocations relate to schools that have closed except for the revocation in respect of All Saints Academy Cheltenham (the same school designated in article 2 albeit as All Saints’ Academy, Cheltenham – its correct legal name). Prior to the making of this Order the school had a dual designation of Church of England and Roman Catholic; this is revoked by article 3 and replaced by a new sole designation of Church of England under article 2.
Under section 124A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, independent schools which are so designated are permitted to take account of certain religious or denominational considerations when making specified employment decisions relating to teaching staff (such as decisions on appointment or promotion).
Designation by this Order is not of itself a means of acquiring a religious character or of changing religious character. Designation is the recognition of certain existing attributes of the school or its governing body as described in the Religious Character of Schools (Designation Procedure) (Independent Schools) (England) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/2314, as amended by S.I. 2004/2262).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant,impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

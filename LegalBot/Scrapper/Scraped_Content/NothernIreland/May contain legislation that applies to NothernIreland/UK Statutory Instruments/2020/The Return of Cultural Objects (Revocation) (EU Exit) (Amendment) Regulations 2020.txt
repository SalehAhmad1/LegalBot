(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
When commenced, the Return of Cultural Objects (Revocation) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1086) revoke the Return of Cultural Objects Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/501) and the Return of Cultural Objects (Amendment) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1926), but save them in respect of any application by a Member State for return of a cultural object received by the Secretary of State before exit day or any claim that has been properly filed with the competent court. These Regulations provide that such provisions, instead, will be saved in respect of any application by a Member State for return of a cultural object where that application is received by the Secretary of State before IP completion day.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

the new street to be substituted for it, which is specified in column (4) of that Part of that Schedule, has been completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority and is open for use; or
(b)
a temporary alternative route for the passage of such traffic as could have used the street to be stopped up is first provided and subsequently maintained by the Authority, to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority, between the commencement and termination points for the stopping up of the street until the completion and opening of the new street in accordance with sub-paragraph (a).
(3) No street specified in columns (1) and (2) of Part 2 of Schedule 3 (being a street to be stopped up for which no substitute is to be provided) is to be wholly or partly stopped up under this article unless the condition specified in paragraph (4) is satisfied in relation to all the land which abuts on either side of the street to be stopped up.
(4) The condition referred to in paragraph (3) is that—
(a)
the Authority is in possession of the land; or
(b)
there is no right of access to the land from the street concerned; or

there is reasonably convenient access to the land otherwise than from the street concerned; or
(d)
the owners and occupiers of the land have agreed to the stopping up.
(5) Where a street has been stopped up under this article—

subject to paragraph (3), prevent all persons from passing along the street.
(2) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph (1), the Authority may use any street stopped up under the powers conferred by this article as a temporary working site.
(3) The Authority must provide reasonable access for pedestrians going to or from premises abutting a street affected by the exercise of the powers conferred by this article if there would otherwise be no such access.

(a)
in relation to any street specified as mentioned in paragraph (4), without first consulting the street authority; and

15.  The Authority may, for the purposes of the construction, operation or maintenance of the authorised works, form and lay out such means of access, or improve such existing means of access, at such locations within the Order limits or the limits of deviation as the Authority reasonably requires for the purposes of the authorised works, as may be approved by the highway authority, but such approval must not be unreasonably withheld.Construction and maintenance of new, altered or diverted highways
16.—(1) Any highway to be constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway authority and must, unless otherwise agreed by the highway authority and the Authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the Authority for a period of 12 months from its completion and at the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the highway authority.
(2) Where a highway is altered or diverted under this Order, the altered or diverted part of the highway must, when completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway authority, unless otherwise agreed, be maintained by and at the expense of the Authority for a period of 12 months from its completion and after the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the highway authority.
(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply in relation to the structure of any bridge carrying a highway over a tramroad of the Authority or carrying a tramroad of the Authority over a highway and except as provided in those paragraphs the Authority is not liable to maintain the surface of any highway in, on, under or over which the scheduled works are constructed, or the immediate approaches to any such highway, unless otherwise agreed with the highway authority.
(4) In any action against the Authority in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a highway under this article, it is a defence (without affecting any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the Authority had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the highway to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(5) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (4), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the highway including its use for a tramway, and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a highway of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the highway;
(d)
whether the Authority knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the highway to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the highway; and
(e)
where the Authority could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the highway before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant that the Authority had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of that part of the highway to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the Authority had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the highway and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.Restoration of streets if street tramway discontinued
17.  If the Authority abandons the construction of, or permanently ceases to operate any of, the authorised street tramway (“the discontinued tramway”), it must as soon as reasonably practicable and unless otherwise agreed with the street authority—
(a)
remove from any street in which the discontinued tramway is laid the rails and any other works, equipment and apparatus which have become redundant; and
(b)
restore, to the reasonable satisfaction of the street authority, the portion of the street along which the discontinued tramway was laid, or redundant works, equipment and apparatus were laid, regard being had to—
(i)
the condition of the street before the tramway was laid; and
(ii)
the nature of the traffic using the street at the time of the discontinuance.Agreements with street authorities

(2) Such an agreement may, without limitation on the scope of paragraph (1)—
(a)
provide for the street authority to carry out any function under this Order which relates to the street in question; and
(b)
contain such terms as to payment and otherwise as the parties consider appropriate.Level crossings

(2) The Authority may provide, maintain and operate at or near any level crossing such protective equipment as it may determine.
(3) Any traffic sign placed under this article on or near a highway or other road to which the public has access is to be treated for the purposes of section 64(4)(1) (general provisions as to traffic signs) of the 1984 Act as having been placed as provided by that Act.
(4) Without limitation on the scope of article 10 (power to alter layout, etc., of streets), the Authority may in the exercise of the powers conferred by this article alter the level of any highway or road referred to in paragraph (1).
(5) The highway authority may enter into agreements with the Authority with respect to the construction and maintenance of any level crossing; and such an agreement may contain such terms as to payment or otherwise as the parties consider appropriate.

21.—(1) The Authority may use any watercourse or any public sewer or drain for the drainage of water in connection with the construction, operation or maintenance of the authorised works and for that purpose may lay down, take up and alter pipes and may, on any land within the Order limits, or the limits of deviation in any street along which the authorised tramway is authorised to be laid, make openings into, and connections with, the watercourse, sewer or drain.
(2) Any dispute arising from the exercise of the power conferred by paragraph (1) to connect to or use a public sewer or drain is to be determined as if it were a dispute under section 106 (right to communicate with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991(1).
(3) The Authority must not discharge any water into any watercourse, public sewer or drain except with the consent of the person to whom it belongs; and such consent may be given subject to such terms and conditions as that person may reasonably impose but must not be unreasonably withheld.
(4) The Authority must not make any opening into any public sewer or drain except—
(a)
in accordance with plans approved by the person to whom the sewer or drain belongs, but such approval must not be unreasonably withheld; and
(b)
where that person has been given the opportunity to supervise the making of the opening.
(5) The Authority must not, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this article, damage or interfere with the bed or banks of any watercourse forming part of a main river.
(6) The Authority must take such steps as are reasonably practicable to secure that any water discharged into a watercourse or public sewer or drain under the powers conferred by this article is as free as may be practicable from gravel, soil or other solid substance, oil or matter in suspension.

1991 c. 57.Works to safeguard buildings and the operation of the authorised tramway
22.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this article, the Authority may at its own expense and from time to time carry out such safeguarding works to any building lying within the Order limits or the limits of deviation as the Authority considers to be necessary or expedient.
(2) Safeguarding works may be carried out—
(a)
at any time before or during the construction, in the vicinity of the building, of any part of the authorised works (other than works authorised by this article); or
(b)
after the completion of the construction of that part of the authorised works (other than works authorised by this article), at any time up to the end of the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which that part of the authorised works is first opened for use.
(3) For the purpose of determining how the functions under this article are to be exercised the Authority may, subject to paragraph (5), enter and survey any building falling within paragraph (1) and any land within its curtilage.
(4) For the purpose of carrying out safeguarding works under this article to a building the Authority may (subject to paragraphs (5) and (6))—
(a)
enter the building and any land within its curtilage; and
(b)
where the works cannot be carried out reasonably conveniently without entering land which is adjacent to the building but outside its curtilage, enter the adjacent land (but not any building erected on it).
(5) Before exercising—
(a)
a right under paragraph (1) to carry out safeguarding works to a building;
(b)
a right under paragraph (3) to enter a building and any land within its curtilage;
(c)
a right under paragraph (4)(a) to enter a building and land within its curtilage; or
(d)
a right under paragraph (4)(b) to enter land,
the Authority must, except in the case of emergency, serve on the owners and occupiers of the building or land not less than 14 days’ notice of its intention to exercise that right and, in a case falling within sub-paragraph (a) or (c), specifying the safeguarding works proposed to be carried out.
(6) Where notice is served under paragraph (5)(a), (5)(c) or (5)(d), the owner or occupier of the building or land concerned may, by serving a counter-notice within the period of 10 days beginning with the day on which the notice was served, require the question of whether it is necessary or expedient to carry out the safeguarding works or to enter the building or land to be referred to arbitration under article 53 (arbitration).
(7) The Authority must compensate the owners and occupiers of any building or land in relation to which the powers conferred by this article have been exercised for any loss or damage arising to them by reason of the exercise of those powers.
(8) Where—
(a)
safeguarding works are carried out under this article to a building; and
(b)
within the period of 5 years beginning with the day on which the part of the authorised works constructed within the vicinity of the building is first opened for use, it appears that the safeguarding works are inadequate to protect the building against damage caused by the construction or operation of that part of the works,
the Authority must compensate the owners and occupiers of the building for any damage sustained by them.
(9) Without affecting article 38 (no double recovery), nothing in this article relieves the Authority from any liability to pay compensation under section 10(2)(1) (further provision as to injurious affection) of the 1965 Act.
(10) Any compensation payable under paragraph (7) or (8) is to be determined, in case of dispute, under Part 1 (determination of questions of disputed compensation) of the 1961 Act.

MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act, substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 5 to the Midland Metro (Birmingham Eastside Extension) Order 2020(1) (“the 2020 Order)),
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 5 to the 2020 Order) to acquire an interest in the land, and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land where it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(2) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for the words “land is acquired or taken” substitute “a right over land is purchased”; and
(b)
for the words “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 29 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 28 (power to acquire land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right under article 31(1) (power to acquire new rights)—
(a)
with the modification specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(3) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 29(1)), it has power, exercisable in the equivalent circumstances and subject to the equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A(4) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(5) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(6) (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13(7) (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(8) (protection for interests of tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 29(7) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—

7.  If the acquiring authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.

Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the proposed use of the right, and
(c)
if the right is proposed to be acquired for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

(3) Where any apparatus of public utility undertakers or of an operator of an electronic communications code network is removed in pursuance of a notice or order given or made under section 271, 272 or 273 of the 1990 Act, as applied by sub-paragraph (1), any person who is the owner or occupier of premises to which a supply was given from that apparatus is entitled to recover from the Authority compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of effecting a connection between the premises and any other apparatus from which a supply is given.
(4) Sub-paragraph (3) does not apply in the case of the removal of a public sewer, but where such a sewer is removed in pursuance of such a notice or order as is mentioned in that paragraph, any person who is—
(a)
the owner or occupier of premises the drains of which communicated with that sewer; or
(b)
the owner of a private sewer which communicated with that sewer,
is entitled to recover from the Authority compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of making that person’s drain or sewer communicate with any other public sewer or with a private sewage disposal plant.
(5) The provisions of the 1990 Act mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), as applied by that sub-paragraph, do not have effect in relation to apparatus as respects which paragraph 2, or Part 3 of the 1991 Act applies (including that Part as applied by article 5 (application of the 1991 Act)).
(6) In this paragraph—
“electronic communications code” means the code set out in Schedule 3A to the Communications Act 2003(3);
“electronic communications code network” means an electronic communications network within the meaning of the Communications Act 2003 to which the electronic communications code applies; and

Apparatus of statutory undertakers, etc, in stopped up streets
2.—(1) Where a street is stopped up under article 13 (stopping up of streets) any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, over, along or across the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus, subject to the provision of this paragraph, as if this Order had not been made.
(2) Where a street is stopped up under article 13 any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, upon, over, along or across the street may where reasonably necessary for the efficient operation of the undertaking of the statutory utility or, if reasonably requested to do so by the Authority, must—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in that other position.
(3) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the Authority must pay to any statutory utility an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the statutory utility in or in connection with—
(a)
the execution of relocation works required in consequence of the stopping up of the street; and
(b)
the doing of any other work or thing rendered necessary by the execution of relocation works.
(4) If in the course of the execution of relocation works under sub-paragraph (2)—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimension is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the Authority, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this paragraph would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) will be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(5) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(6) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a statutory utility in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (3) (and having regard, where relevant, to sub-paragraph (4)) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the statutory utility any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(7) Sub-paragraph (6) does not apply to apparatus being substituted which comprises cathode protected steel mains and any other apparatus which is agreed between the Authority and the statutory utility as not being required to be replaced imminently.
(8) Sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) do not apply where—
(a)
the authorised works constitute major transport works or major highway works for the purposes of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act (including that Part as applied by article 5 (application of the 1991 Act)); and
(b)
any relocation works carried out under paragraph (2) include replacement apparatus being placed in a street,
but instead—
(i)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of costs of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section; and
(ii)
the allowable costs are to be borne by the Authority and the statutory utility in such proportions as may be prescribed by any such regulations.
(9) In this paragraph—
“apparatus” has the same meaning as in Part 3 of the 1991 Act;
“relocation works” means works executed, or apparatus provided, under sub-paragraph (2); and
“statutory utility” means a statutory undertaker for the purposes of the 1980 Act or an operator of an electronic communications code network as defined in paragraph 1(6).

3.—(1) Part 6 of the electronic communications code does not apply for the purposes of the authorised works to the extent that such works are regulated by Part 11 of the 1990 Act, sections 84 and 85 of the 1991 Act (or regulations made under section 85 of that Act), paragraph 2 or sub-paragraph (3).
(2) Part 10 of the electronic communications code applies for the purposes of the authorised works, except—
(a)
in so far as such works are regulated by the 1991 Act or any regulation made under that Act; or
(b)
where the Authority exercises a right under subsection (4)(b) of section 272 of the 1990 Act or under an order made under that section to remove apparatus.
(3) The temporary stopping up, alteration or diversion of any highway under article 14 (temporary stopping up of streets) does not affect any the code rights of an operator of an electronic communications code network in respect of any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion is in the highway.
(4) In this paragraph—
“apparatus” has the same meaning as in Part 3 of the 1991 Act;
“code rights” means those rights set out in paragraph 3 of the electronic communications code; and

The Authority must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Network Rail unless it has first consulted Network Rail and it must comply with Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.
14.  Any additional expenses which Network Rail may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the Authority, be repaid by the Authority to Network Rail.
15.—(1) The Authority must pay to Network Rail all reasonable costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Schedule which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)
by reason of the construction or maintenance of a specified work or the failure of such a work; or
(b)
by reason of any act or omission of the Authority or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged upon a specified work,
and the Authority must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or any such failure, act or omission: and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the Authority or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under his supervision does not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the Authority from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Network Rail must give the Authority reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand is to be made without the prior consent of the Authority.
(3) The sums payable by the Authority under sub-paragraph (1) include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs.
(4) Subject to the terms of any agreement between Network Rail and a train operator regarding the timing or method of payment of the relevant costs in respect of that train operator, Network Rail must promptly pay to each train operator the amount of any sums which Network Rail receives under sub-paragraph (3) which relates to the relevant costs of that train operator.
(5) The obligation under sub-paragraph (3) to pay Network Rail the relevant costs is, in the event of default, enforceable directly by any train operator concerned to the extent that such sums are payable to that operator under sub-paragraph (4).
(6) In this paragraph—
“the relevant costs” means the costs, direct losses and expenses (including loss of revenue) reasonably incurred by each train operator as a consequence of any restriction of the use of Network Rail’s railway network as a result of the construction, maintenance or failure of a specified work or any such act or omission as mentioned in subparagraph (1); and

17.  In the assessment of any sums payable to Network Rail under this Schedule no account is to be taken of any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken by or any agreement entered into by Network Rail if that action or agreement was not reasonably necessary and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the Authority under this Schedule or increasing the sums so payable.
18.  The Authority and Network Rail may, subject in the case of Network Rail to compliance with the terms of its network licence, enter into, and carry into effect, agreements for the transfer to the Authority of—
(a)
any railway property shown on the works and land plans and described in the book of reference;

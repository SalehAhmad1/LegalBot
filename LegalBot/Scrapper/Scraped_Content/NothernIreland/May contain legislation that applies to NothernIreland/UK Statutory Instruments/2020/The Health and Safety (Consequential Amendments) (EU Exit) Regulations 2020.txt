(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make consequential provision in exercise of the power in section 41(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1) (“the 2020 Act”). The Regulations amend the Health and Safety (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1370) (“the 2018 Regulations”) (which amend subordinate legislation in the field of health and safety), and substitute a number of references to “exit day” in those regulations with “IP completion day”.
The 2018 Regulations come into force on IP completion day by operation of paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the 2020 Act; the amendments made to the 2018 Regulations by these Regulations come into force immediately before IP completion day.

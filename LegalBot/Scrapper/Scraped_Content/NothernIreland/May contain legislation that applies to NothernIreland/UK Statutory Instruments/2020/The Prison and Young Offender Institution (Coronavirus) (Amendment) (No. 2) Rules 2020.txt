Sch. 2 para. 15 omitted (26.1.2022) by virtue of The Prison and Young Offender Institution (Coronavirus) (Amendment) Rules 2022 (S.I. 2022/4), rules 1(1), 3(3)EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Prison Rules 1999 (S.I. 1999/728) (“the 1999 Rules”) and the Young Offender Institution Rules 2000 (S.I. 2000/3371) (“the 2000 Rules”). The amendments are in response to the effect of the coronavirus pandemic in prisons and young offender institutions and apply during a coronavirus period.
Rules 2 and 3 provide that rule 9A of the 1999 Rules and rule 5A of the 2000 Rules cease to have effect on 25th March 2022.
Schedule 1 makes temporary modifications to the 1999 Rules to have effect until 25th March 2022. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 inserts new definitions into the 1999 Rules and defines a “coronavirus period”.
Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 inserts a new rule 2A into the 1999 Rules to provide the period of time of a “transition period”. The transition period is for 3 months and the Secretary of State may extend for subsequent periods of up to 1 month up to a total of 3 months.
Paragraphs 4 to 6 and 8 of Schedule 1 modifies various rules in the 1999 Rules to provide greater flexibility to comply with the requirements in the rule during a coronavirus period.
Paragraph 7 of Schedule 1 modifies rule 35 of the 1999 Rules to allow the Secretary of State to suspend a prisoner's statutory entitlement to visits under rule 35 where necessary as a result of effects arising from coronavirus.
Paragraphs 9 and 10 of Schedule 1 modify rules 53 and 53A to make amendments to reflect new rule 53B of the 1999 Rules.
Paragraph 11 of Schedule 1 inserts a new rule 53B into the 1999 Rules. This provides that, when a charge has been referred to an adjudicator, the Chief Magistrate may determine that it is not reasonably practicable for the adjudicator to inquire into a charge due to circumstances arising from coronavirus and the governor may inquire into that charge. The governor has 14 days to first inquire into a charge from the Chief Magistrate's decision. The charge is to be treated as a charge inquired into by a governor and cannot be subject to adjudicator's punishments in rule 55A. Paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 provides that a governor can determine that a charge is so serious that it must still be referred to an adjudicator.
Paragraph 12 of Schedule 1 modifies rule 73 of the 1999 Rules to allow the Secretary of State to prohibit visits by all persons, or classes of persons, to a prison if considered necessary as a result of the effects of coronavirus.
Paragraph 13 of Schedule 1 modifies rule 82 of the 1999 Rules to include new rule 53B of the 1999 Rules.
Schedule 2 makes equivalent modifications to the 2000 Rules.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

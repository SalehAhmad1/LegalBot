(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation) of the 1965 Act substitute—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.

(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),

(5) Section 11 M3 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to compulsory acquisition under article 24 (compulsory acquisition of land), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A M4 (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B M5 (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on a specified date), 12 M6 (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13 M7 (entry on warrant in the event of obstruction) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 M8 (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act, as modified by article 30(2) (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.  This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 (execution of declaration) of the 1981 Act as applied by article 31 (application of the 1981 Act) of the West Midlands Rail Freight Interchange Order 2020 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.

3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)

6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the use to be made of the right proposed to be acquired, and
(c)

12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.

(3) If by the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which written notice was served upon the engineer under sub-paragraph (2), Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct any part of a specified work which in the opinion of the engineer will or may affect the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker desires such part of the specified work to be constructed, Network Rail must construct it without unnecessary delay on behalf of and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to be approved or settled under this paragraph, and under the supervision (where appropriate and if given) of the undertaker.
(4) When signifying his approval of the plans the engineer may specify any protective works (whether temporary or permanent) which in his opinion should be carried out before the commencement of the construction of a specified work to ensure the safety or stability of railway property or the continuation of safe and efficient operation of the railways of Network Rail or the services of operators using the same (including any relocation, de-commissioning and removal of works, apparatus and equipment necessitated by a specified work and the comfort and safety of passengers who may be affected by the specified works), and such protective works as may be reasonably necessary for those purposes must be constructed by Network Rail or by the undertaker, if Network Rail so desires, and such protective works must be carried out at the expense of the undertaker in either case without unnecessary delay and the undertaker must not commence the construction of the specified works until the engineer has notified the undertaker that the protective works have been completed to his reasonable satisfaction.
6.—(1) Any specified work and any protective works to be constructed by virtue of paragraph 5(4) of this Part of this Schedule must, when commenced, be constructed—
(a)
without unnecessary delay in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to have been approved or settled under paragraph 5;
(b)
under the supervision (where appropriate and if given) and to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer;

(d)
so far as is reasonably practicable, so as not to interfere with or obstruct the free, uninterrupted and safe use of any railway of Network Rail or the traffic thereon and the use by passengers of railway property.
(2) If any damage to railway property or any such interference or obstruction is caused by the carrying out of, or in consequence of the construction of a specified work, the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval, make good such damage and must pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may sustain by reason of any such damage, interference or obstruction.
(3) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of Network Rail or its servants, contractors or agents or any liability on Network Rail with respect of any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of the undertaker or its servants, contractors or agents.

9.—(1) If any permanent or temporary alterations or additions to railway property, are reasonably necessary in consequence of the construction of a specified work, or during a period of 24 months after the completion of that work in order to ensure the safety of railway property or the continued safe operation of the railway of Network Rail, such alterations and additions may be carried out by Network Rail and if Network Rail gives to the undertaker reasonable notice of its intention to carry out such alterations or additions (which must be specified in the notice), the undertaker must pay to Network Rail the reasonable cost of those alterations or additions including, in respect of any such alterations and additions as are to be permanent, a capitalised sum representing the increase of the costs which may be expected to be reasonably incurred by Network Rail in maintaining, working and, when necessary, renewing any such alterations or additions.
(2) If during the construction of a specified work by the undertaker, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct that part of the specified work which in the opinion of the engineer is endangering the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker decides that part of the specified work is to be constructed, Network Rail must assume construction of that part of the specified work and the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval of a specified work under paragraph 5(3) of this Part of this Schedule, pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may suffer by reason of the execution by Network Rail of that specified work.
(3) The engineer must, in respect of the capitalised sums referred to in this paragraph and paragraph 10(a) of this Part of this Schedule provide such details of the formula by which those sums have been calculated as the undertaker may reasonably require.

10.  The undertaker must repay to Network Rail all reasonable fees, costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)
in constructing any part of a specified work on behalf of the undertaker as provided by paragraph 5(3) of this Part of this Schedule or in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 5(4) of this Part of this Schedule including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signalmen, watchmen and other persons whom it is reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may, in the opinion of the engineer, require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or from the substitution or diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work.
11.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail's apparatus; and
“Network Rail's apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised development) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail's apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 5(1) of this Part of this Schedule for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker's compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail's apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 5(1) of this Part of this Schedule) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail's apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail's apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail's apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail's apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 5(1) of this Part of this Schedule has effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) If at any time prior to the commencement of regular revenue-earning operations comprised in the authorised development and notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing or commissioning of the authorised development causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker's apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail's apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker's apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail's apparatus in the investigation of such EMI; and
(c)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail's apparatus or such EMI.
(8) Where Network Rail approves modifications to Network Rail's apparatus pursuant to sub-paragraphs (5) or (6)—
(a)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail's apparatus; and
(b)
such modifications must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 6 of this Part of this Schedule.

(3) If, for the purpose of executing any works, the undertaker requires to remove or divert any apparatus placed within the Order land, and alternative apparatus or any part of such alternative apparatus is to be constructed in land other than the Order land as a consequence of the removal or diversion of apparatus, then the undertaker must use reasonable endeavours to obtain alternative facilities and rights in other land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Should the undertaker not be able to obtain the alternative rights required under sub-paragraph (3) then the undertaker and WPD must use reasonable endeavours to agree a reasonably practicable and mutually agreeable alternative engineering solution which does not require alternative apparatus to be constructed in land other than Order land and does not require alternative rights.
(5) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker and the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (3) and an alternative engineering solution cannot be agreed in accordance with sub-paragraph (4), WPD must on receipt of written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to a requirement on WPD to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless WPD elects to do so.
(6) Any alternative apparatus required pursuant to sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between WPD and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled in accordance with paragraph 10 of this Part of this Schedule.
(7) WPD must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled pursuant to paragraph 10 of this Part of this Schedule, and after the grant to WPD of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(8) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (7), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to WPD that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by WPD, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of WPD.
(9) Nothing in sub-paragraph (8) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 600 millimetres of the apparatus.
6.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to WPD facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and WPD or in default of agreement settled in accordance with paragraph 10 of this Part of this Schedule.
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in the land of the undertaker, the expert must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised development and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the undertaker; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in the land for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the expert less favourable on the whole to WPD than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the expert must make provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to WPD as appears to the expert to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
7.—(1) Not less than 60 days before the undertaker intends to start the execution of any specified work, the undertaker must submit to WPD a plan, section and description of the works to be executed. Any submission must note the time limits imposed on WPD under sub-paragraph (3).
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) the undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (1) applies until WPD has given written approval of the submitted plan, and identified any reasonable requirements it has in relation to the carrying out of the works, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(3) If by the expiry of 60 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted WPD has not advised the undertaker in writing of its approval or disapproval of the plans and any reasonable requirements for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, it is deemed to have approved the plans, sections or descriptions as submitted.
(4) The works referred to in sub-paragraph (1) must be executed in accordance with the plan, section and description approved under sub-paragraph (3) and in accordance with any reasonable requirements as may be notified in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) by WPD, and WPD is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(5) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order the undertaker must comply with WPD's “Avoidance of Danger from Electricity Overhead Lines and Underground Cables” (2014), the Energy Network Association's “A Guide to the Safe Use of Mechanical Plant in the Vicinity of Electricity Overhead Lines” (undated), the Health and Safety Executive's GS6 “Avoiding Danger from Overhead Power Lines” and the Health and Safety Executive's “HSG47 Avoiding Danger from Underground Services” (3rd edition, 2014) as the same may be replaced from time to time.
(6) If in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, WPD reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement in accordance with sub-paragraph (2), the provisions of this paragraphs apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 5(2) of this Part of this Schedule.
(7) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 60 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(8) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to WPD notice as soon as is reasonably practicable, submit a plan, section and description of those works to WPD as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and comply with sub-paragraph (4) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
8.  The undertaker must repay to WPD the reasonable expenses incurred by WPD in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new connection arising as a result of the powers conferred upon the undertaker pursuant to this Order.
9.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any specified work, any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of WPD, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods by, WPD, the undertaker is to—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by WPD in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to WPD for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by WPD, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (l) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of WPD, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) WPD must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, is to have the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Expert determination
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (7), article 47 (arbitration) does not apply to this Part of this Schedule.
(2) Any difference under this Part of this Schedule must be referred to and settled by a single independent and suitable person who holds appropriate professional qualifications and is a member of a professional body relevant to the matter in dispute acting as an expert, such person to be agreed by the differing parties or, in the absence of agreement, identified by the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
(3) All parties involved in settling any difference must use best endeavours to do so within 21 days from the date of a dispute first being notified in writing by one party to the other and in the absence of the difference being settled within that period the expert must be appointed within 28 days of the notification of the dispute.
(4) The fees of the expert are payable by the parties in such proportions as the expert may determine or, in the absence of such determination, equally.

Capitalised sums
24.  Any capitalised sum which is required to be paid under this Part of this Schedule must be calculated by multiplying the cost of the maintenance or renewal works to the waterway necessitated as a result of the operation of the authorised development by the number of times that the maintenance or renewal works will be required during the operation of the authorised development.

5.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference, the undertaker may not acquire any land interest or apparatus or acquire, extinguish, interfere with or otherwise override any easement and/or other interest or right of Cadent otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker) that are subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of Cadent or affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Cadent and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as Cadent reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent unless otherwise agreed by Cadent, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure or secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works.
(3) Where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus (including the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by Cadent or other enactments relied upon by Cadent as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Part of this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by Cadent under paragraph 8, or any other paragraph, of this Part of this Schedule, is not be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Part of this Schedule or in any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of Cadent to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of Cadent in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Cadent advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Cadent reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Cadent to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 8(1) of this Part of this Schedule) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed, with the undertaker's assistance if required by Cadent, save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for Cadent to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 14 of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator is to make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection
8.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to Cadent a plan and, if reasonably required by Cadent, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—

(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (1) applies until Cadent has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of Cadent required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (5) or (7); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraph (1) applies, Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (5), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) or (7) by Cadent for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Cadent will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent's satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required and the Cadent must give 56 days' notice of such works from the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(8) If Cadent in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) or (7) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) and (6) to (8) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2) of this Part of this Schedule.
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must—
(a)
comply with sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
comply with sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(11) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order the undertaker must comply with the Cadent policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “Specification for safe working in the vicinity of National Grid, High pressure Gas pipelines and associated installation requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22” and HSE's “HS(~G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
(12) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 9 of this Part of this Schedule.
Expenses
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Cadent on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by Cadent in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 6(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Cadent becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workmanlike manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any authorised works and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by Cadent as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 (benefit of order granting development consent ) of the 2008 Act subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this paragraph (b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 10.
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third-party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
Enactments and agreements
11.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between Cadent and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Cadent and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Cadent on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
12.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or Cadent requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 6(2) of this part of this Schedule Cadent makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 8 of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Cadent's undertaking and Cadent must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) Whenever Cadent's consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
13.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 5(1) of this Part of this Schedule or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable Cadent to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration

On street apparatus
3.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus in stopped up streets
4.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 10 (permanent stopping up of streets), any utility undertaker whose apparatus is in the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to the utility undertaker legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the utility undertaker in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of the utility undertaker to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 6 of this Part of this Schedule or the power of the undertaker to carry out works under paragraph 8 of this Part of this Schedule.

Acquisition of land
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker's apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed, diverted or otherwise altered under this Part of this Schedule, and/or any right of a utility undertaker to maintain apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, or made incapable of being exercised unless—
(a)
it is in the reasonable opinion of the undertaker necessary for the purpose of carrying out the authorised development;

any rights required by the utility undertaker (acting reasonably) including to install, access, retain, replace, divert, relocate and maintain any apparatus or alternative apparatus have been granted to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker; and
(d)
any of the apparatus or alternative apparatus referred to in paragraph (b) or rights required and referred to in paragraph (c) do not in the reasonable opinion of the utility undertaker cause a material increase in the time, resources of and costs to the utility undertaker in using, operating or maintaining its apparatus unless agreed otherwise by the utility undertaker.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal, diversion or alteration of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days' written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus, and the utility undertaker may elect to leave in situ any apparatus that the undertaker requires to be removed provided that it permits the undertaker to remove the apparatus and at its own cost in place of the utility undertaker.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed the utility undertaker must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47, and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), and in accordance with a timetable to be agreed with the undertaker (both parties acting reasonably) such timetable to have due and proper regard to the utility undertaker's statutory obligations with regard to its apparatus and undertaking including its obligation to maintain the supply of clean water at all times, proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and, subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph, subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection of disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is lain in a trench) within 300 millimetres of apparatus which is not being removed, diverted or altered without the consent of the utility undertaker (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 47 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus

(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan section and description for approval of the utility undertaker (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and in any event within 17 working days) instead of the plan, section or description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and it must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and it must not under any circumstances interfere with the apparatus of the utility undertaker or do anything that would interfere with or prevent the use of that apparatus without the express permission of the utility undertaker.

(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan, specification or description approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

25th November 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8C of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16). The Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of air quality to make amendments necessary to recognise the Northern Ireland Protocol as part of the EU Withdrawal Agreement.
These Regulations are made in substantially the same form as the Air Quality (Amendment) (Northern Ireland Protocol) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, which were revoked shortly after they were made by the Air Quality (Amendment) (Northern Ireland Protocol) (EU Exit) (Revocation) Regulations 2020 (the accompanying explanatory memorandum to that instrument explains the reason for that revocation).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is available alongside the instrument on the UK legislation website, www.legislation.gov.uk.

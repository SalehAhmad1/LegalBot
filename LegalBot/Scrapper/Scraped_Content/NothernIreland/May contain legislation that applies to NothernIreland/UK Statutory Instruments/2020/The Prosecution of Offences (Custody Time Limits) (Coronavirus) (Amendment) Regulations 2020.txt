(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Prosecution of Offences (Custody Time Limits) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/299) (“the 1987 Regulations”) to provide for an increase in custody time limits in relation to those awaiting trial in the Crown Court. The amendments are in response to the effect of the coronavirus pandemic in relation to jury trials.
Regulation 2 amends the custody time limits provided by regulation 5 of the 1987 Regulations in respect of those awaiting trial in the Crown Court.
Regulation 3(1) disapplies the amendments made by regulation 2 in respect of those in custody and subject to a custody time limit provided in regulation 5 of the 1987 Regulations prior to the commencement of these Regulations. In addition, regulation 3(2) provides for the new time limits in regulation 2 to continue to apply where an accused is in custody for the first time following the commencement of these Regulations but before the expiry of the Regulations, where the applicable time limit expires after these Regulations cease to have effect.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

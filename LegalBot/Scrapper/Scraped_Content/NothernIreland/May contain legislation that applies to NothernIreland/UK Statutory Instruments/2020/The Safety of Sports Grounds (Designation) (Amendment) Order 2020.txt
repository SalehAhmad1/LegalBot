14th January 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This is not part of the Order)
By section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (c. 52) the Secretary of State may designate as a sports ground requiring a safety certificate under that Act any sports ground which, in the Secretary of State’s opinion, has accommodation for more than the specified number of spectators.
By the Safety of Sports Grounds (Accommodation of Spectators) Order 1996 (S.I. 1996/499), the specified number of spectators is 5,000 in respect of those sports grounds in England and Wales at which association football matches are played and which are occupied by a club that is a member of the Football League Limited or the Football Association Premier League Limited. Sports grounds meeting these conditions may be designated under article 2(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/661) (“the 2015 Order”). The specified number of spectators in all other cases is 10,000; those sports grounds are designated under article 2(1) of the 2015 Order.
This Order amends the 2015 Order as it designates The Peninsula Stadium, occupied by Salford City Football Club, under article 2(2) of the 2015 Order, as a sports ground for which a safety certificate is required under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
It also amends the designation in the 2015 Order of the sports ground at Gigg Lane which is occupied by Bury Football Club, as that club is no longer a member of the Football League Limited or the Football Association Premier League Limited. By virtue of this Order, that sports ground is now designated under article 2(1), instead of article 2(2), of the 2015 Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or significant, impact on private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

Foreign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
The Regulations make corrections and amendments to a number of sanctions regulations which have been made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act, namely the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/411), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/433), the South Sudan (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/438), the Iran (Sanctions) (Nuclear) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/461), the ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida (United Nations Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/466), the Counter-Terrorism (International Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/573), the Counter-Terrorism (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/577), the Lebanon (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/612), the Central African Republic (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations (S.I. 2020/616), the Lebanon (Sanctions) (Assassination of Rafiq Hariri and others) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/617) and the Somalia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/642).
The main amendments made by this instrument are to introduce a new exception into these regimes to provide that a prohibition or requirement is not contravened if conduct is authorised by a licence or other authorisation issued under the law as it applies in a British Overseas Territory or Crown Dependency.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations, as the instrument is intended to ensure existing sanctions remain in place following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. An impact assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions Act and can be found at:

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides for the establishment, on 1st April 2021, of a single tier of local government in Northamptonshire. Two new councils are created; the North Northamptonshire Council, for the same area as the existing districts of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering and Wellingborough, and the West Northamptonshire Council, for the same area as the existing districts of Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire.
The County of Northamptonshire and the districts of Corby, East Northamptonshire, Kettering, Wellingborough, Daventry, Northampton and South Northamptonshire are abolished as local government areas with effect from 1st April 2021. The county council and district councils in the county are wound up.
The new councils, to which elections are to be held in 2020, will operate as “shadow authorities” until 1st April 2021. Part 3 of the Order contains the arrangements for the shadow authorities, including their functions which are principally to prepare for the transition to a single tier of local government on 1st April 2021.
Part 4 of the Order deals with electoral matters. Elections for the new councils will take place on the ordinary day of elections in 2020, 2025 and every fourth year thereafter. Elections for parish councillors in Northamptonshire will take place on the same day as elections to the new councils and follow the same cycle.
Part 5 of the Order deals with further transitional duties including duties on the county council and existing district councils, in particular to cooperate with each other and the shadow authorities and shadow executives and to create joint committees.
The Schedule sets out the electoral wards of North Northamptonshire Council and West Northamptonshire Council.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument will have no impact on the costs of business and the voluntary sector. The impact on the public sector is a simplification to the system of local government in Northamptonshire.

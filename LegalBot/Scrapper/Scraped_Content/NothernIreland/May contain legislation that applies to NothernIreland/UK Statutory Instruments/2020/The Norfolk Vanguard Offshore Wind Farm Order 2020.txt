10.  On a referral under paragraph 7 the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the proposed use of the right, and
(c)
if the right is proposed to be acquired for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10 it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the undertaker ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the undertaker ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the undertaker withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

(4) The undertaker must inform the MMO of the location and quantities of material disposed of each month under this licence. This information must be submitted to the MMO by 15 February each year for the months August to January inclusive, and by 15 August each year for the months February to July inclusive.
(5) The undertaker must ensure that only inert material of natural origin, produced during the drilling installation of or seabed preparation for foundations, and drilling mud is disposed of within disposal site references HU213, HU214, HU215 and HU216 within the extent of the Order limits seaward of MHWS. Any other materials must be screened out before disposal of the inert material at this site.
(6) The undertaker must ensure that any rock material used in the construction of the authorised scheme is from a recognised source, free from contaminants and containing minimal fines.
(7) In the event that any rock material used in the construction of the authorised scheme is misplaced or lost below MHWS, the undertaker must report the loss to the District Marine Office within 48 hours and if the MMO reasonably considers such material to constitute a navigation or environmental hazard (dependent on the size and nature of the material) the undertaker must endeavour to locate the material and recover it.
(8) The undertaker must undertake the survey agreed under condition 9(1)(h)(iii) following the swath-bathymetry survey referred to in condition 15(2)(b). Should any such obstructions resulting from burial of Work No. 4A or 4B (export cables and fibre optic cables) be identified which, in the reasonable opinion of the MMO, may be considered to interfere with fishing, the undertaker must take such steps to remove them as the MMO in its reasonable opinion may require.
(9) The undertaker must ensure that no waste concrete slurry or wash water from concrete or cement works are discharged into the marine environment. Concrete and cement mixing and washing areas should be contained to prevent run off entering the water through the freeing ports.
(10) The undertaker must ensure that any oil, fuel or chemical spill within the marine environment is reported to the MMO, Marine Pollution Response Team in accordance with the marine pollution contingency plan agreed under condition 14(1)(d)(i).
(11) All dropped objects must be reported to the MMO using the Dropped Object Procedure Form as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 24 hours of the undertaker becoming aware of an incident. On receipt of the Dropped Object Procedure Form, the MMO may require relevant surveys to be carried out by the undertaker (such as side scan sonar) if reasonable to do so and the MMO may require obstructions to be removed from the seabed at the undertaker’s expense if reasonable to do so.

Sch. 14 para. 3 in force at 22.7.2020, see art. 1
Procedure
4.—(1) The parties’ pleadings, witness statements and expert reports (if any) must be concise. No single pleading is to exceed 30 single-sided A4 pages using 10pt Arial font.
(2) The Arbitrator must make an award on the substantive difference(s) based solely on the written material submitted by the parties unless the Arbitrator decides that a hearing is necessary to explain or resolve any matters.
(3) Either party may, within 2 days of delivery of the last submission, request a hearing giving specific reasons why it considers a hearing is required.
(4) Within 7 days of receiving the last submission, the Arbitrator must notify the parties whether a hearing is to be held and the length of that hearing.
(5) Within 10 days of the Arbitrator advising the parties that he is to hold a hearing, the date and venue for the hearing must be fixed by agreement with the parties, save that if there is no agreement the Arbitrator must direct a date and venue which he considers is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. The date for the hearing must not be less than 35 days from the date of the Arbitrator’s direction confirming the date and venue of the hearing.
(6) A decision must be made by the Arbitrator on whether there is any need for expert evidence to be submitted orally at the hearing. If oral expert evidence is required by the Arbitrator, then any expert(s) attending the hearing may be asked questions by the Arbitrator.
(7) There is no process of examination and cross-examination of experts, but the Arbitrator must invite the parties to ask questions of the experts by way of clarification of any answers given by the expert(s) in response to the Arbitrator’s questions. Prior to the hearing the procedure for the expert(s) is:
(a)
at least 28 days before a hearing, the Arbitrator must provide a list of issues to be addressed by the expert(s);
(b)
if more than one expert is called, they are to jointly confer and produce a joint report or reports within 14 days of the issues being provided; and
(c)
the form and content of a joint report must be as directed by the Arbitrator and must be provided at least 7 days before the hearing.
(8) Within 14 days of a Hearing or a decision by the Arbitrator that no hearing is to be held the Parties may by way of exchange provide the Arbitrator with a final submission in connection with the matters in dispute and any submissions on costs. The Arbitrator must take these submissions into account in the Award.
(9) The Arbitrator may make other directions or rulings as considered appropriate in order to ensure that the parties comply with the timetable and procedures to achieve an award on the substantive difference within 4 months of the date on which they are appointed, unless both parties otherwise agree to an extension to the date for the award.
(10) If a party fails to comply with the timetable, procedure or any other direction then the Arbitrator may continue in the absence of a party or submission or document, and may make a decision on the information before them attaching the appropriate weight to any evidence submitted beyond any timetable or in breach of any procedure and/or direction.
(11) The Arbitrator’s award must include reasons. The parties must accept that the extent to which reasons are given are proportionate to the issues in dispute and the time available to the Arbitrator to deliver the award.

Arbitrator’s powers
5.—(1) The Arbitrator has all the powers of the Arbitration Act 1996(1), including the non-mandatory sections, save where modified by these Rules.
(2) There must be no discovery or disclosure, except that the Arbitrator has the power to order the parties to produce such documents as are reasonably requested by another party no later than the Statement of Reply, or by the Arbitrator, where the documents are manifestly relevant, specifically identified and the burden of production is not excessive. Any application and orders are to be made by way of a Redfern Schedule without any hearing.
(3) Any time limits fixed in accordance with this procedure or by the Arbitrator may be varied by agreement between the parties, subject to any such variation being acceptable to and approved by the Arbitrator. In the absence of agreement, the Arbitrator may vary the timescales and/or procedure:
(a)
if the Arbitrator is satisfied that a variation of any fixed time limit is reasonably necessary to avoid a breach of the rules of natural justice and then;
(b)
only for such a period that is necessary to achieve fairness between the parties.
(4) On the date the award is made, the Arbitrator must notify the parties that the award is completed, signed and dated, and that it is to be issued to the parties on receipt of cleared funds for the Arbitrator’s fees and expenses.

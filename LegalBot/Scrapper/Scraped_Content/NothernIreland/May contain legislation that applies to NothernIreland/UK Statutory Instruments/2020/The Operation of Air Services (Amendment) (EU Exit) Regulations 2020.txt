(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(b) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 inserts new provisions into the Operation of Air Services (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1392) to fix further deficiencies in retained EU law which have arisen as a result of amendments made to Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 2008 on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community since the 2018 Regulations were made.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations and is available with these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

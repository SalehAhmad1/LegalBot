7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)

12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner's interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker shall pay to National Grid on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred or compensation properly paid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation in the event that National Grid elects to use compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph ;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works; and
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 35 (arbitration) of this Order to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph —
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to UKPN facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and UKPN or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 35 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to UKPN than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to UKPN as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.

8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph , the undertaker must submit to UKPN a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub–paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub–paragraph by UKPN for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and UKPN is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by UKPN under sub–paragraph must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If UKPN in accordance with sub–paragraph and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs and apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph .
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub–paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to UKPN notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub–paragraph in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.

9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to UKPN the reasonable expenses incurred by UKPN in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub–paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 35 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to UKPN by virtue of sub–paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub–paragraph —
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to UKPN in respect of works by virtue of sub–paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on UKPN any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.

(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by UKPN in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify UKPN for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from UKPN,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub–paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of UKPN, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) UKPN must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

(4) Within 7 days of receiving the last submission, the arbitrator will notify the parties whether a hearing is to be held and the length of that hearing.
(5) Within 10 days of the arbitrator advising the parties that he/she will hold a hearing, the date and venue for the hearing will be fixed by agreement with the parties, save that if there is no agreement the arbitrator is to direct a date and venue which he/she considers is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances.

(9) The arbitrator may make other directions or rulings as considered appropriate in order to ensure that the parties comply with the timetable and procedures to achieve an award on the substantive difference within 4 months of the date on which he/she is appointed, unless both parties otherwise agree to an extension to the date for the award.
(10) If a party fails to comply with the timetable, procedure or any other direction then the arbitrator may continue in the absence of a party or submission or document, and may make a decision on the information before him/her attaching the appropriate weight to any evidence submitted beyond any timetable or in breach of any procedure and/or direction.
(11) The arbitrator's award must include reasons. The parties must accept that the extent to which reasons are given must be proportionate to the issues in dispute and the time available to the arbitrator to deliver the award.

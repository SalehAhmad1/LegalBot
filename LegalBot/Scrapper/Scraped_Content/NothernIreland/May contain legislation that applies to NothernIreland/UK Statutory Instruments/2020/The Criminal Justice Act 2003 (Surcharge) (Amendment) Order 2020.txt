16th March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 161A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44) requires a court, when dealing with a person for one or more offences, to order that person to pay a surcharge. The amount of the surcharge that is payable in particular circumstances is set out in the Schedule to the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (Surcharge) Order 2012 (S.I. 2012/1696) (“the 2012 Order”). Article 2 of this Order substitutes the Schedule to the 2012 Order to provide for an increase in those amounts.
Article 3 provides that the increased amounts do not apply where a court deals with a person for a single offence committed before the date on which this Order comes into force, or where it deals with a person for more than one offence and at least one of those offences was committed before that date.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

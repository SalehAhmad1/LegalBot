14th April 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules further amend the Land Registration Rules 2003 (S.I. 2003/1417) (the principal Rules). The principal Rules make detailed provision for land registration in England and Wales under powers contained in the Land Registration Act 2002 (c. 9). These Rules amend the principal Rules to allow for the Chief Land Registrar to certify a day as an “interrupted working day”. The effect of this is to extend the expiry date of the priority period given by an official search, and the date for responses to notices and requisitions, by the number of working days equal to the number of interrupted working days falling within the priority period or within the time given for responding to notices and requisitions.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

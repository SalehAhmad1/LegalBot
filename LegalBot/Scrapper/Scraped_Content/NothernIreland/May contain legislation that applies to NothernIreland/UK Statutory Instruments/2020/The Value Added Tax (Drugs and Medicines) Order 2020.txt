9th March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order inserts ‘an EEA country health professional’ and ‘an approved country health professional’ into the definition of ‘appropriate practitioner’ in Note (2B) to item 1 of Group 12 of Schedule 8 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994.
The effect is that supplies by registered pharmacists of items prescribed by appropriately qualified health professionals practising in a country outside the UK as defined by regulation 213 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/1916) are subject to a zero-rate of Value Added Tax.
Regulation 213 of the Human Medicines Regulations will be amended on IP completion day by regulation 179 of the Human Medicines (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/775) with the effect that the definition ‘an EEA health professional’ will be replaced by the definition ‘approved country health professional’. Article 1 of this Order accordingly makes provision to ensure that the Value Added Tax Act is amended to reflect the change to the Human Medicines Regulations.
The amendments made to the Human Medicines Regulations on IP completion day will also include the insertion of a new regulation 214(6A) which refers to a list of approved countries and professions for the purpose of the definition of ‘approved country health professional’. The list is available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prescriptions-issued-in-the-eea-and-switzerland-guidance-for-pharmacists. Free of charge hard copies will be available on request from the HMRC helpline on 0300 200 3700 (+44 2920 501 261 for outside the UK enquiries) or by writing to HM Revenue and Customs - VAT Written Enquiries Team, Portcullis House, 21 India Street, Glasgow, G2 4PZ, United Kingdom.

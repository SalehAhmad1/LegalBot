19th May 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations commence provisions of the Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Act 2019 (c.7) (“the 2019 Act”) so far as they are not already in force. These are the third commencement regulations made under the 2019 Act. Section 3 came into force on the passing of the 2019 Act.
Regulation 2 brings into force sections 1 and 2 of the 2019 Act for all remaining purposes.
Section 1 of the 2019 Act amends section 3 (“appropriate consent”: adults) of the Human Tissue Act 2004 (c.30) (“the 2004 Act”) to set out when deemed consent amounts to appropriate consent for transplantation purposes. Section 1 of the 2019 Act also amends section 3 of the 2004 Act to provide a power for the Secretary of State to make regulations to specify organs, tissues and cells in relation to which deemed consent will not apply.
Section 2 of the 2019 Act makes consequential amendments to the 2004 Act, including amendments that allow for the storage and use, in Northern Ireland, of organs and tissues removed in England for the purposes of transplantation, even where there was deemed rather than express consent to the removal.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT REGULATIONS

29th September 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/661, “the 2015 Order”) so as to designate The Football Stadium, occupied by Harrogate Town Association Football Club, as a sports ground for which a safety certificate is required under the Sports Grounds Safety Act 1975 (c. 52, “the 1975 Act”).
As well as being occupied by a member of the Football League Limited, The Football Stadium is a sports ground in England and Wales at which association football matches are played and which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, has accommodation for more than 5,000 spectators.
The 2015 Order is also amended to reflect a change in the post code for Plough Lane, occupied by A. F. C. Wimbledon, and so that three sports grounds are no longer designated as sports grounds for which a safety certificate is required under the 1975 Act. These three grounds are the Hive Stadium (occupied by Barnet Football Club) and Moss Rose Stadium (occupied by Macclesfield Town Football Club) following the relegation of those clubs from the Football League, and Griffin Park (occupied by Brentford Football Club) as the club now plays its home games in another sports ground.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

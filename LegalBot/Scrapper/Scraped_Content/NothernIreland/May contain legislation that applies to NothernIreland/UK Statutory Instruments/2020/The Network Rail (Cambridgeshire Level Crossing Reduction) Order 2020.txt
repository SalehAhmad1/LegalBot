(2) Any street to be constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed between Network Rail and the highway authority, must be maintained by and at the expense of Network Rail for a period of 12 months from its completion and from the expiry of that period by and at the expense of the highway authority.

(4) Paragraphs (2) and (3) do not apply in relation to the structure of any bridge or tunnel carrying a street over or under any railway of Network Rail and except as provided in those paragraphs Network Rail is not liable to maintain the surface of any street under or over which the scheduled works are constructed, or the immediate approaches to any such street.
(5) In any action against Network Rail in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without affecting any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that Network Rail had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(6) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (5), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether Network Rail knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where Network Rail could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that Network Rail had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that Network Rail had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.
(7) Nothing in this article—
(a)
affects the operation of section 87 (prospectively maintainable highways) of the 1991 Act; and Network Rail is not, by reason of any duty under this article to maintain a street, to be taken to be a street authority in relation to that street for the purposes of Part 3 of that Act; or

(b)
with the approval of the highway authority, form and lay out such other means of access or improve existing means of access, at such locations within the Order limits as Network Rail reasonably requires for the purposes of the authorised works.
(2) If a highway authority fails to notify Network Rail of its decision within 28 days of receiving an application for approval under paragraph (1), that highway authority is deemed to have granted approval.Highways subject to redesignation
13.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this article, the highways specified in column (2) of Schedule 4 (redesignation of highways) shall, on completion of works, cease to be highways of the description specified on the definitive map and statement or in the list of streets as specified in column (3) and are designated as highways as described in column (4) of Schedule 4.

(6) A right to compensation under section 10 (further provision as to compensation for injurious affection) of the 1965 Act shall apply in respect of any land or any interest in land which has been injuriously affected by the stopping up and discontinuance of the level crossing referred to in paragraph (1) or by the cessation of public rights of access referred to in paragraph (5).

(9) In any action against Network Rail in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain the new highway, it is a defence (without affecting any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that Network Rail had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the new highway to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(10) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (9), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the new highway and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a highway of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the new highway;
(d)
whether Network Rail knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the new highway to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the new highway;
(e)
where Network Rail could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the new highway before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that Network Rail had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the new highway to which the action relates unless it is also proved that Network Rail had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the new highway and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.
(11) The new highways are to be treated as completed to the satisfaction of the highway authority for the purpose of paragraph (1) if it fails to reply to a request for certification that it is satisfied with the work within 28 days of receiving the request.
(12) Where any highway created under this article passes over a scheduled work, the highway extends to include the scheduled work.Discharge of water
17.—(1) Network Rail may use any watercourse or any public sewer or drain for the drainage of water in connection with the construction, operation or maintenance of the authorised works and for that purpose may lay down, take up and alter pipes and may, on any land within the Order limits, make openings into, and connections with, the watercourse, public sewer or drain.
(2) Any dispute arising from the making of connections to or the use of a public sewer or drain by Network Rail under paragraph (1) is to be determined as if it were a dispute under section 106 (right to communicate with public sewers) of the Water Industry Act 1991(1).
(3) Network Rail must not discharge any water into any watercourse, public sewer or drain except with the consent of the person to whom it belongs; and such consent may be given subject to such terms and conditions as that person may reasonably impose, but must not be unreasonably withheld.
(4) Network Rail must not make any opening into any public sewer or drain except—
(a)
in accordance with plans approved by the person to whom the sewer or drain belongs, but such approval must not be unreasonably withheld; and
(b)
where that person has been given the opportunity to supervise the making of the opening.
(5) Network Rail must not, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this article, damage or interfere with the bed or banks of any watercourse forming part of a main river.
(6) Network Rail must take such steps as are reasonably practicable to secure that any water discharged into a watercourse or public sewer or drain under the powers conferred by this article is as free as may be practicable from gravel, soil or other solid substance, oil or matter in suspension.
(7) Nothing in this article overrides the requirement for an environmental permit under regulation 12(1)(b) of the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016(2).
(8) If a person who receives an application for consent or approval fails to notify Network Rail of a decision within 28 days of receiving an application for consent under paragraph (3) or approval under paragraph (4)(a) that person is deemed to have granted consent or given approval, as the case may be.
(9) In this article—
(a)
“public sewer or drain” means a sewer or drain which belongs to a sewerage undertaker, the Environment Agency, an internal drainage board, or a local authority; and
(b)
other expressions, excluding watercourse, used both in this article and in the Water Resources Act 1991(3) have the same meaning as in that Act.

(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or
(b)
the land over which the right is, or is to be, exercisable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in the case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard shall be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right, but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land)—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure of owners to convey),
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity),
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners), and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are so modified as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be acquired compulsorily is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right as well as the notice required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 20(1)), it has power, exercisable in the same circumstances and subject to the same conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A(3)(powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on a specified date), 12(5) (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of that Act are modified accordingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such interests as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 20(7)) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.  This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over the whole or part of a house, building or factory.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of its decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the use to be made of the right proposed to be acquired, and
(c)
if the right is proposed to be acquired for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

“specified work” means a category 1 specified work or a category 2 specified work.
2.—(1) Before beginning to construct any specified work, Network Rail must submit to the drainage authority plans of the specified work and such further particulars available to it as the drainage authority may within 28 days of the receipt of the plans reasonably require.
(2) Any such specified work must not be constructed except in accordance with such plans as may be approved in writing by the drainage authority, or determined under paragraph 12.
(3) Any approval of the drainage authority required under this paragraph—
(a)
must not be unreasonably withheld;
(b)
is deemed to have been given if it is neither given nor refused within 2 months of the submission of the plans for approval and, in the case of a refusal, accompanied by a statement of the grounds of refusal; and
(c)
may be given subject to such reasonable requirements as the drainage authority may make for the protection of any drainage work, fishery, water resources, or for the prevention of flooding or pollution or in the discharge of its environmental duties.
(4) The drainage authority must use its reasonable endeavours to respond to the submission of any plans before the expiration of the period mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)(b).
3.  Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 2, the requirements which the drainage authority may make under that paragraph include conditions requiring Network Rail at its own expense to construct such protective works, whether temporary or permanent, before or during the construction of the specified works (including the provision of flood banks, walls or embankments or other new works and the strengthening, repair or renewal of existing banks, walls or embankments) as are reasonably necessary—
(a)
to safeguard any drainage work against damage; or
(b)
to secure that its efficiency for flood defence purposes is not impaired and that the risk of flooding is not otherwise increased,
by reason of any specified work.
4.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), any specified work, and all protective works required by the drainage authority under paragraph 3, must be constructed—
(a)
without unnecessary delay in accordance with the plans approved or settled under this Schedule; and
(b)

and an officer of the drainage authority is entitled to watch and inspect the construction of such works.
(2) Network Rail must give to the drainage authority not less than 14 days’ notice in writing of its intention to commence construction of any specified work and notice in writing of its completion not later than 7 days after the date on which it is completed.
(3) If any part of a specified work or any protective work required by the drainage authority is constructed otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of this Schedule, the drainage authority may by notice in writing require Network Rail at Network Rail’s own expense to comply with the requirements of this Schedule or (if Network Rail so elects and the drainage authority in writing consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to remove, alter or pull down the work and, where removal is required, to restore the site to its former condition to such extent and within such limits as the drainage authority reasonably requires.
(4) Subject to sub-paragraph (5) and paragraph 8, if within a reasonable period, being not less than 28 days from the date when a notice under sub-paragraph (3) is served upon Network Rail, it has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the requirements of the notice and subsequently to make reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the drainage authority may execute the works specified in the notice and any expenditure incurred by it in so doing is recoverable from Network Rail.
(5) In the event of any dispute as to whether sub-paragraph (3) is properly applicable to any work in respect of which notice has been served under that sub-paragraph, or as to the reasonableness of any requirement of such a notice, the drainage authority must not except in an emergency exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (4) until the dispute has been finally determined.
(6) If by reason of construction of the specified work the Agency’s access to flood defences or equipment maintained for flood defence purposes is materially obstructed, Network Rail must provide such alternative means of access to allow the Agency to maintain the flood defence or use the equipment no less effectively than before the obstruction.
5.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (5) Network Rail must from the commencement of the construction of the specified works maintain in good repair and condition and free from obstruction any drainage work which is situated within the limits of deviation and on land held by Network Rail for the purposes of or in connection with the specified works, whether or not the drainage work is constructed under the powers conferred by this Order or is already in existence.
(2) If any such drainage work which Network Rail is liable to maintain is not maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the drainage authority, the drainage authority may by notice in writing require Network Rail to repair and restore the work, or any part of such work, or (if Network Rail so elects and the drainage authority in writing consents, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to remove the work and restore the site to its former condition, to such extent and within such limits as the drainage authority reasonably requires.
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5) and paragraph 8, if, within a reasonable period being not less than 28 days beginning with the date on which a notice in respect of any drainage work is served under sub-paragraph (2) on Network Rail, Network Rail has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the reasonable requirements of the notice and has not subsequently made reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the drainage authority may do what is necessary for such compliance and may recover any expenditure reasonably incurred by it in so doing from Network Rail.
(4) In the event of any dispute as to the reasonableness of any requirement of a notice served under sub-paragraph (2), the drainage authority must not except in a case of an emergency exercise the powers conferred by sub-paragraph (3) until the dispute has been finally determined.
(5) This paragraph does not apply to—
(a)
drainage works which are vested in the drainage authority, or which the drainage authority or another person is liable to maintain and is not precluded by the powers of the Order from doing so; and
(b)
any obstruction of a drainage work for the purpose of a work or operation authorised by this Order and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
6.  Subject to paragraph 8, if by reason of the construction of any specified work or of the failure of any such work the efficiency of any drainage work for flood defence purposes is impaired, or that drainage work is otherwise damaged, such impairment or damage must be made good by Network Rail to the reasonable satisfaction of the drainage authority and if Network Rail fails to do so, the drainage authority may make good the same and recover from Network Rail the expense reasonably incurred by it in so doing.
7.—(1) Network Rail must take all such measures as may be reasonably practicable to prevent any interruption of the free passage of fish in the fishery during the construction of any specified work.
(2) If by reason of—
(a)
the construction of any specified work; or
(b)
the failure of any such work,
damage to a fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the drainage authority may serve notice on Network Rail requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage, or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.
(3) Subject to paragraph 8, if within such time as may be reasonably practicable for that purpose after the receipt of written notice from the Agency of any damage or expected damage to a fishery, Network Rail fails to take such steps as are described in sub-paragraph (2), the drainage authority may take those steps and may recover from Network Rail the expense reasonably incurred by it in doing so.
(4) Subject to paragraph 8, in any case where immediate action by the Agency is reasonably required in order to secure that the risk of damage to the fishery is avoided or reduced, the drainage authority may take such steps as are reasonable for the purpose, and may recover from Network Rail the reasonable cost of so doing provided that notice specifying those steps is served on Network Rail as soon as reasonably practicable after the Agency has taken, or commenced to take, the steps specified in the notice.
8.  Nothing in paragraphs 4(4), 5(3), 6, 7(3) and (4) authorises the drainage authority to execute works on or affecting an operational railway forming part of Network Rail’s network without the prior consent in writing of Network Rail such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
9.  Network Rail must indemnify the drainage authority in respect of all costs, charges and expenses which the drainage authority may reasonably incur or have to pay or which it may sustain—
(a)
in the examination or approval of plans under this Schedule;
(b)
in the inspection of the construction of the specified works or any protective works required by the drainage authority under this Schedule.
10.—(1) Without affecting the other provisions of this Schedule, Network Rail must indemnify the drainage authority from all claims, demands, proceedings, costs, charges, penalties, damages, expenses and losses, which may be made or taken against, recovered from, or incurred by, the drainage authority by reason of—
(a)
any damage to any drainage work so as to impair its efficiency for the purposes of flood defence;
(b)
any damage to the fishery;
(c)
any raising or lowering of the water table in land adjoining the authorised development or any sewers, drains and watercourses;
(d)
any flooding or increased flooding of any such lands, or
(e)
inadequate water quality in any watercourse or other surface waters or in any groundwater,
which is caused by the construction of any of the specified works or any act or omission of Network Rail, its contractors, agents or employees whilst engaged upon the work.
(2) The drainage authority must give to Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise may be made without the agreement of Network Rail which agreement must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
11.  The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done by Network Rail in accordance with plans approved by the drainage authority, or to the drainage authority’s satisfaction, or in accordance with any directions or award of an arbitrator, does not relieve Network Rail from any liability under the provisions of this Schedule.
12.  Any dispute arising between Network Rail and the drainage authority under this Schedule, if the parties agree, is to be determined by arbitration under article 39 (arbitration), but otherwise is to be determined by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Transport acting jointly on a reference to them by Network Rail or the drainage authority, after notice in writing by one to the other.

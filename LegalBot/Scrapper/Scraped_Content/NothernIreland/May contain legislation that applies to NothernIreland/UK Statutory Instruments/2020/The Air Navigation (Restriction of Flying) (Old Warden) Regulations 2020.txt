EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in airspace in the vicinity of Old Warden 
Aerodrome, Buckinghamshire, during flying displays for the general public that are scheduled to 
take place there on 3rd and 16th May, 7th and 20th June, 5th and 18th July, 2nd and 15th August, 
6th September and 4th October 2020. 
A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and 
therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should 
be restricted in the vicinity of the display for reasons of public safety. 
In relation to regulation 3, the term ‘aircraft’ includes aircraft as classified by Part 1 of Schedule 4 
to the Air Navigation Order 2016. It also includes, by virtue of article 23 of that Order, any small 
balloon, any kite weighing not more than two kilograms, any small unmanned aircraft and any 
parachute including a parascending parachute. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(2) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC), which for the 
purpose of these Regulations is one hour behind British Summer Time (BST).

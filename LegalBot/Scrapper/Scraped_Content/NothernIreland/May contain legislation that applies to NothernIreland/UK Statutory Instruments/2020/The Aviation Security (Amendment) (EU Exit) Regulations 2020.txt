(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in the exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
EU Regulation 2015/1998 prescribes detailed aviation security requirements for the implementation of common basic standards. These Regulations amend the Aviation Security (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“the 2019 Regulations”) to ensure that retained EU law will operate effectively in light of the amendments to EU Regulation 2015/1998 since the 2019 Regulations were made.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

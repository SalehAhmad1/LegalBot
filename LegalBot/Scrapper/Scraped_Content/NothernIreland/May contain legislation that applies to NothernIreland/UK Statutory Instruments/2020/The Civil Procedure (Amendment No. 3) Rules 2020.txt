may, on its own initiative or on application, order the parties to file and exchange costs budgets in a case where the parties are not otherwise required by this Section to do so;
(b)
shall (other than in an exceptional case) make an order to file and exchange costs budgets if all parties consent to an application for such an order.
(4) The court may, in a substantial case, direct that budgets are to be limited in the first instance to part only of the proceedings and extended later to cover the whole proceedings.
(5) Every budget must be dated and verified by a statement of truth signed by a senior legal representative of the party.
(6) Even though a litigant in person is not required to prepare a budget, each other party (other than a litigant in person) must provide the litigant in person with a copy of that party’s budget.”

annexed to the order approving the budgeted costs or recording the parties’ agreement.
(8) A costs management order concerns the totals allowed for each phase of the budget, and while the underlying detail in the budget for each phase used by the party to calculate the totals claimed is provided for reference purposes to assist the court in fixing a budget, it is not the role of the court in the costs management hearing to fix or approve the hourly rates claimed in the budget.”

3.15A.—(1) A party (“the revising party”) must revise its budgeted costs upwards or downwards if significant developments in the litigation warrant such revisions.

(5) In rule 3.17, after paragraph (2) insert—
“(3) Subject to rule 3.15A, the court—
(a)
may not approve costs incurred before the date of any costs management hearing; but
(b)
may record its comments on those costs and take those costs into account when considering the reasonableness and proportionality of all budgeted costs.
(4) If an interim application is made but is not included in a budget, the court may, if it considers it reasonable not to have included the application in the budget, treat the costs of such interim application as additional to the approved budgets.”

Scope
81.1.—(1)  This Part sets out the procedure to be followed in proceedings for contempt of court (“contempt proceedings”).
(2) This Part does not alter the scope and extent of the jurisdiction of courts determining contempt proceedings, whether inherent, statutory or at common law.
(3) This Part has effect subject to and to the extent that it is consistent with the substantive law of contempt of court.
Interpretation
81.2.  In this Part—
“claimant” means a person making a contempt application;
“contempt application” means an application to the court for an order determining contempt proceedings;
“defendant” means the person against whom the application is made;
“order of committal” means the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment (whether immediate or suspended) for contempt of court;
“penal notice” means a prominent notice on the front of an order warning that if the person against whom the order is made (and, in the case of a corporate body, a director or officer of that body) disobeys the court’s order, the person (or director or officer) may be held in contempt of court and punished by a fine, imprisonment, confiscation of assets or other punishment under the law.
How to make a contempt application
81.3.—(1) A contempt application made in existing High Court or county court proceedings is made by an application under Part 23 in those proceedings, whether or not the application is made against a party to those proceedings.
(2) If the application is made in the High Court, it shall be determined by a High Court judge of the Division in which the case is proceeding. If it is made in the county court, it shall be determined by a Circuit Judge sitting in the county court.
(3) A contempt application in relation to alleged interference with the due administration of justice, otherwise than in existing High Court or county court proceedings, is made by an application to the High Court under Part 8.
(4) Where an application under Part 8 is made under paragraph (3), the rules in Part 8 apply except as modified by this Part and the defendant is not required to acknowledge service of the application.
(5) Permission to make a contempt application is required where the application is made in relation to—
(a)
interference with the due administration of justice, except in relation to existing High Court or county court proceedings;
(b)
an allegation of knowingly making a false statement in any affidavit, affirmation or other document verified by a statement of truth or in a disclosure statement.
(6) If permission to make the application is needed, the application for permission shall be included in the contempt application, which will proceed to a full hearing only if permission is granted.
(7) If permission is needed and the application relates to High Court proceedings, the question of permission shall be determined by a single judge of the Division in which the case is proceeding. If permission is granted the contempt application shall be determined by a single judge or Divisional Court of that Division.
(8) If permission is needed and the application does not relate to existing court proceedings or relates to criminal or county court proceedings or to proceedings in the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal, the question of permission shall be determined by a single judge of the Administrative Court. If permission is granted, the contempt application shall be determined by a Divisional Court.
Requirements of a contempt application
81.4.—(1) Unless and to the extent that the court directs otherwise, every contempt application must be supported by written evidence given by affidavit or affirmation.
(2) A contempt application must include statements of all the following, unless (in the case of (b) to (g)) wholly inapplicable—

that the court may proceed in the defendant’s absence if they do not attend but (whether or not they attend) will only find the defendant in contempt if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the facts constituting contempt and that they do constitute contempt;
(p)
that if the court is satisfied that the defendant has committed a contempt, the court may punish the defendant by a fine, imprisonment, confiscation of assets or other punishment under the law;
(q)

Service of a contempt application
81.5.—(1) Unless the court directs otherwise in accordance with Part 6 and except as provided in paragraph (2), a contempt application and evidence in support must be served on the defendant personally.
(2) Where a legal representative for the defendant is on the record in the proceedings in which, or in connection with which, an alleged contempt is committed—
(a)
the contempt application and evidence in support may be served on the representative for the defendant unless the representative objects in writing within seven days of receipt of the application and evidence in support;
(b)
if the representative does not object in writing, they must at once provide to the defendant a copy of the contempt application and the evidence supporting it and take all reasonable steps to ensure the defendant understands them;
(c)
if the representative objects in writing, the issue of service shall be referred to a judge of the court dealing with the contempt application; and the judge shall consider written representations from the parties and determine the issue on the papers, without (unless the judge directs otherwise) an oral hearing.
Cases where no application is made
81.6.—(1) If the court considers that a contempt of court (including a contempt in the face of the court) may have been committed, the court on its own initiative shall consider whether to proceed against the defendant in contempt proceedings.
(2) Where the court does so, any other party in the proceedings may be required by the court to give such assistance to the court as is proportionate and reasonable, having regard to the resources available to that party.
(3) If the court proceeds of its own initiative, it shall issue a summons to the defendant which includes the matters set out in rule 81.4(2)(a)-(s) (in so far as applicable) and requires the defendant to attend court for directions to be given.
(4) A summons issued under this rule shall be served on the defendant personally and on any other party, unless the court directs otherwise. If rule 81.5(2) applies, the procedure there set out shall be followed unless the court directs otherwise.
Directions for hearing of contempt proceedings
81.7.—(1) The court shall give such directions as it thinks fit for the hearing and determination of contempt proceedings, including directions for the attendance of witnesses and oral evidence, as it considers appropriate.
(2) The court may issue a bench warrant to secure the attendance of the defendant at a directions hearing or at the substantive hearing.
(3) The court may not give any direction compelling the defendant to give evidence either orally or in writing.
Hearings and judgments in contempt proceedings
81.8.—(1) In accordance with rule 39.2, all hearings of contempt proceedings shall, irrespective of the parties’ consent, be listed and heard in public unless the court otherwise directs.
(2) Advocates and the judge shall appear robed in all hearings of contempt proceedings, whether or not the court sits in public.
(3) Before deciding to sit in private for all or part of the hearing, the court shall notify the national print and broadcast media, via the Press Association.
(4) The court shall consider any submissions from the parties or media organisations before deciding whether and if so to what extent the hearing should be in private.
(5) If the court decides to sit in private it shall, before doing so, sit in public to give a reasoned public judgment setting out why it is doing so.
(6) At the conclusion of the hearing, whether or not held in private, the court shall sit in public to give a reasoned public judgment stating its findings and any punishment.
(7) The court shall inform the defendant of the right to appeal without permission, the time limit for appealing and the court before which any appeal must be brought.
(8) The court shall be responsible for ensuring that judgments in contempt proceedings are transcribed and published on the website of the judiciary of England and Wales.
Powers of the court in contempt proceedings
81.9.—(1) If the court finds the defendant in contempt of court, the court may impose a period of imprisonment (an order of committal), a fine, confiscation of assets or other punishment permitted under the law.
(2) Execution of an order of committal requires issue of a warrant of committal. An order of committal and a warrant of committal have immediate effect unless and to the extent that the court decides to suspend execution of the order or warrant.
(3) An order or warrant of committal must be personally served on the defendant unless the court directs otherwise.
(4) To the extent that the substantive law permits, a court may attach a power of arrest to a committal order.
(5) An order or warrant of committal may not be enforced more than two years after the date it was made unless the court directs otherwise.

81.10.—(1) A defendant against whom a committal order has been made may apply to discharge it.
(2) Any such application shall be made by an application notice under Part 23 in the contempt proceedings.
(3) The court hearing such an application shall consider all the circumstances and make such order under the law as it thinks fit.”EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 (SI 1998/3132) by—
amending Part 3 to make consolidated provision, incorporating provisions previously in Practice Direction 3E, in relation to costs budgets, particularly the circumstances in which costs budgets may be revised and varied;
amending Part 7 to ensure that claims against Welsh public bodies which challenge the lawfulness of their decisions are issued and heard in Wales;
amending Part 30 to make provision in relation to the transfer of proceedings for the enforcement of a judgment or order for possession of land by the County Court to the High Court;
amending Part 32 to substitute for rule 32.14 a reformulated rule about the consequences of making a false statement in a document supported by a statement of truth;
amending Part 34 to make provision for the procedure in relation to requests for evidence to be taken for use in a foreign court;
amending Tables 6 and 6A in rule 45.18, to remove the words ‘but not more than £25,000’ from the headings to the second column of each table, which might otherwise be taken to preclude the recovery of any fixed costs in Stage 3 proceedings for damages totalling more than £25,000;
amending rule 61.13 to insert a signpost to new paragraph 26A of Practice Direction 52C, which makes provision regarding assessors who assist the Court of Appeal in appeals from decisions of the Admiralty Court;
amending rules 73.7 and 73.10 to enable a legal adviser to make an order that, unless a judgment creditor files certain documents by a specified date, an application for a charging order is to be dismissed and an interim charging order discharged;
amending Part 77 in relation to the time limit for making an application in relation to a “tainted acquittal”;
substituting Part 81 with a new Part 81 – Applications and proceedings in relation to contempt of court, that streamlines and simplifies the process for proceedings for contempt of court. The new Part follows consultation by the Civil Procedure Rule Committee: “Proposed rule changes relating to contempt of court: redraft of CPR Part 81”, which ran from 9 March 2020 to 11 May 2020. This instrument also contains amendments consequential on the introduction of new Part 81, to rule 31.23, 83.13, 83.14, 89.16 and 89.17, as well as amendments to introduce two new provisions: rule 34.7A and 70.1A. The amendments to rules 31.23, 83.13 and 83.14 are essentially cross-reference changes. New rule 34.7A replaces former rule 81.36 (fines imposed under section 55 of the County Courts Act 1984) and new rule 70.1A replaces former rules 81.37 and 81.38 (fines under the County Courts Act 1984 generally). The amendment to rule 89.16 has the effect of incorporating with modifications former rule 81.36; previously, rule 89.16 applied former rule 81.36 with modifications to an order under section 14 of the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971 (1971 c. 32). The amendment to rule 89.17 has the effect of incorporating with modifications former rule 81.37 and 81.38; previously rule 89.17 applied former rules 81.37 and 81.38 with modifications to proceedings under section 23(2) of the Attachment of Earnings Act 1971.
amending Part 83 to make provision about writs and warrants of possession, including provision requiring a notice of eviction to be delivered before a writ or warrant of possession can be executed.

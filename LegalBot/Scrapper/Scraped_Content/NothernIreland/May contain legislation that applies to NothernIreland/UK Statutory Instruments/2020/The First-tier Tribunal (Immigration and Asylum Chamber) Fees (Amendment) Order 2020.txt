Fee remission
2.  If a party satisfies the disposable capital test, the amount of any fee remission is calculated by applying the gross monthly income test.
Disposable capital test
Disposable capital test
3.—(1) Subject to paragraph 4, a party satisfies the disposable capital test if—
(a)
the fee payable by the party and for which an application for remission is made, falls within a fee band set out in column 1 of Table 1; and
(b)
the party’s disposable capital is less than the amount in the corresponding row of column 2.
Table 1
Column 1 (fee band) Column 2 (disposable capital)
Up to and including £1,000 £3,000
£1,001 to £1,335 £4,000
£1,336 to £1,665 £5,000
£1,666 to £2,000 £6,000
£2,001 to £2,330 £7,000
£2,331 to £4,000 £8,000
£4,001 to £5,000 £10,000
£5,001 to £6,000 £12,000
£6,001 to £7,000 £14,000
£7,001 or more £16,000
4.  Subject to paragraph 14, if a party or their partner is aged 61 or over, that party satisfies the disposable capital test if that party’s disposable capital is less than £16,000.
Disposable capital
5.  Subject to paragraph 14, disposable capital is the value of every resource of a capital nature belonging to the party on the date on which the application for remission is made, unless it is treated as income by this Order, or it is disregarded as excluded disposable capital.
Disposable capital – non-money resources
6.  The value of a resource of a capital nature that does not consist of money is calculated as the amount which that resource would realise if sold, less—
(a)
10% of the sale value; and
(b)
the amount of any borrowing secured against that resource that would be repayable on sale.
Disposable capital – resources held outside the United Kingdom
7.—(1) Capital resources in a country outside the United Kingdom count towards disposable capital.
(2) If there is no prohibition in that country against the transfer of a resource into the United Kingdom, the value of that resource is the amount which that resource would realise if sold in that country, in accordance with paragraph 6.
(3) If there is a prohibition in that country against the transfer of a resource into the United Kingdom, the value of that resource is the amount that resource would realise if sold to a buyer in the United Kingdom.
Disposable capital – foreign currency resources
8.  Where disposable capital is held in currency other than sterling, the cost of any banking charge or commission that would be payable if that amount were converted into sterling, is deducted from its value.
Disposable capital – jointly owned resources
9.  Where any resource of a capital nature is owned jointly or in common, there is a presumption that the resource is owned in equal shares, unless evidence to the contrary is produced.
Excluded disposable capital
10.  The following things are excluded disposable capital—
(a)
a property which is the main or only dwelling occupied by the party;
(b)
the household furniture and effects of the main or only dwelling occupied by the party;
(c)
articles of personal clothing;
(d)
any vehicle, the sale of which would leave the party, or their partner, without motor transport,
(e)
tools and implements of trade, including vehicles used for business purposes;
(f)
the capital value of the party’s or their partner’s business, where the party or their partner is self-employed;
(g)
the capital value of any funds or other assets held in trust, where the party or their partner is a beneficiary without entitlement to advances of any trust capital;
(h)
a jobseeker’s back to work bonus;
(i)
a payment made as a result of a determination of unfair dismissal by a court or tribunal, or by way of settlement of a claim for unfair dismissal;
(j)
any compensation paid as a result of a determination of medical negligence or in respect of any personal injury by a court, or by way of settlement of a claim for medical negligence or personal injury;
(k)
the capital held in any personal or occupational pension scheme;
(l)
any cash value payable on surrender of a contract of insurance;
(m)
any capital payment made out of the Independent Living Funds;
(n)
any bereavement support payment in respect of the rate set out in regulation 3(2) or (5) of the Bereavement Support Payment Regulations 2017(27);
(o)
any capital insurance or endowment lump sum payments that have been paid as a result of illness, disability or death;
(p)
any student loan or student grant;
(q)
any payments under the criminal injuries compensation scheme.
Gross monthly income test
Remission of fees – gross monthly income
11.—(1) If a party satisfies the disposable capital test, no fee is payable under this Order if, at the time when the fee would otherwise be payable, the party or their partner has the number of children specified in column 1 of Table 2 and—
(a)
if the party is single, their gross monthly income does not exceed the amount set out in the appropriate row of column 2; or
(b)
if the party is one of a couple, the gross monthly income of that couple does not exceed the amount set out in the appropriate row of column 3.
Table 2

Number of children of party Single Couple
no children £1,085 £1,245
1 child £1,330 £1,490
2 children £1,575 £1,735
(2) If a party or their partner has more than 2 children, the relevant amount of gross monthly income is the appropriate amount specified in Table 2 for 2 children, plus the sum of £245 for each additional child.
(3) For every £10 of gross monthly income received above the appropriate amount in Table 2, including any additional amount added under sub-paragraph (2), the party must pay £5 towards the fee payable, up to the maximum amount of the fee payable.
(4) This paragraph is subject to paragraph 12.
Gross monthly income cap
12.—(1) No remission is available if a party or their partner has the number of children specified in column 1 of Table 3 and—
(a)
if the party is single, their gross monthly income exceeds the amount set out in the appropriate row of column 2 of Table 3; or
(b)
if the party is one of a couple, the gross monthly income of that couple exceeds the amount set out in the appropriate row of column 3 of Table 3.

Gross monthly income
13.—(1) Subject to paragraph 14, gross monthly income means the total monthly income, for the month preceding that in which the application for remission is made, from all sources, other than receipt of any of the excluded benefits.
(2) Income from a trade, business or gainful occupation other than an occupation at a wage or salary is calculated as—
(a)
the profits which have accrued or will accrue to the party; and
(b)
the drawings of the party;
in the month preceding that in which the application for remission is made.
(3) In calculating profits under sub-paragraph (2)(a), all sums necessarily expended to earn those profits are deducted.
Resources and income treated as the party’s resources and income
14.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), the disposable capital and gross monthly income of a partner of a party is to be treated as disposable capital and gross monthly income of the party.
(2) Where the partner of a party has a contrary interest to the party in the matter to which the fee relates, the disposable capital and gross monthly income of that partner, if any, is not treated as the disposable capital and gross monthly income of the party.
Application for remission of a fee
15.—(1) An application for remission of a fee must be made at the time when the fee would otherwise be payable.
(2) Where an application for remission of a fee is made, the party must—
(a)
indicate the fee to which the application relates;

declare the amount of their disposable capital; and
(c)
provide documentary evidence of their gross monthly income and the number of children relevant for the purposes of paragraphs 11 and 12.
(3) Where an application for remission of a fee is made on or before the date on which a fee is payable, the date for payment of the fee is disapplied.
(4) Where an application for remission is refused, or if reduction of a fee is granted, the amount of the fee which remains unremitted must be paid within the period notified in writing to the party.
Refunds
16.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (3), where a party pays a fee at a time when that party would have been entitled to a remission if they had provided the documentary evidence required by paragraph 15, the fee, or the amount by which the fee would have been reduced as the case may be, must be refunded if documentary evidence relating to the time when the fee became payable is provided at a later date.
(2) No refund shall be made under this paragraph unless the party who paid the fee applies within 3 months of the date on which the fee was paid.
(3) The Lord Chancellor may extend the period of 3 months mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) if the Lord Chancellor considers that there is a good reason for a refund being made after the end of the period of 3 months.

16th March 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The First-tier Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Fees Order 2011 (“the 2011 Order”) (S.I. 2011/2841) prescribes the fees that are payable for appeals to the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal. This Order amends the 2011 Order to introduce a scheme for the remission of fees for appellants who are in the United Kingdom when they bring their appeal.
Eligibility for remission or reduction of a fee will be based on two tests - a disposable capital test and a gross monthly income test. These tests are set out in a Schedule (“the Schedule”) which is inserted into the 2011 Order by article 2(4) of this Order.
Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Schedule set out the disposable capital test. Appellants who satisfy the disposable capital test will receive a full fee remission, pay a contribution to the fee or have to pay the fee in full, as determined by the gross monthly income test set out in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Schedule.
The gross monthly income test applies a series of thresholds to single people or couples, with an allowance for the number of dependent children they have. Appellants with a gross monthly income below a certain threshold will receive a full fee remission. Appellants will be required to pay a contribution of £5 towards their fee for every £10 of gross monthly income they earn over the relevant threshold.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the Ministry of Justice, HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) and HMCTS users is available from the Ministry of Justice, 102 Petty France, London, SW1H 9AJ and is published with an Explanatory Memorandum alongside the instrument on https://legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations apply where a court makes an order under section 34(4) or section 67F(3) of the Courts Act 2003 (c. 39) (“the 2003 Act”), or section 29D(3) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (c. 15) (“the 2007 Act”), that the Lord Chancellor make a payment in respect of the costs of a person in the proceedings. The Regulations provide for when such an order cannot be made, and for how the costs are to be determined when such an order can be made.
Section 34(4) of the 2003 Act applies where a court is prevented by section 34(1) of that Act from ordering a justice of the peace to pay costs in any proceedings in respect of any act or omission in the execution (or purported execution) of any duty as a justice of the peace. Section 67F(3) of the 2003 Act similarly applies where a court is prevented by 67F(1) of that Act from ordering an authorised person to pay costs in any proceedings in respect of any act or omission of the authorised person in the execution (or purported execution) of that person’s duty as an authorised person when exercising a relevant judicial function by virtue of section 67B(1) of the 2003 Act.
Section 29D(3) of the 2007 Act similarly applies where a court is prevented by section 29D(1) of that Act from ordering an authorised person to pay costs in any proceedings in respect of any act or omission of the authorised person in the execution (or purported execution) of that person’s duty as an authorised person when exercising a function of a tribunal by virtue of paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to the 2007 Act.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

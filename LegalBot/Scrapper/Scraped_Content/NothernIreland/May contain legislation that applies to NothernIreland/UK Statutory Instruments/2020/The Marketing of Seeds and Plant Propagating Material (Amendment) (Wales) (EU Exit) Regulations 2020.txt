15 December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations amend domestic secondary EU Exit legislation relating to seeds, plants for planting and reproductive material as a consequence of EU Exit. Regulation 2 also addresses errors identified in domestic secondary EU Exit legislation.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

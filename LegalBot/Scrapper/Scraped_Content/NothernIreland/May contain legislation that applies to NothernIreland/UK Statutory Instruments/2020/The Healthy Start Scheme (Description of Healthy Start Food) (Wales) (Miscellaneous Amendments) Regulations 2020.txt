(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Healthy Start Scheme (Description of Healthy Start Food) (Wales) Regulations 2006 (“the principal Regulations”). These Regulations also amend the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) (Wales) Regulations 2004.
Regulation 2 of the principal Regulations provides that Healthy Start food, in relation to the operation of the Healthy Start scheme in Wales, is as set out in the Schedule to those Regulations. Regulation 2(3) of these Regulations expands the definition of Healthy Start food to include canned fruit and vegetables and pulses.
Regulation 3 of the principal Regulations provides the description of Healthy Start vitamins that will apply in relation to the operation of the Healthy Start scheme in Wales. Regulation 2(2) of these Regulations makes amendments to remove the restriction that Healthy Start vitamins must be provided in tablet or drop form only, with the effect that they may be produced in any form.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amend the National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) (Wales) Regulations 2004 to remove the requirement to produce a certificate confirming pregnancy for the purposes of obtaining welfare food.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

However, latching in an intermediate position is not required if a safety-bolt with an audible warning device is provided as specified in the paragraph 2(b) below. Door latches must be designed to prevent the doors from opening accidentally. For the purposes of this item, “longitudinal plane” means a vertical plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of a vehicle. 1 Column 1, paragraph 2 does not apply to doors which do not give direct access to a seat designed for normal use while a vehicle is travelling on a road.

— provide for limits on the number of end-of-series vehicles entering into service (regulation 27)
— provide for derogations from the requirements of the Type Approval Regulation in respect of components or separate technical units intended for fitment to vehicles which have been exempted from one or more provisions of the Type Approval Regulation, or which are not required to be type-approved by the Type Approval Regulation (regulation 28)
— provide for breach of these Regulations, the Type Approval Regulation or legislation listed in Schedule 5 to be an offence, and for offences to be punishable either by criminal or civil penalties (regulation 29 and Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 4)

— provide for the continuation under these Regulations or the Type Approval Regulation of anything done under, or by virtue of, any regulation revoked by these Regulations, if it could have been done under or for the purpose of the corresponding provision of these Regulations or the Type Approval Regulation (regulation 30(2))
— make transitional provision in respect of existing national small series type approvals of vehicles over 4m in height (regulation 31)
— make transitional provision until the end of 2020 in respect of requirements for paper certificates of conformity in connection with national small series type approval (regulation 32)
These Regulations also transpose the obligation in Article 113 of, and paragraph 3 of Annex XI to, Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (OJ No. L 321, 17.12.2018, p.36) in relation to interoperability for car radio receivers (regulation 22).
The net costs imposed on business, the voluntary sector and the public sector by these Regulations have been assessed as being less than £5m in any year and therefore a full impact assessment has not been prepared, and a review provision not included.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/661, “the 2015 Order”) so as to designate Plough Lane occupied by A. F. C. Wimbledon, and Holker Street occupied by Barrow Association Football Club, as sports grounds for which a safety certificate is required under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (c. 52, “the 1975 Act”).
As well as being occupied by members of the Football League Limited, both are sports grounds in England and Wales at which association football matches are played and which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, have accommodation for more than 5,000 spectators.
The 2015 Order is also amended so that Zebra Claims Stadium and Cherry Red Records Stadium are no longer designated as sports grounds for which a safety certificate is required under the 1975 Act.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

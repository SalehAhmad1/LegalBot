(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make consequential provisions in exercise of the power in section 41(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 (c. 1) (“the 2020 Act”). They amend legislation made as a consequence of exiting the European Union, which relates to the Kimberley Process certification scheme concerning the import and export of rough diamonds and measures to minimise the trade of rough diamonds from conflict zones.
Regulations 3 and 4 substitute “IP completion day” for two references to exit day in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/844). Regulation 3 makes provision for the validity of export certificates issued under the Council Regulation (EC) No. 2368/2002 prior to IP completion day and regulation 4 makes provision for certain reporting prior to IP completion day by auditors to meet requirements in relation to applications by organisations representing traders in rough diamonds for listing as self-regulating organisations.
The amended provisions will come into force on IP completion day by operation of paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the 2020 Act. The amendments made by this instrument ensure that their effects begin from IP completion day rather than from exit day.
An Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this instrument: no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sectors in the United Kingdom.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Road Traffic Act 1988 generally prohibits the use of a motor vehicle without a test certificate on a road in Great Britain. In anticipation of disruption to the vehicle testing regime caused by the spread of coronavirus, the Motor Vehicles (Tests) (Amendment) (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 provided for a six-month exclusion from the test certificate requirement for light vehicles due to be tested between 30th March 2020 and 29th March 2021, with the six-month period for each vehicle beginning on the day after it was due to be tested.
This instrument brings forward the last day on which an exclusion can begin to 1st August 2020 and provides for the revocation on 1st February 2021 of the provisions relating to the exclusion immediately after the last six-month period ends.
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations. An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared and is available alongside this instrument on the UK Legislation website www.legislation.gov.uk.

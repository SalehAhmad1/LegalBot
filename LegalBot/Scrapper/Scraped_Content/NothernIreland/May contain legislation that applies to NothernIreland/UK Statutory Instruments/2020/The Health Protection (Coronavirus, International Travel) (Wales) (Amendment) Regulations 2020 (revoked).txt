(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (the “International Travel Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include requiring persons to isolate for a period of 14 days. The requirements are subject to exceptions, and certain categories of person are exempt from having to comply.
The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Public Health Information to Travellers) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (“the amendment regulations”) amended the International Travel Regulations. By virtue of those amendments, persons entering Wales after being in one or more of the countries and territories listed in Schedule 3 to the International Travel Regulations (as inserted by the amendment regulations) are not required to isolate. The countries and territories listed in Schedule 3 are referred to as “exempt countries and territories”.
These Regulations amend the International Travel Regulations to remove Serbia from the Schedule 3 list of exempt countries and territories.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely cost and benefit of complying with these Regulations.

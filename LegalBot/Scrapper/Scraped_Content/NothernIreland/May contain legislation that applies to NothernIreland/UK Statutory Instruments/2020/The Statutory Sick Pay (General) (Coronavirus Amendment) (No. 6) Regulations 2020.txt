Regulation 2(2), (4) and (5) of these Regulations amends Schedule 1 to the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982 (S.I. 1982/894) to provide that a person is entitled to statutory sick pay if they—
(a)
have been notified that they are to undergo a surgical or other hospital procedure;
(b)
have been advised to stay at home for a period of up to 14 days prior to being admitted to hospital for that procedure; and
(c)
stay at home pursuant to that advice.
Paragraph (3) corrects an error in that Schedule.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations in view of the urgency required to provide additional financial support to those unable to work as a result of coronavirus.

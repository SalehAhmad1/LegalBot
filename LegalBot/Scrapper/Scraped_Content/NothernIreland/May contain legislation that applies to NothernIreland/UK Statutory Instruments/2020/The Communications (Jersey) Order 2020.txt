(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends amendments to the Communications Act 2003 (c. 21) made by section 89 of the Digital Economy Act 2017 (c. 30) to Jersey. The amendments set out in section 89 of the 2017 Act (TV licence fee concessions by reference to age) amend section 365 of, and insert section 365A into, the 2003 Act and come into force on 1st June 2020. From that date TV licence fee concessions will no longer be determined by regulations but determined independently by the BBC following consultation. The BBC will have the power to make changes to the concession, including changing the eligibility criteria, level of concession and qualifying age (although this may not be lower than 65) or to end the concession. The Secretary of State retains the power to make provision for all other concessions including the current residential care concession or its equivalent.

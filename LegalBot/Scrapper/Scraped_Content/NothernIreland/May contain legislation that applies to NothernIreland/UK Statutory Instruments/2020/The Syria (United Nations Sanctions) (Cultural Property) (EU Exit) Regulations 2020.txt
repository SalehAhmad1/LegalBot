(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) to establish a sanctions regime in relation to the trade in Syrian cultural property for the purposes of compliance with the United Kingdom's United Nations obligations in Security Council resolution 2199 adopted by the Security Council on 12 February 2015.
Following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, these Regulations also replace the measures relating to Syrian cultural property in the European Union sanctions regime in relation to Syria, implemented via an EU Council Decision and Regulation.
The Regulations impose trade restrictions on the trade in Syrian cultural property or any other item of archaeological, historical, cultural, rare scientific or religious importance, illegally removed from Syria on or after 15 March 2011.
The Regulations provide for exceptions to this sanctions regime for acts done for the purpose of national security or the prevention of serious crime, and for the return to Syria of illegally removed Syrian cultural property as provided for in UN Security Council resolution 2199.
The Regulations make it a criminal offence to contravene, or circumvent, any of the prohibitions in these Regulations and prescribe the mode of trial and penalties that apply to such offences. They also provide for the application of similar types of provision in the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 to the offences relating to trade in illegally removed Syrian cultural property.
The Regulations also confer powers on specified maritime enforcement officers to stop and search ships in international and foreign waters for the purpose of enforcing specified trade sanctions and to seize goods found on board ships which are being, or have been, dealt with in contravention, or deemed contravention, of those prohibitions. The Regulations prescribe powers for the provision and sharing of information to enable the effective implementation and enforcement of the sanctions regime.
Council Regulation (EU) No 36/2012 of 18 January 2012 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Syria and repealing Regulation (EU) No 442/2011 is revoked by these Regulations. The Export Control (Syria Sanctions) Order 2013 and the Export Control (Syria Sanctions) (Amendment) Order 2014 are also revoked.
An Impact Assessment has not been produced for these Regulations, as they are intended to ensure existing sanctions remain in place following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. These Regulations are intended to deliver substantially the same policy effects as the existing European Union sanctions. An Impact Assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and can be found at: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653271/Sanctions_and_Anti-Money_Laundering_Bill_Impact_Assessment_18102017.pdf.

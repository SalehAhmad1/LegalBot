6th February 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make a consequential amendment to section 267 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44) (“the 2003 Act”). Section 267 allows for an order to modify the application of sections 264 (consecutive terms) of the 2003 Act, to alter the percentage of the proportion of a prisoner’s consecutive sentence that is to be served in custody.
The Criminal Justices and Courts Act 2015 (c.2) (“the 2015 Act”) introduced the sentence for persons of particular concern, inserting sections 236A and 244A into the 2003 Act. Schedule 1 of the 2015 Act also made consequential amendments in respect of the insertions, but a consequential amendment to section 267 was not made under Schedule 1 of the 2015 Act, nor on commencement of the provisions. That amendment is now being made in these Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

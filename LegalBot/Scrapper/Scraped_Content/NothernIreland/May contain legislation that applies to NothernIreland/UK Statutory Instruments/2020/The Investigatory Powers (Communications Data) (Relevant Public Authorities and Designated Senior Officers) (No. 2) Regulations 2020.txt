(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Schedule 4 to the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (c. 25). That Schedule sets out the public authorities, other than local authorities, who may exercise powers under Part 3 of that Act to obtain communications data, the statutory purposes for which the communications data may be obtained, the type of communications data which may be obtained, and the designated senior officers within those authorities who may authorise the obtaining of communications data internally in an urgent case.
Regulation 2 amends Schedule 4 so that fire and rescue authorities under the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 (c. 21) and the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service Board may no longer obtain communications data.
An amendment is also made to the description of the minimum office, rank or position which must be held by a designated senior officer within the Department for Work and Pensions to reflect an organisational change. This amendment does not replace the minimum office, rank or position in relation to the Department for Work and Pensions with a lower office, rank or position.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to secondary legislation relating to school teachers’ qualifications and induction periods, in order to amend requirements which would otherwise not operate as intended as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Regulation 2 amends the Education (School Teachers’ Qualifications) (England) Regulations 2003. It relaxes requirements, during the period between the coming into force of these Regulations and 1st September 2020, to have met prescribed standards before achieving qualified teacher status where it has not been possible to do so for a reason relating to the incidence or transmission of coronavirus. In addition, it provides that, during the same period, a person may complete a period of practical teaching experience which is a requirement of achieving qualified teacher status in a school or other institution outside England where it has not been possible to do so wholly or mainly in an institution in England or in a school administered by Service Children’s Education.
Regulation 3 amends the Education (Induction Arrangements for School Teachers) (England) Regulations 2012 to allow a school teacher to complete a statutory induction period without it being extended due to absence from work of 30 or more days if that absence would have been less than 30 days but for a reason relating to the incidence or transmission of coronavirus.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

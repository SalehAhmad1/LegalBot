1st July 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Healthy Start Scheme and Welfare Food (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/267) (“the Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations”). They rectify a defect in the transitional provisions in the Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations. These Regulations are issued free of charge to all recipients of the Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations.
The Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations amend the Healthy Start Scheme and Welfare Food (Amendment) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/3262) (“the 2005 Regulations”) which establish a scheme to improve nutrition in pregnant women, mothers and young children by providing for vouchers to be issued to beneficiaries to enable the purchase of certain basic foods and vitamins. The Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations make amendments to the 2005 Regulations to provide for the digitisation of the scheme. This includes the gradual replacement of paper vouchers with vouchers in electronic form or in the form of a pre-paid payment card. The Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations also, in regulation 17, expand the foods included within the description of “healthy start food” to include pulses and canned fruit and vegetables. Regulation 17 of the Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations comes into force on 1st October 2020 and applies in relation to England only.
These Regulations amend the transitional provisions in regulation 31 of the Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations to ensure that during the transitional period, when paper vouchers are gradually being replaced with vouchers in electronic form or in the form of a pre-paid payment card, beneficiaries who continue to receive paper vouchers after 1st October 2020 may be able to use those vouchers to purchase a wider range of foods, as provided for in regulation 17 of the Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations. These Regulations rectify the oversight made in the Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

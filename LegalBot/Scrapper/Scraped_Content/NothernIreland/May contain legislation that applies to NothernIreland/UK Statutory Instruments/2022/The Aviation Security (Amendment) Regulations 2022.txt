(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of aviation security.
Regulation 2 amends Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 (aviation security). In particular, the amendments remove the requirement in retained EU law that explosive detection dogs may only be used as a supplementary means of examination of vehicles and permit the use of existing technologies for the purpose of evaluating their use as alternative methods of screening. The amendments also remove from retained EU law the requirement that background or pre-employment checks be completed before beginning security training involving non-publicly available information.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

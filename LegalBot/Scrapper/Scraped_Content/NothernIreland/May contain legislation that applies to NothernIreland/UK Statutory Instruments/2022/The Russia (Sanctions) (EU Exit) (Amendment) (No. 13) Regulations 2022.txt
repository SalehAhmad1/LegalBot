(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) to amend the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
Part 2 makes amendments to the designation criteria in regulation 6 of the 2019 Regulations: first, to specify additional activities for which a person may be designated; second, to make minor amendments to the definition of “being involved in obtaining a benefit from or supporting the Government of Russia”; and third, to broaden the interpretation of being “associated with” a designated person.
Part 3 provides for a new exception from trade sanctions measures for humanitarian assistance activity in non-government controlled areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.
Part 4 makes provision to correct or resolve a number of issues arising from the 2019 Regulations or amendments made to them: first, to expand upon the definition of ownership in relation to ships and aircraft; and second, to correct drafting errors or omissions in regulations 76, 78 and 94.
An Impact Assessment has not been produced for these Regulations, as any impact would result primarily from any future increase in the number of sanctions designations. An Impact Assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and can be found at:https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653271/Sanctions_and_Anti-Money_Laundering_Bill_Impact_Assessment_18102017.pdf.

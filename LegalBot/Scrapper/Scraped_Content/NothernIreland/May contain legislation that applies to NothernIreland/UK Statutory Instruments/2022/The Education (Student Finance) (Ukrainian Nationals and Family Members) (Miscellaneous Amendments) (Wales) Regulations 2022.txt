(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend:
(a)
the Education (Fees and Awards) (Wales) Regulations 2007 (see Part 2 of the Regulations),
(b)
the Education (European University Institute) (Wales) Regulations 2014 (see Part 3 of the Regulations),
(c)
the Higher Education (Qualifying Courses, Qualifying Persons and Supplementary Provision) (Wales) Regulations 2015 (see Part 4 of the Regulations),
(d)
the Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (see Part 5 of the Regulations),
(e)
the Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (see Part 6 of the Regulations),
(f)
the Education (Postgraduate Doctoral Degree Loans) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (see Part 7 of the Regulations), and
(g)
the Education (Student Support) (Postgraduate Master’s Degrees) (Wales) Regulations 2019 (see Part 8 of the Regulations).
The amendments made by these Regulations principally relate to Ukrainian nationals and their family members granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom by virtue of the Ukraine Family Scheme, the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme, the Ukraine Extension Scheme or who have leave outside the immigration rules in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine (“protected Ukrainian nationals”).
The amendments made in Part 2 of the Regulations provide for protected Ukrainian nationals to be treated as home students for the purpose of the Education (Fees and Awards) (Wales) Regulations 2007.
Part 4 of the Regulations amends the Higher Education (Qualifying Courses, Qualifying Persons and Supplementary Provision) (Wales) Regulations 2015 to provide for the tuition fee limit to apply to protected Ukrainian nationals.
Part 3 and Parts 5 to 8 amend the student support Regulations specified by making protected Ukrainian nationals eligible for student support, subject to them meeting all other requirements.
Parts 5 and 6 also make amendments to the student support Regulations to remove the existing restriction preventing distance learning students from qualifying for grants for dependants.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

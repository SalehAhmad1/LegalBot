(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Ammonium Nitrate Materials (High Nitrogen Content) Safety Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/1082). Regulation 2 amends transitional provisions relating to EU Exit, to extend the period during which detonation resistance testing of ammonium nitrate imported into Great Britain can be carried out at competent laboratories based within the UK or the European Union.
Regulation 2 also extends the period during which ammonium nitrate imported into Great Britain from countries within the European Union is exempted from the 60-day limit on the validity period for a detonation resistance test.
The transitional period has been extended from two years to seven years from IP completion day.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

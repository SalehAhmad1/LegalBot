(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings into operation the revised code of practice (“the Code”) issued under paragraph 6(1) and (4) of Schedule 14 to the Terrorism Act 2000 (c. 11) (“the 2000 Act”) in connection with the exercise by examining officers and review officers of functions conferred on them by the 2000 Act. The Code revises the preceding code of practice to take account of amendments made to paragraph 1(2) and paragraph 2 of Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act, and to other relevant enactments, by the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 (c. 36). The amendments to Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act make provision to expand the scope of powers under Schedule 7 so that examining officers will be able to examine and if necessary detain individuals under Schedule 7 away from port and Northern Ireland border areas provided that certain specified conditions as set out in the amended paragraph 2 of Schedule 7 are satisfied. The Code also revises the preceding code of practice to reflect additional minor updates unrelated to the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 (c. 36).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
A copy of the revised code of practice referred to in this instrument can be found publicly available online at www.gov.uk and hard copies can be obtained by writing to the Home Office, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF.

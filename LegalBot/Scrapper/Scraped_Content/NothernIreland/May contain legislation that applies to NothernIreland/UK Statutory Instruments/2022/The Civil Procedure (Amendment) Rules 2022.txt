(b)
in a counterclaim made under rule 20.4, where at the date on which judgment is entered a defence has not been filed,
and, in either case, the relevant time limit for doing so has expired.
(Rule 20.4 makes general provision for a defendant’s counterclaim against a claimant, and rule 20.4(3) provides that Part 10 (acknowledgement of service) does not apply to a counterclaim made under that rule.)
(3) The claimant may not obtain a default judgment if—
(a)
the defendant has applied—
(i)

(Part 14 sets out the procedure where a defendant admits a money claim and asks for time to pay.)
(Rule 6.17 provides that, where the claim form is served by the claimant, the claimant may not obtain default judgment unless a certificate of service has been filed.)
Procedure for obtaining default judgment
12.4.—(1) Subject to paragraph (3), a claimant may obtain a default judgment by filing a request in the relevant practice form where the claim is for—
(a)
a specified amount of money (Form N205A or N225);

an amount of money to be decided by the court (Form N205B or N227);
(c)
delivery of goods where the claim form gives the defendant the alternative of paying their value (N205A, N225); or

any combination of these remedies.
(2) Where the defendant is an individual, the claimant must provide the defendant’s date of birth (if known) where required in the form.

where rule 12.10 or rule 12.11 says so,
and where the defendant is an individual, the claimant must provide the defendant’s date of birth (if known) in Part C of the application notice.
(4) Where a claimant—

claims any other remedy in the claim form in addition to those specified in paragraph (1); but

(b)
the times and rate at which it is to be paid by instalments.
(2) Except where paragraph (4) applies, a default judgment on a claim for a specified amount of money obtained on filing a request, will be judgment for the amount of the claim (less any payments made) and costs, to be paid—
(a)
by the date or at the rate specified in the request for judgment; or
(b)
if none is specified, immediately.
(Interest may be included in a default judgment obtained by filing a request if the conditions set out in rule 12.7 are satisfied.)

(a)
deliver the goods or (if they do not do so) pay the value of the goods as decided by the court (less any payments made); and
(b)
pay costs.
(Rule 12.8 sets out the procedure for deciding the amount of a judgment or the value of the goods.)
(5) The claimant’s right to enter judgment requiring the defendant to deliver goods is subject to rule 40.14 (judgment in favour of certain part owners relating to the detention of goods).
County Court Money Claims

the claimant’s request for judgment includes a calculation of interest from the date up to which interest was calculated in the claim form up to the date of the request for judgment.
(2) In any case where paragraph (1) does not apply, judgment will be for an amount of interest to be decided by the court.

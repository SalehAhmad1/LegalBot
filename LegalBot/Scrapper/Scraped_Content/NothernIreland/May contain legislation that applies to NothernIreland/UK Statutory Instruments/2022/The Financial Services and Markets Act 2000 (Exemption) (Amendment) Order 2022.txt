(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Exemption) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/1201) (“the Exemption Order”).
The Exemption Order exempts certain persons from the general prohibition set out in section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (c. 8), which provides that no person may carry on a regulated activity within the UK without being an authorised person or an exempt person. Regulated activities are activities of a kind specified by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/544) (“the Regulated Activities Order”) which are carried on by way of business.
Article 2 of this Order amends the Exemption Order to exempt Norges Bank from being required to obtain authorisation in respect of any regulated activity of the kind specified by article 14, 21, 25, 37, 40 or 53, of the Regulated Activities Order. Furthermore, pursuant to article 5(2) of the Exemption Order, Norges Bank shall also be exempt from being required to obtain authorisation in respect of regulated activities of the kind specified in article 64 of the Regulated Activities Order so far as relevant to any such activity.

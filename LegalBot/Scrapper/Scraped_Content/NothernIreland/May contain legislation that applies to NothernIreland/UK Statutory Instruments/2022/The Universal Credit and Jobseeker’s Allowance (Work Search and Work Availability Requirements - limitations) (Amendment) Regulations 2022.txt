(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 97(5) of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376) and regulation 14(3)(b) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/378).
Regulation 97(4) and (5) of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 and regulation 14(3) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 2013 apply where a claimant has previously carried out work of a particular nature, or at a particular level of remuneration. In such cases, the Secretary of State is required to limit work search and work availability requirements to work of a similar nature or level of remuneration, provided the Secretary of State is satisfied that the claimant will have reasonable prospects of obtaining paid work in spite of the limitation. The limitation is for such period as the Secretary of State thinks appropriate up to a maximum of 3 months. These Regulations amend the maximum period of the limitation to 4 weeks.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations includes a transitional provision so that any limitation that applies on the date that these Regulations come into force will end either on the day before the day that the limitation no longer applies or, if earlier, 7th March 2022.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 91 of the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 (anaw 1) (“the Act”) requires a landlord, under a secure contract, a periodic standard contract or a fixed term standard contract made for a term of less than 7 years, to ensure that the dwelling is fit for human habitation, and section 92 requires the landlord to keep the dwelling in repair.
Section 94(1) requires the Welsh Ministers to prescribe matters and circumstances to which regard must be had when determining whether a dwelling is fit for human habitation, and section 94(2) enables the Welsh Ministers to prescribe matters and circumstances which may arise because of a landlord’s failure to keep the dwelling in repair. Section 94(3) enables the Welsh Ministers to impose requirements on landlords for the purpose of preventing those matters or circumstances from arising and to prescribe that if those requirements are not complied with, the dwelling is to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation.
Regulation 3 and the Schedule prescribe the matters and circumstances to which regard must be had when determining whether a dwelling is fit for human habitation. This includes certain matters and circumstances which may arise because of a landlord’s failure to keep the dwelling in repair.
Regulation 4 provides that regulations 5 to 8 apply in relation to a secure contract, a periodic standard contract or a fixed term standard contract made for a term of less than 7 years, and which incorporate section 91 of the Act as a term of the contract. Regulation 4 applies regulations 5 to 8 to the same kinds of occupation contract as regulation 3.
Regulations 5 and 6 impose requirements on a landlord for the purpose of preventing any matters or circumstances which may cause a dwelling to be unfit for human habitation from arising.
Regulation 5 requires that smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, in repair and proper working order, are present in a dwelling.
Regulation 6 requires that the electrical service installations in a dwelling are subject to inspection and testing (“an electrical safety inspection”) by a qualified person at intervals of 5 years or less; and that a copy of the condition report setting out the results of the electrical safety inspection is given to the contract-holder. If works are carried out on a dwelling’s electrical service installations between electrical safety inspections, the landlord must ensure that the contract-holder is given written confirmation that the works have been carried out.
Where a landlord fails to comply with a requirement imposed by regulation 5 or 6, the dwelling is to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation; and the dwelling will continue to be treated as if it were unfit for human habitation under those regulations until the failure has been rectified by the landlord (see Part 4 of the Act for further provision about circumstances in which the obligations and liabilities of a landlord under that Part arise). If the failure re-occurs after rectification, the dwelling will again be treated as unfit for human habitation until it is rectified.
The landlord is in any event subject to the obligations in section 92 of the Act (if incorporated into the occupation contract) to keep electrical service installations in repair and proper working order. Those obligations will be relevant where an electrical safety inspection reveals that there are issues with an installation.
Regulation 7 makes provision about how these regulations operate in relation to existing tenancies and licences that become occupation contracts when the Act comes into force. Landlords under those contracts will have additional time within which to ensure compliance.
Regulation 8 makes provision relating to regulation 6, allowing landlords to rely on electrical condition reports obtained before these Regulations come into force.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Department of Housing, Welsh Government, Rhydycar Business Park, Merthyr Tydfil, CF48 1UZ.

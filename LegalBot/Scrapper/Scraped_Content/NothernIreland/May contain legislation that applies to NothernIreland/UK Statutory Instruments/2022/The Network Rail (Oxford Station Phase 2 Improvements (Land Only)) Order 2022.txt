Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply with the necessary modifications as respects compensation in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right as they apply as respects compensation for the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 1 to the Network Rail (Oxford Station Phase 2 Improvements (Land Only)) Order 2022 (“the 2022 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 1 to the 2022 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken” substitute “a right over land is purchased”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 of the 1965 Act, as applied by article 4 (application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) to the acquisition of land under article 3(1) (power to acquire land) applies to the compulsory acquisition of rights under article 6(1) (power to acquire new rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in the case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired is depreciated by the acquisition of the right but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—

(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),

(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 3(1)), it has power, exercisable in the equivalent circumstances and subject to the equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (unauthorised entry) and 13(6)(refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition of the land under this Order, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 4(7)) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A

1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over the whole or part of a house, building or factory.
(2) But see article 7 (power to acquire subsoil or airspace only) of the Network Rail (Oxford Station Phase 2 Improvements (Land Only)) Order 2022 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.

(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of its decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.

(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the proposed use of the right to be acquired, and
(c)

12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

Acquisition of apparatus
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the deposited plans, Network Rail must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Alternative apparatus
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, Network Rail acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of an undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in question.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Network Rail requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the undertaker in question and Network Rail, or in default of such agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 21 (arbitration).
(4) In any case where alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed under sub-paragraph (2), or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus, Network Rail must, subject to sub-paragraph (5), afford to the undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of Network Rail and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(5) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of Network Rail, or Network Rail is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (4) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Network Rail, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(6) The undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 21 (arbitration), and after the grant to the undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (4) or (5), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by Network Rail to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(7) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (6), if Network Rail gives notice in writing to the undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work to which this paragraph applies, that work, instead of being executed by the undertaker, must be executed by Network Rail without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker.
(8) Nothing in sub-paragraph (7) authorises Network Rail to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail affords to an undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of Network Rail of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Network Rail and the undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 21 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of Network Rail, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Network Rail in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Network Rail to that undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Existing apparatus: protection and access
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2), Network Rail must submit to the undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and an officer of the undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by an undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If an undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by Network Rail, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to Network Rail of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Network Rail from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) Network Rail is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must repay to an undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any of such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule (other than apparatus that is re-used as alternative apparatus) is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 21 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an undertaker in respect of works under sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Any dispute as to whether a financial benefit is conferred in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or as to the amount of such financial benefit which cannot be agreed is to be determined in accordance with article 21 (arbitration).
Damage to apparatus: costs, losses, etc.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the authorised works any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of an undertaker or there is any interruption in any service provided or in the supply of any goods by any undertaker, Network Rail must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on Network Rail with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of an undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) An undertaker must give Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of Network Rail which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (1) and/or (2) apply, SGN may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) or as relevant sub-paragraph (4), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and SGN and in accordance with all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and SGN will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works having given reasonable notice of their wish to do so.
(7) Where SGN requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to SGN’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If SGN, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 5 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 5(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to SGN notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with—

the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances (where any such applicable conditions have been imposed at that time); and
(b)
sub-paragraph (11) at a times.
(11) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised works the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that SGN retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 8 (expenses).
Expenses
8.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to SGN on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by SGN in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or rights or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—

(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 21 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to SGN by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible or appropriate in the circumstances (including due to statutory or regulatory changes) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.

Acquisition of apparatus
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the deposited plans, Network Rail must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Alternative apparatus
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, Network Rail acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that the undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of the undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (8).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Network Rail requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the undertaker written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the undertaker and Network Rail, or in default of such agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 21 (arbitration).
(4) In any case where alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed under sub-paragraph (2), or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order the undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus, Network Rail must, subject to sub-paragraph (5), afford to the undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of Network Rail and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(5) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of Network Rail, or Network Rail is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (4), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Network Rail, as soon as reasonably possible use its reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(6) The undertaker must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 21 (arbitration), and after the grant to the undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (4) or (5), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by Network Rail to be removed under the provisions of this Schedule.
(7) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (7), if Network Rail gives notice in writing to the undertaker that it desires itself to execute any work to which this paragraph applies, that work, instead of being executed by the undertaker, must be executed by Network Rail without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker.
(8) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises Network Rail to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 600 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule, Network Rail affords to the undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of Network Rail of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Network Rail and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 21 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of Network Rail, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Network Rail in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the undertaker than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Network Rail to the undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Existing apparatus: protection and access
8.—(1) In connection with the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2) Network Rail must 2 months prior to any notice required under paragraph 8(2) consult with the undertaker on its plans and works to be executed and use reasonable endeavours to incorporate any comments from the undertaker.
(2) Not less than 35 days before starting the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2), Network Rail must submit to the undertaker a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(3) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (2) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (4) by the undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and an officer of the undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(4) Any requirements made by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (3) must be made within a period of 30 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (2) are submitted to it.
(5) If the undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (4) and in consequence of the works proposed by Network Rail, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to Network Rail of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2).
(6) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Network Rail from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 35 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(7) Network Rail is not required to comply with sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the undertaker notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail will indemnify the undertaker in respect of all reasonable costs, charges and expenses incurred by that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus (and in considering whether these are required) or the construction of any new apparatus (including costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of rights or interests in land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any of such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule (other than apparatus that is re-used as alternative apparatus) is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 21 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertaker by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess provided always that no deduction is to be applied should the new apparatus or its specific placement be required in order to comply with current design standards.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertaker in respect of works under sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Any dispute as to whether a financial benefit is conferred in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or as to the amount of such financial benefit which cannot be agreed is to be determined in accordance with article 21 (arbitration).
Damage to apparatus: costs, losses, etc.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of any of the authorised works or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works or in consequence of any act or default of the Network Rail (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works or any subsidence resulting from any of the authorised works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or damage to the property of the undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by the undertaker, or the undertaker becomes liable to a third party for any expense, loss, demand, proceeding, damage, interruption, claim, penalty, cost, action or liability to the extent that is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Network Rail, its officers, contractors or agents, Network Rail must—
(a)
indemnify the reasonable cost incurred by the undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify the undertaker for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from the undertaker, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or the undertaker becoming liable to any third party.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on Network Rail with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of the undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) The undertaker must give Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of Network Rail which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

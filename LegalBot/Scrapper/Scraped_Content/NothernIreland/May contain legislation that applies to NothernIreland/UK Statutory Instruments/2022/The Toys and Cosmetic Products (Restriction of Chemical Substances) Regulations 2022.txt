Regulation 3(3) prohibits the use of the chemicals listed in the Schedule to the Regulations following their classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic under the retained EU legislation, Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, and regulation 3(4), (5), (7) and (8) make consequential amendments to the technical annexes of the Cosmetics Regulation.

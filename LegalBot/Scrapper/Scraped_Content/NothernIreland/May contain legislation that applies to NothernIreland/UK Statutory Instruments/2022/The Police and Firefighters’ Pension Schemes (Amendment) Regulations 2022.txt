16th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (England) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2848) (“the Firefighters’ Regulations”) and the Police Pensions Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/445) (“the Police Regulations”) in consequence of provision made by the Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7).
The amendments ensure that the existing pension schemes established by the Firefighters’ Pension Scheme (England) Order 2006 (No. 3432) (“the NFSPS”), the Firemen’s Pension Scheme Order 1992 (S.I. 1992/129) (“the 1992 Firefighters’ Scheme”), the Police Pensions Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/257) and the Police Pensions Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/3541) (“the 2006 Police Scheme”) will, except for limited purposes, be closed to the accrual of pension benefits on and after 1st April 2022, and that any members currently treated as being in pensionable service under the existing pension schemes will, on that date, begin accruing benefits in the scheme established by, as appropriate, the Firefighters’ Regulations (“the 2014 Firefighters’ Scheme”) or the Police Regulations (“the 2015 Police Scheme”).
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 65 of the Firefighters’ Regulations so that where members of the 1992 Firefighters’ Scheme are awaiting a decision on whether they are entitled to an ill-health award when they join the 2014 Firefighters’ Scheme on 1st April 2022, the criteria used to determine entitlement to such an award reflect the criteria in the 1992 Firefighters’ Scheme (where normal pension age is 55, not 60 as under the 2014 Firefighters’ Scheme).
Regulation 2(3) amends Schedule 2 to the Firefighters’ Regulations as follows—
the definitions of “closing date” and “transition date” in paragraph 1 are amended to insert dates in respect of those terms that apply to full protection members so that provisions which refer to those terms operate as intended in respect of such members;
paragraph 3(3) is amended so that a scheme manager may only set a tapered protection closing date under that paragraph if such date is before 1st April 2022;
paragraph 9(2) is amended so that protection ceases for a full protection member on the earlier of the day on which they leave pensionable service under the existing scheme, or 31st March 2022;
paragraph 31(2) is amended so that no new elections to purchase additional service under the NFPS may be made after 31st March 2022;
paragraphs 37 and 38 are omitted so that members who are awaiting a decision on whether they are entitled to an ill-health award under an existing scheme on 1st April 2022 transition to the 2014 Firefighters’ Scheme on that date.
Regulation 3 amends Schedule 4 to the Police Regulations as follows—
the definitions of “closing date” and “transition date” in paragraph 1 are amended to insert dates in respect of those terms that apply to full protection members so that provisions which refer to those terms operate as intended in respect of such members;
paragraph 9(2) and 12(2) are amended so that protection ceases for a full protection member on the earlier of the day on which they leave pensionable service under the legacy scheme, or 31st March 2022;
paragraph 35(2) is amended to make it clear that the provisions in the existing pension schemes relating to elections for the purchase of increased benefits made under those schemes continue to apply after the member’s closing date (but not so as to allow new elections to be made after that date).

7 March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the County Borough of the Vale of Glamorgan (Electoral Arrangements) Order 2021 (“the 2021 Order”), which implements the recommendations for changes to the electoral arrangements for the County Borough of the Vale of Glamorgan, as contained within the report of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales dated February 2021 (“the Report”).
The Table in the Schedule to the 2021 Order (“the Table”) sets out the electoral arrangements for the County Borough of the Vale of Glamorgan. Each electoral ward comprises the areas specified in column (3) of the Table. The Report mistakenly omitted certain information in relation to the electoral wards of Cowbridge, Dinas Powys, and Sully which led to that information not appearing in column (3) of the Table. Article 2 of this Order rectifies that mistake.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

Regulation 27 of the principal Regulations makes identical provision in respect of Northern Ireland. Paragraph (4) sets out the 3-month residence requirement, with paragraph (5) providing for exceptions to this requirement. Regulations 2(3) of these Regulations amends paragraph (5) of regulations 27 of the principal Regulations to include an identical exception in relation to Northern Ireland.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision that is consequential on section 168 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (c. 32). Section 168 amends section 87 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (c. 42) (“the 2003 Act”) to change the procedural requirements for designating police stations where sex offenders are required to notify. The amended procedure no longer requires the Secretary of State to make regulations prescribing police stations where sex offenders may notify. Instead, the chief officer of police for each police area is required to publish a document containing details of each police station where a sex offender may give the notification under section 83(1), 84(1) or 85(1) of the 2003 Act.
Section 86 of the 2003 Act enables regulations to make provision requiring sex offenders to notify the police of their intention to travel abroad and of their return. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Travel Notification Requirements) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/1220) were made in exercise of that power. Regulation 10 of those regulations enables a sex offender to give details at any police station prescribed by the Secretary of State in England and Wales when giving the further information required by regulation 5(3) or notifying of a change to information already disclosed in a notification under section 86(2) of the 2003 Act as required by regulation 7. Regulation 10 requires consequential amendment to remove the reference to a police station which is “prescribed”, and instead refer to a police station published in a document for each police area by the chief officer of police, where the sex offender may give the required notification.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

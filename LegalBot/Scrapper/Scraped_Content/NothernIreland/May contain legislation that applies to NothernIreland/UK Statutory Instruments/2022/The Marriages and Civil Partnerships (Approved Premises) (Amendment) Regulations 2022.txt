(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Marriages and Civil Partnerships (Approved Premises) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/3168) (the “2005 Regulations”), which make provision for the approval of premises for the solemnization of civil marriages and the formation of civil partnerships (“proceedings”). The amendments made by these Regulations will enable proceedings to take place in outdoor areas in the grounds of premises which have been approved under the 2005 Regulations.
These Regulations introduce amendments similar to temporary changes introduced by the Marriages and Civil Partnerships (Approved Premises) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/775) which came into force on 1st July 2021 and expire at the end of 5th April 2022 (the “2021 Regulations”).
Regulation 3(2) makes amendments to certain definitions in the 2005 Regulations. The definition of “premises” is amended to include the “built premises” together with “linked outdoor areas”. Built premises are defined as “a permanently immovable structure comprising at least a room, or any boat or other vessel which is permanently moored” and linked outdoor areas are defined as “any areas within the boundary of the land of which the built premises form part, which are not built premises and which may be used in common with the built premises”. Prior to the amendments made by these Regulations (and temporarily by the 2021 Regulations), the definition of premises comprised built premises only. Amendments are made to the definitions of “religious premises” and “shared buildings” to clarify that only the built premises must meet the defining criteria. The effect of these changes is that an application for approval made under regulations 3, 3A or 3B of the 2005 Regulations (as the case may be) will be made in respect of both the built premises and linked outdoor areas, and a grant or refusal of an approval by an authority will be given in respect of both the built premises and linked outdoor areas.
Regulation 3(3) makes amendments to regulation 5 of the 2005 Regulations. It amends the condition for approval of a religious premises by an authority such that the requirement to be a building of the type listed in regulation 5(1B) of the 2005 Regulations applies to the built premises only.
Regulation 3(4) makes amendments to regulation 6 of the 2005 Regulations. It provides that the conditions in Schedule 2B or 2C (as the case may be) must be attached to approvals in addition to the conditions in Schedule 2 or 2A (as the case may be). Regulation 3(5) makes amendments to regulation 9 of the 2005 Regulations to clarify that a review may not be requested of a decision to attach to an approval the conditions in Schedule 2B or 2C.
Regulations 3(6) and 3(7) make amendments to Schedules 1 and 1A to the 2005 Regulations respectively. They provide that the requirements of those Schedules continue to apply to the built premises only. Regulations 3(8) and 3(9) make amendments to Schedule 2 and 2A to the 2005 Regulations respectively. They clarify which aspects of those Schedules apply to the built premises only.
Regulation 3(10) inserts a new Schedule 2B of standard conditions to be attached to grants of approval of premises which are not religious premises relating to proceedings held in linked outdoor areas. Regulation 3(11) inserts a new Schedule 2C of standard conditions to be attached to grants of approval of religious premises relating to proceedings held in linked outdoor areas.
Regulation 4 clarifies that nothing in these Regulations is intended to oust the faculty jurisdiction of the Church of England.
Regulations 5 to 9 make transitional provision. Regulations 5 and 6 provide that applications and requests submitted prior to 1st July 2021, and approvals granted prior to that date, have effect as if they were made or granted under the 2005 Regulations as amended by these Regulations subject to certain exceptions. Regulation 7 provides that approvals granted on or after 1st July 2021 in respect of applications made before 1st July 2021 have effect as if granted under the 2005 Regulations as amended by these Regulations subject to certain exceptions. Regulations 8 and 9 provide that applications and requests submitted on or after 1st July 2021, and approvals granted on or after 1st July 2021, have effect as if made or granted under the 2005 Regulations as amended by these Regulations.

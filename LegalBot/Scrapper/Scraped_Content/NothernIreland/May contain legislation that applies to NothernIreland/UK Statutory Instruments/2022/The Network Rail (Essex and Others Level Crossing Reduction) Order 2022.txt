(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 18(7)) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.

“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
Introduction
1.  This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serve a notice to treat in respect of a right over a house, building or factory.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of its decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right,
(b)
the use to be made of the right proposed to be acquired, and
(c)
if the right is proposed to be acquired for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5) and paragraph 8, if, within a reasonable period being not less than 28 days beginning with the date on which a notice in respect of any drainage work is served under sub-paragraph (2) on Network Rail, Network Rail has failed to begin taking steps to comply with the reasonable requirements of the notice and has not subsequently made reasonably expeditious progress towards their implementation, the drainage authority may do what is necessary for such compliance and may recover any expenditure reasonably incurred by it in so doing from Network Rail.

(b)
the failure of any such work,
damage to a fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the drainage authority may serve notice on Network Rail requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage, or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.

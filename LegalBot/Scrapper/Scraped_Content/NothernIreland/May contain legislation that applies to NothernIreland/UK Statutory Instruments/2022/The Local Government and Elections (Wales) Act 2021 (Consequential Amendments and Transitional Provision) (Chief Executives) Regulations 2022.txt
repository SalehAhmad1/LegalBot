22 March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments which are consequential on section 54 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (“the 2021 Act”). Section 54 requires principal councils (county councils and county borough councils) to appoint a chief executive. This requirement replaces the requirement on principal councils to designate one of their officers as head of their paid service under section 4 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 (“the 1989 Act”).
Regulation 9(1) is a transitional provision, which provides that the officer that is designated as the head of the authority’s paid service under section 4 of the 1989 Act immediately before 5 May 2022 is to be treated as the chief executive under section 54 of the 2021 Act. Regulation 9(2) provides that the appointment regime as set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Local Authorities (Standing Orders) (Wales) Regulations 2006 does not apply to heads of paid service treated as chief executives under regulation 9(1).
Regulation 10 revokes regulation 11 of the Local Authorities (Standing Orders) (Wales) Regulations 2006.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

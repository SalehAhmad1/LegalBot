21st November 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, which apply in Great Britain, amend the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/611) (the “2018 Regulations”).
The 2018 Regulations provide for a scheme under which owners of plants which generate heat from specified renewable sources and meet specified criteria, and producers of biomethane for injection, may receive prescribed tariffs for heat used for eligible purposes.
The Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme (Amendment) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1096) (the “2022 Regulations”) made various amendments to the 2018 Regulations. These included amending Schedule 4A to the 2018 Regulations to temporarily disapply for 12 months certain requirements relating to the fuel quality criteria. Due to a drafting error in regulation 6(b) of the 2022 Regulations, the 12-month suspension period purported to commence on the date that the 2018 Regulations came into force (rather than, as had been intended, the date on which the 2022 Regulations came into force). These Regulations amend Schedule 4A to the 2018 Regulations so that the 12-month suspension period commences on the date that these Regulations come into force.
The amendment to Schedule 4A will also affect the Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/928), as the definition of “approved sustainable fuel” in those Regulations references regulation 51 of the 2018 Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

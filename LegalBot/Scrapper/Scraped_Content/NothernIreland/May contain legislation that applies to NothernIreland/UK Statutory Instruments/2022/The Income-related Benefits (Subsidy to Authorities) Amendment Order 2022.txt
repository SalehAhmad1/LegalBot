P is the guideline rent increase specified in column 2 of that Table for the authority;
Q is the average weekly rent for a dwelling for the authority for the relevant year.
(2) For the purposes of determining Q in sub-paragraph (1)(b), the average weekly rent for a dwelling for the authority for the relevant year is calculated by dividing the total rent charged for all dwellings in the HRA in that year by the total number of weeks for which rent was charged for all dwellings in the HRA, disregarding any unoccupied dwelling.
Amount of deduction
3.—(1) The amount of the deduction from subsidy referred to in article 20A(2) is to be calculated as follows—
Step 1
Divide the amount of rebates granted by the authority in the relevant year in respect of dwellings in the HRA by the income of the authority for that year from rent (including rent remitted by way of rebate) in respect of such dwellings.
Step 2
If the result of Step 1—
(a)
does not exceed the rebate proportion for the relevant year (see sub-paragraph (2))—
(i)
deduct (O + P) from Q (see paragraph 2);
(ii)
divide the result of paragraph (a)(i) by Q;
(iii)
multiply the amount of the subsidy (apart from any deduction to be calculated under this Schedule) by the result of paragraph (a)(ii));
(b)
exceeds the rebate proportion for the relevant year—
(i)
deduct (O + P) from Q (see paragraph 2);
(ii)
divide the result of paragraph (b)(i) by Q;
(iii)
divide the rebate proportion (see sub-paragraph (2)) by the result of Step 1;
(iv)
multiply the result of paragraph (b)(ii) by the result of paragraph (b)(iii);
(v)
multiply the amount of the subsidy (apart from any deduction to be calculated under this Schedule) by the result of paragraph (b)(iv).
(2) The rebate proportion for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) for the relevant year beginning with 1st April 2022 is 0.528.

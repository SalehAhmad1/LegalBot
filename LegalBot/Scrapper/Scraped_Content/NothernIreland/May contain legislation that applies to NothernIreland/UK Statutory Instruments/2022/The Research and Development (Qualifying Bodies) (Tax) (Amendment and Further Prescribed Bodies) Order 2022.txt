(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Research and Development (Qualifying Bodies) (Tax) Order 2018 to remove the Lomonosov Moscow State University from the list of prescribed bodes for the purposes of Parts 3 and 13 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009 and prescribe further bodies for those purposes.
Parts 3 and 13 of that Act provide tax credits and reliefs respectively to a company in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on research and development. Qualifying expenditure includes certain expenditure on research and development undertaken on the company’s behalf by “qualifying bodies” and certain expenditure incurred on contributions to independent research carried out by “qualifying bodies”. Section 1142(1) defines qualifying bodies as including bodies prescribed by order. Under section 104Y, the definition of “qualifying body” in section 1142(1) in Part 13 also applies for the purposes of Part 3. The effect of this Order is that the Lomonosov Moscow State University ceases to be a qualifying body and the bodies listed in the Schedule are qualifying bodies for the purpose of Parts 3 and 13 of the Corporation Tax Act 2009. The appropriate tax credit or relief is available in relation to expenditure incurred by the bodies prescribed on or after the date specified in relation to each body.
Authority for this retrospective effect is provided by section 1142(3) and (4) of the Corporation Tax Act 2009 which provides that any order made under section 1142 may have effect in relation to accounting periods beginning, or expenditure incurred, before the time the order is made.
A Tax Information and Impact note has not been prepared for this Instrument as it contains no substantive changes to tax policy.

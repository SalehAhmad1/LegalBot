     EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Combined Authorities (Mayoral Elections) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/67) makes provision for the conduct of elections of combined authority mayors.
Section 13 of the Elections Act 2022 changes the voting system at elections for combined authority mayors in England from the supplementary vote system to the simple majority vote system, also known as “first past the post”. As a consequence of the amendments made by that section to the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 the secondary legislation setting out the rules for the conduct of elections for combined authority mayors requires amending. This Order amends the 2017 Order Rules to replace provisions relating to the supplementary vote system for the election of combined authority mayors with provisions which will provide for the simple majority vote system for those elections. It also makes minor amendments to various references to the combined authority returning officer to ensure consistency.
An impact assessment has been produced for the Elections Act 2022 including an Addendum on the “first past the post” provision. No, or no significant, impact on business, charities or the public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

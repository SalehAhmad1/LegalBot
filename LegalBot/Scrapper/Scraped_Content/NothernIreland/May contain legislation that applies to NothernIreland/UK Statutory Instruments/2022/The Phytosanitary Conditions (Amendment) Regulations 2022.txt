At 11.17 a.m. on 8th February 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 (“the Phytosanitary Conditions Regulation”) establishing uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 of the European Parliament and the Council, as regards protective measures against pests of plants.
Regulation 3 amends the Phytosanitary Conditions Regulation to include pest measures which require urgent implementation and are therefore subject to an earlier commencement date of 2nd March 2022. The regulation includes measures to prevent the introduction of the plant pests Polygraphus proximus and Scolytus morawitzi in Great Britain, including a prohibition, pending a risk assessment, on the introduction of the hosts of these pests: Abies, Pinus, Picea, Larix and Tsuga, originating from Russia. The import and movement requirements for Thaumetopoea processionea are updated to reflect the current situation regarding the pest in Great Britain. The following pests which no longer pose a risk to biosecurity in Great Britain are also deregulated: Aonidiella orientalis and Diaporthe caulivora.
Regulation 4 amends the Phytosanitary Conditions Regulation to include additional pest measures which do not require urgent implementation and are subject to a later commencement date of 8th August 2022. These include adding the following provisional GB quarantine pests to the GB quarantine pest list: Eotetranychus sexmaculatus and Platypus apicalis. The following pests are added to the provisional GB quarantine pest list for the first time: Agrilus horni, Chrysobothris femorata, Lycorma delicatula, Diaporthe phaseolorum var. sojae, Pseudomonas avellanae Meloidogyne arenaria, Meloidogyne enterolobii, Meloidogyne javanica, Xiphinema index and Chilli veinal mottle virus. Updates are also made to the import requirements for Bemisia tabaci, Liriomyza huidobrensis and Liriomyza tifolii, Cronartium spp. and Spodoptera frugiperda.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

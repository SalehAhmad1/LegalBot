Part 2 also makes detailed provision about applications for exemption certificates and dealing in an item in respect of which an exemption certificate was issued to a different person, including the fees payable. Regulations 8 and 9 set out requirements in relation to appeals against a refusal to issue an exemption certificate or against revocation of a certificate.
Part 3 of these Regulations sets out the additional information which must accompany an application under section 10 of the Act (registration) and prescribes the fees payable to the Secretary of State in relation to registration of a single item and to a group registration of a number of items of the same type.

(2) Where a subsidy is given by any other means (except in the form of a tax measure), the gross cash equivalent amount is to be determined by reference to the value of the benefit conferred by the subsidy on an enterprise(1), taking into account the difference between—
(a)
the terms on which the subsidy is given, and
(b)
the terms on which financial assistance of the same kind might reasonably have been expected to have been available on the market to the enterprise.
(3) Where a subsidy is given in the form of a tax measure, the gross cash equivalent is to be determined by reference to the value of the benefit conferred by the subsidy on an enterprise taking into account the difference between—
(a)
the tax liability borne by an enterprise as a result of that tax measure, and

(a)
the subsidy is given in the form of a tax measure, or
(b)
it is not reasonably possible to calculate precisely the gross cash equivalent of the subsidy.
(7) Without prejudice to the generality of regulation 3(1), a determination made in reliance on paragraph 6 may be used, in particular, for the purpose of ascertaining—
(a)
whether a subsidy is a subsidy of interest or a subsidy of particular interest(2),
(b)
the maximum amount of an individual subsidy that may be given under a subsidy scheme, or
(c)
whether a subsidy scheme allows for a subsidy of interest or a subsidy of particular interest to be given under it.
(1)
“enterprise” has the meaning given by section 7 of the Subsidy Control Act 2022. (c. 23).
(2)
“subsidy of interest” and “subsidy of particular interest” have the meanings given in regulations made by the Secretary of State under section 11(1) of the Subsidy Control Act 2022.Supplementary provisions for determining the gross cash equivalent of certain subsidies

8.  Where the subsidy is given by means of a loan to a person with a strong, good or satisfactory level of creditworthiness, the interest rate at which a loan of the same kind might reasonably have been expected to have been available on the market may be calculated by adding—

the relevant base rate, which is determined by identifying the period over which the loan is to be repaid, as set out in Table 1 in Schedule 2, and
(b)
the relevant mark-up rate in the third column of Table 2 in Schedule 2, which is determined by identifying—

Regulation 3 sets out the provisions which these Regulations apply to. These are provisions contained in, or made under, the Act that apply to thresholds or other requirements which are based on the amount of a subsidy determined by reference to its gross cash amount or its gross cash equivalent. Regulation 3 also sets out which types of subsidy are to be valued by reference to their gross cash amount, and which types of subsidy are to be valued by reference to their gross cash equivalent.

Regulation 5 provides that the further supplementary provisions set out in regulations 6 to 9 may be applied when determining the gross cash equivalent of certain types of subsidies, namely small loans, small loan guarantees, and loans or guarantees which relate to persons with a strong, good or satisfactory level of credit worthiness.
Regulations 6 and 7 set out the conditions which a subsidy must meet to qualify as a small loan or a small loan guarantee and provides for such subsidies to be valued at or below £315,000.
Regulation 8 allows for the market interest rate of a loan to a person with a strong, good or satisfactory level of credit worthiness to be determined using the tables in Schedule 2.
Regulation 9 allows for the market premium for a guarantee relating to a person with a strong, good or satisfactory level of credit worthiness to be determined by reference to the table in Schedule 3.

29th August 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends to England and Wales, and amends the Insolvency Proceedings (Fees) Order 2016 to increase the deposit paid when a petition is filed at court, by the petitioner; and brings article 4 of the Order to be interpreted in accordance with the drafting conventions.
Article 2(a) sets out the new deposit, payable to the court as security for the payment of the official receiver’s administration fee, on the presentation of a bankruptcy petition. This Article increases the old fee to £1,500 from £990.
Article 2(b) sets out the new deposit, payable to the court as security for the payment of the official receiver’s administration fee, on the presentation of a winding up petition, other than a petition presented under section 124A of the Insolvency Act 1986. This Article increases the old fee to £2,600 from £1,600.
Article 2(c) deletes the word “will” and substitutes with “must” to make clear it was an obligation and brings Article 4 in line with the drafting conventions.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376) to provide that certain payments made by local government for welfare purposes should be disregarded as capital and therefore not be taken into account for the purposes of calculating entitlement to Universal Credit.
This disregard will apply to such a payment for the period of 12 months from the date the payment is received.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

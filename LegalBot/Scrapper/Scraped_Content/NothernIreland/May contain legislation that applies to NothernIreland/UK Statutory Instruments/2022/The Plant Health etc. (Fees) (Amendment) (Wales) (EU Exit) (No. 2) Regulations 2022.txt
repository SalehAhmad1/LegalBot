(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 7(2) of Schedule 4 and paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16). They amend the Plant Health etc. (Fees) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1179) (W. 238) (“the 2018 Regulations”).
In particular, the 2018 Regulations are amended—
(a)
in relation to the fees payable by an importer of a consignment originating in a third country in respect of a physical check and identity check of plants, plant products or other objects, to reflect the frequency rates of physical checks and identity checks of such plants, plant products and other objects. The amendments include providing for a flat rate fee in respect of certain plants for planting and changes to the categorisation of certain plants, and plant products; and
(b)
to extend the exemption from the payment of fees otherwise payable in respect of certification and pre-export services on consignments in certain circumstances to 31 December 2023.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Paragraph 5(1B) of Schedule 9 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (“the Act”) provides that a county council or county borough council in Wales (a “billing authority”) may serve a notice on certain persons requiring them to supply information in relation to a hereditament in that billing authority’s area. Those persons include a person who is carrying on a business in relation to that hereditament, of a description specified in regulations made by the Welsh Ministers.
These Regulations specify descriptions of the types of business being carried on by a person in relation to a hereditament.
They also make provision as to how a billing authority may effect service of a notice on a person to whom paragraph 5(1D) of Schedule 9 to the Act applies.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

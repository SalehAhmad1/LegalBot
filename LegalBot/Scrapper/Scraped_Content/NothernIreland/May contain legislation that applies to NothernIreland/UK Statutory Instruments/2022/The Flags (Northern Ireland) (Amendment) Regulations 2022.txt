(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 (S.R. 2000/347) (“the Flags Regulations”) make provision as to the flying of flags at government buildings in Northern Ireland, in particular by specifying the buildings on which flags must be flown on certain days. Section 67(2) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c. 26) provides for the Flags Regulations to apply to court houses as they apply to the government buildings specified in Part 1 of the Schedule.
These Regulations amend the Flags Regulations so as to provide that the Union flag need not be flown on the designated days listed in Part 2 of the Schedule to those Regulations where those days relate to a member of the Royal Family who has died. They also provide for the flying of the Union flag at full mast following the accession of a new monarch: the days and times when the flag has to be flown will be consistent with formal guidance issued in respect of United Kingdom government buildings in the rest of the United Kingdom.
The Regulations remove, from the list in Part 2 of the Schedule to the Flags Regulations (days on which the Union flag must be flown), the entries for the birthday of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh and Her Majesty’s wedding day.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

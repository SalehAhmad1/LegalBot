(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the National Health Service (Performers Lists) (England) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/335) (“the 2013 Regulations”).
Regulation 3 substitutes the definition of “contractor” in regulation 29(1) of the 2013 Regulations so as to include persons who have entered into agreements for the provision of primary dental services in accordance with section 107 arrangements (arrangements for the provision of primary dental services).
Regulation 4 amends the definition of “foundation training” in regulation 30(1) of the 2013 Regulations to reflect changes to the employers of dental foundation trainees.
Regulation 5 further amends regulation 30 to make provision in relation to dental practitioners who were not employed by “approved trainers” (as defined in regulation 29(1) of the 2013 Regulations) but were supervised by approved trainers during their training period.

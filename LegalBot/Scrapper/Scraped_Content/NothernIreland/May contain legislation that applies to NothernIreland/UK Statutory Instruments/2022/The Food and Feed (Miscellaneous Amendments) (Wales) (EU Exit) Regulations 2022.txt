Maximum levels refer to an analytical determination of fluorine, whereby extraction is performed with hydrochloric acid 1 N for 20 minutes at ambient temperature. Equivalent extraction procedures can be applied for which it can be demonstrated that the used extraction procedure has an equal extraction efficiency.
(6)
For the determination of lead in kaolinitic clay and in feed containing kaolinitic clay, the maximum level refers to an analytical determination of lead, whereby extraction is performed in nitric acid (5% w/w) for 30 minutes at boiling temperature.

Undesirable substances Products intended for animal feed Action threshold in ng WHO-PCDD/F TEQ/kg (ppt)(1) relative to a feedingstuff with a moisture content of 12% Comments and additional information (e.g. nature of investigations to be performed)
(1)
Upper-bound concentrations; upper-bound concentrations are calculated on the assumption that all values of the different congeners below the limit of quantification are equal to the limit of quantification.
(2)
See Table 1 (part 2) for TEFs (= toxic equivalency factors) for dioxins, furans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): WHO-TEFs for human risk assessment based on the conclusions of the World Health Organisation (WHO) – International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) expert meeting which was held in Geneva in June 2005 (Martin van den Berg et al., The 2005 World Health Organisation Re-evaluation of Human and Mammalian Toxic Equivalency Factors for Dioxins and Dioxin-like Compounds. Toxicological Sciences 93(2), 223–241 (2006)).
(3)
Identification of source of contamination. Once source is identified, take appropriate measures, where possible, to reduce or eliminate source of contamination.
(4)
In many cases it might not be necessary to perform an investigation into the source of contamination as the background level in some areas is close to or above the action level. However, in cases where the action level is exceeded, all information, such as sampling period, geographical origin, fish species etc., must be recorded with a view to future measures to manage the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in these materials for animal nutrition.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are principally made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2, and paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7, to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulations 4(2)(a)(ii) and 5(2)(a) are made in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 66(1), 74A(1) and 84 of the Agriculture Act 1970, in order to correct existing errors.
These Regulations make amendments to various Welsh statutory instruments relating to food and feed. In particular, the amendments remove cross-references to EU Directives and transpose certain Annexes to those Directives, as they had effect immediately before implementation period completion day (11.00 p.m., 31 December 2020), as new Schedules to the instruments concerned.
Regulation 2 (and Schedule 1) amends the Materials and Articles in Contact with Food (Wales) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/2705 (W. 291)). In particular, Annex 2 to Directive 2007/42/EC relating to materials and articles made of regenerated cellulose film intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (OJ No L 172, 30.6.2007, p. 71–82) is transposed into the Regulations as a new Schedule 6.
Regulation 3 (and Schedule 2) amends the Food Additives, Flavourings, Enzymes and Extraction Solvents (Wales) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/2591 (W. 255)). In particular, Annex 1 to Directive 2009/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on extraction solvents used in the production of foodstuffs and food ingredients (OJ No L 141, 6.6.2009, p. 3–11) is transposed into the Regulations as a new Schedule 4A.
Regulation 4 (and Schedule 3) amends the Animal Feed (Composition, Marketing and Use) (Wales) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/386 (W. 120)). In particular—
the Annex to Commission Directive 82/475/EEC laying down the categories of feed materials which may be used for the purposes of labelling compound feedingstuffs for pet animals (OJ No L 213, 21.7.1982, p. 27–28) is transposed into the Regulations as a new Schedule 1A;
Annexes 1 and 2 to Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on undesirable substances in animal feed (OJ No L 140, 30.5.2002, p. 10–22) are transposed into the Regulations as new Schedules 1B and 1C;
the tertiary legislation-making powers of the EU Commission in Articles 7 and 8 of Directive 2002/32/EC to amend the lists of undesirable substances in Annexes 1 and 2 that Directive, and to define acceptability criteria for detoxification processes, are retained. Regulation 4(8) inserts a new Regulation 15A into the Regulations, conferring corresponding regulation-making powers on the Welsh Ministers, exercisable in relation to Wales.
Regulation 5 makes minor amendments to the Animal Feed (Hygiene, Sampling etc. and Enforcement) (Wales) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/387 (W. 121)).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

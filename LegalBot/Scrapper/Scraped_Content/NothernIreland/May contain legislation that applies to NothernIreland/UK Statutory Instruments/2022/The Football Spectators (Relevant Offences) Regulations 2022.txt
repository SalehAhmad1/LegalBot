9th November 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Schedule 1 to the Football Spectators Act 1989 (c. 37) to add the offences of supply and possession of Class A drugs to the list of relevant offences that may prompt a court to issue a banning order. A banning order, made under section 14A of that Act, prevents the person who is subject to the order from entering premises in England and Wales for the purpose of attending a regulated football match, as prescribed in article 3 of the Football Spectators (Prescription) Order 2022 (S.I. 2022/617).
These Regulations do not apply to an offence committed before the day the Regulations come into force.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary, or public sector is foreseen.

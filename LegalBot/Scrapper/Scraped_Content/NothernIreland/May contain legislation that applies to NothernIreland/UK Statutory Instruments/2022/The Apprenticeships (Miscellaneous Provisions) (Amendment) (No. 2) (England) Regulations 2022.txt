(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Apprenticeships (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/1310) (“the 2017 Regulations”) to allow alternative English apprenticeship arrangements to be made in respect of certain categories of persons who are detained in prison or similar premises.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends regulation 6 of the 2017 Regulations so as to allow alternative English apprenticeships to be made in respect of—
(a)
convicted and sentenced civilian prisoners (i.e. excluding military prisoners),
(b)
convicted and sentenced inmates in young offender institutions (Rule 2 of the Young Offender Institution Rules 2000 (S.I. 2000/3371) defines “inmate” as a person who is required to be detained in a young offender institution), and
(c)
other convicted and sentenced persons who are required to be detained in certain types of accommodation e.g. secure children’s homes, secure training centres, a secure 16 to 19 Academy.
These persons can continue such apprenticeships after being released so long as the apprenticeship started while the person was a prisoner, inmate or other person referred to in new regulation 6(10).
These Regulations, in regulation 2(3), also correct an error in the Apprenticeships (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/86) by deleting the definition of “an approved standard” as the definition of that phrase is to be found in the enabling Act (section A1(7) of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009 (c. 22)).
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as this instrument has no impact on the costs of business and the voluntary sector.

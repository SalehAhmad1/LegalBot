18th July 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of these Regulations)
The primary purpose of this instrument is to make amendments to legislation that are consequential on changes made by sections 1 to 5 of, and Schedules 1 to 4 to, the Financial Services Act 2021 (c. 22). These provisions relate to the prudential regulation of credit institutions and investment firms.
This instrument also addresses failures of retained EU law to operate effectively, and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Part 2 of this instrument makes amendments to primary legislation, Scottish legislation and Northern Ireland legislation. In particular, regulation 7 amends the definition of “investment firm” in the Banking Act 2009 such that specified liabilities owed to PRA-regulated and FCA-regulated investment firms are kept within the exclusion from the bail-in power.
Part 3 of this instrument makes amendments to secondary legislation.
Part 4 of this instrument makes amendments to retained direct EU legislation.
Part 5 of this instrument makes transitional provision in respect of certain securitisations relating to the retention of a material net economic interest by the originator, sponsor or original lender.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. A de minimis impact assessment was produced for the Financial Services Act 2021 (Prudential Regulation of Credit Institutions and Investment Firms) (Consequential Amendments and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2021 which these Regulations follow. The impact of these Regulations is accounted for in that de minimis assessment, a copy of which is available from HM Treasury, 1 Horse Guards Road, London, SW1A 2HQ and was published with the Explanatory Memorandum for that instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

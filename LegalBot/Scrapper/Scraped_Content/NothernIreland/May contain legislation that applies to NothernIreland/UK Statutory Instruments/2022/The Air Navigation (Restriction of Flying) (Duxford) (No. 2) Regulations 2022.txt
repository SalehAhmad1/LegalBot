EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Duxford Aerodrome, 
Cambridgeshire during air displays and rehearsals that are scheduled to take place there on 7th and 
8th October 2022. A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during 
the displays and therefore the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree 
that flying should be restricted in the vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2), the Duxford Aerodrome flying display 
director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr S J Maxted, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 383216.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Southport, Merseyside during air 
displays that are scheduled to take place between 7th July 2022 and 10th July 2022 (inclusive). 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the 
Civil Aviation Authority and Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in the 
vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2), the Flying Display Director of the 
Southport Airshow may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr S J Maxted, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 383216.

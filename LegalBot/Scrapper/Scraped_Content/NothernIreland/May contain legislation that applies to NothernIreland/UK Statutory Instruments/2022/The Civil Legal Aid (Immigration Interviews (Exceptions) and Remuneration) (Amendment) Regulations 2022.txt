19th December 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend two statutory instruments relating to the provision of civil legal services under Part 1 of the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (c.10) (“the Act”) as a result of changes required to be made because of the coming into force of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 (c.36) and because of a new online procedure created by Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service (“HMCTS”) in relation to cases in the Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the First Tier Tribunal. These Regulations also make some minor and insubstantial corrections to the Civil Legal Aid (Remuneration) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/422) (“the Remuneration Regulations”).
Regulation 2 amends the Civil Legal Aid (Immigration Interviews) (Exceptions) Regulations 2012 (S.I. 2012/2683) (“the Immigration Interviews (Exceptions) Regulations”). Paragraph 30 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Act sets out the scope of civil legal services within which civil legal aid may be made available in relation to an individual’s rights to enter and remain in the United Kingdom under certain specified provisions. Paragraph 30(3) of Part 1 of the Schedule provides that such services do not include attendance at an immigration interview conducted on behalf of the Secretary of State with a view to reaching a decision on a claim, except where regulations provide otherwise. The Immigration Interviews (Exceptions) Regulations provide exceptions to paragraph 30(3).
Regulation 2 makes it clear that civil legal aid is to be made available to cover attendance at an immigration interview and at a screening interview where the individual being interviewed is under the age of 18 or is being treated as such for the purposes of the interview. This was always the intention of the Immigration Interviews (Exceptions) Regulations and the intention is merely clarificatory.
It also removes a list of three named Removal Centres at which work under paragraph 30(1) of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Act is required to be carried out. The list of three Removal Centres was added by the Civil Legal Aid (Immigration Interviews) (Exceptions) (Amendment) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/192). Regulation 3 replaces the list with reference to the definition of a Removal Centre in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (c.33) in order to ensure that the provision is applicable to all existing and future Removal Centres.
Regulations 3 and 4 amend the Remuneration Regulations, which make provision about payment by the Lord Chancellor to providers of civil legal services under arrangements made for the purpose of Part 1 of the Act.
Regulation 4 adds four new fees to remunerate legal aid providers for work they are now required to carry out through HMCTS’s new online procedure and adds a new additional fixed fee for providers who provide advice on referral into the National Referral Mechanism (“NRM”). Legal aid in relation to advice on the NRM is a new in scope service introduced by the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.
Regulations 3 and 4 also correct a previous oversight by adding in reference to the 2016 Standard Civil Contract (Welfare Benefits) and the 2018 Standard Civil Contract.
Regulation 4 also makes a number of minor and insubstantial corrections to the Remuneration Regulations, for example, correcting fees which are currently “per hour” where they should be “per item”.

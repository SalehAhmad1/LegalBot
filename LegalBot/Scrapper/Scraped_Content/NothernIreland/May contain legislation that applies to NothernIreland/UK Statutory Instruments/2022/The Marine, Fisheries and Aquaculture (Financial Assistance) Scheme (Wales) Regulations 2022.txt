(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations establish the Scheme for the giving of grants and making of loans by the Welsh Ministers under paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 to the Fisheries Act 2020 (c. 22).
Paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 6 to the Fisheries Act 2020 specifies the purposes for which financial assistance can be given.
Part 1 of these Regulations contains general introductory provisions. Part 2 provides for the establishment of the Scheme. Part 3 constitutes the Scheme and makes provision for the payment of grants and the making of loans by the Welsh Ministers. The Welsh Ministers may pay grants or make loans in respect of the activities listed in the Schedule to these Regulations.
These Regulations set out the basis on which the Welsh Ministers may pay grants and make loans and lays down a procedure for applications. Payment of a grant or loan is dependent on the Welsh Ministers being satisfied as to the expenditure incurred, or to be incurred, and as to compliance with any conditions of approval.
These Regulations also provide that payment of a grant or loan is conditional on the applicant retaining relevant records and notifying the Welsh Ministers of any material change in circumstances. The Welsh Ministers have the ability to vary, suspend and revoke the approval of an application for a grant or loan and may, by notice, require the repayment of a grant or loan if certain conditions are not satisfied (with any sums outstanding ultimately recoverable as a civil debt).
Representations may be made in respect of decisions relating to applications for grants and loans and notices of variation, suspension and revocations. The Welsh Ministers must notify the applicant of their decision following such representations.
These Regulations confer an enforcement function on marine enforcement officers appointed by the Welsh Ministers under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (c. 23). The function is for the enforcement of any potential offences committed in relation to an application for a grant or loan under the Scheme (for example, an offence under the Fraud Act 2006 (c. 35)). Relevant enforcement powers for marine enforcement officers under Part 8 of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 are also applied for the purposes of this function.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ and is published on www.gov.wales.

16 February 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee Regulations 2021 (“the South East Wales Establishment Regulations”), to postpone the date on which certain functions will be conferred on the South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee.
The South East Wales Establishment Regulations were made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (“the 2021 Act”) and established the South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee.
The South East Wales Establishment Regulations also conferred the following functions on the South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee with effect from 28 February 2022 (the commencement date for most of the remainder of those Regulations being 1 April 2021)—
the economic well-being function (as to which, see section 76 of the 2021 Act);
developing transport policies under Part 2 of the Transport Act 2000;
the preparation of a strategic development plan (as to which, see Part 6 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004).
These Regulations amend the South East Wales Establishment Regulations so that the functions mentioned above will be conferred on the South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee with effect from 30 June 2022, instead of from 28 February 2022.
These Regulations also omit from regulation 1(3)(d) of the South East Wales Establishment Regulations the reference to regulation 11 of those Regulations, in consequence of the substitution of regulation 15 of those Regulations by regulation 36(7) of the Corporate Joint Committees (General) (No. 2) (Wales) Regulations 2021. Regulation 15 now contains a disapplication of the power to delegate functions rather than a power to delegate (as to the latter, see regulation 13 of the Corporate Joint Committees (General) (No. 2) (Wales) Regulations 2021, which came into force on 3 December 2021).
A regulatory impact assessment was prepared at the time of making the South East Wales Establishment Regulations and a copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

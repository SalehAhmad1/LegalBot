(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Mandatory Travel Concession (England) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1121) (the “2011 Regulations”).
The 2011 Regulations make provision for the reimbursement arrangements between travel concession authorities and operators of public passenger transport services providing concessions under section 145A (England: mandatory concession for journeys not beginning on the London bus network) of the Transport Act 2000 (c. 38). The Mandatory Travel Concession (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/205) (the “2021 Regulations”) temporarily removed the requirement in the 2011 Regulations that it must be an objective of a travel concession authority when formulating reimbursement arrangements that the operator is no better off as a result of providing a concession. The amendment made by the 2021 Regulations only has effect until the end of 5th April 2022. These Regulations extend the amendment made by the 2021 Regulations until the end of 5th April 2023. After that date the requirement will be reinstated.

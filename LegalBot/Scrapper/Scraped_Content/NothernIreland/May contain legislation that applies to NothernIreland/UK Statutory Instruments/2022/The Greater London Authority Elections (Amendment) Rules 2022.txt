(This note is not part of the Rules)
The Greater London Authority Elections Rules 2007, S.I. 2007/3541, (“the 2007 Rules”) make provision for the conduct of elections to the Greater London Authority (elections for the return of the Mayor of London and of constituency and London members of the London Assembly).
Section 13 of the Elections Act 2022 changes the voting system at elections for the Mayor of London in England from the supplementary vote system to the simple majority vote system, also kown as “first past the post”. As a consequence of the amendments made by that section to the Greater London Authority Act 1999 the secondary legislation setting out the rules for the conduct of elections for the Mayor of London require amending. These Rules amend the 2007 Rules to replace provisions relating to the supplementary vote system for the election of the Mayor of London with provisions which provide for simple majority voting for those elections.
An impact assessment has been produced for the Elections Act 2022 including an Addendum on the “first past the post” provision. No, or no significant, impact on business, charities or the public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

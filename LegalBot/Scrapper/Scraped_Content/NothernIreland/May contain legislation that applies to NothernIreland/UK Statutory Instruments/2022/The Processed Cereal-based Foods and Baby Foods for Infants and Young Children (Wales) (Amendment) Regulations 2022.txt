14 December 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Processed Cereal-based Foods and Baby Foods for Infants and Young Children (Wales) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/314 (W. 32)) (“the 2004 Regulations”), which prohibit the sale of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children, unless they comply with the manufacturing, compositional and labelling requirements set out in those Regulations.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends Schedule 4 to the 2004 Regulations to permit the addition of calcium-L-methylfolate, ferrous bisglycinate and zinc chloride in the manufacture of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods. The amendments to Schedule 4 also bring those nutritional substances within the scope of the labelling requirements set out in regulation 8(2) and (3) of the 2004 Regulations.
The Welsh Ministers’ code of practice on the carrying out of regulatory impact assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

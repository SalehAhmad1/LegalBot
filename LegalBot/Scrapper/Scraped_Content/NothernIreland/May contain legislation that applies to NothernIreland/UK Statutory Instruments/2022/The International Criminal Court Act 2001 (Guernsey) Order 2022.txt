(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends to the Bailiwick of Guernsey specified provisions of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 (c. 17) (“the 2001 Act”) subject to the modifications set out in the Schedule.
In particular, section 23(5) of the 2001 Act enables United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions which might, depending on their wording, override any immunities attaching to representatives of all States, including non-parties, to be implemented in the Bailiwick, where the UNSC refers a situation to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for investigation and prosecution. Section 44 of the 2001 Act enables the transfer of prisoners between the United Kingdom and the Bailiwick to serve the remainder of an ICC sentence. Section 45 of the 2001 Act provides for the temporary transfer of a prisoner in custody between the United Kingdom jurisdictions and the Bailiwick for the purpose, for example, of attending criminal proceedings against that prisoner.

These Regulations provide for a payment made from the Energy Rebate Scheme 2022 to be disregarded as capital and therefore not taken into account for the purposes of calculating entitlement to Universal Credit.
This disregard will apply to such a payment for the period of 12 months from the date the payment is received.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

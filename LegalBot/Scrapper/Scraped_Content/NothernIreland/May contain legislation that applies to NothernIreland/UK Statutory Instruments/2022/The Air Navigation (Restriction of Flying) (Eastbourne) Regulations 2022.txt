air displays that are scheduled to take place there from 17th August 2022 to 21st August 2022,

The times mentioned in regulation 3(2) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(3), the Eastbourne International Air Show 
flying display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM).

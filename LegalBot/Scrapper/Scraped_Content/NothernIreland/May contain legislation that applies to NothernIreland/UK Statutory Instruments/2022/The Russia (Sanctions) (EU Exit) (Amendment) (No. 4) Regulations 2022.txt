(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) to amend the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the 2019 Regulations”). These Regulations provide for new shipping sanctions measures in relation to Russia.
The Regulations prohibit Russian ships, and other ships specified by the Secretary of State, from entering ports in the United Kingdom. There is a notification and publicity requirement where the specification power is used. The Regulations provide the Secretary of State with a power to control the movement of Russian ships or specified ships by requiring them to leave or enter specified ports, proceed to a specified place or remain where they are. The Regulations also confer powers on the Secretary of State and harbour authorities to detain Russian ships or specified ships at ports or anchorages. The registration of ships on the UK Ship Register is prohibited where they are owned, controlled, chartered or operated by a designated person or persons connected with Russia, or where they are a specified ship.
An exception from the prohibition on port entry is provided for where access or entry is needed by the ship in case of emergency. The Regulations make it a criminal offence to contravene any of the prohibitions in these Regulations.
A consequential amendment is also made to the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993/3138) so that the Registrar General of Shipping and Seamen can refuse to register sanctioned ships and can terminate the registration of sanctioned ships on receipt of a termination direction from the Secretary of State.
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations. An impact assessment was, however, produced for the primary legislation and can be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sanctions-and-anti-money-laundering-bill-impact-assessment.

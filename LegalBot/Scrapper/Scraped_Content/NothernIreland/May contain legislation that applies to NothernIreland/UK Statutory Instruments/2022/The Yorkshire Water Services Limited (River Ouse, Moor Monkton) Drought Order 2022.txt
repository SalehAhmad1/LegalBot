25th October 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, made on the application of Yorkshire Water Services Limited (“the Company”), makes provision to meet a threatened serious deficiency of supply in the Company’s area of supply, which arises from an exceptional shortage of rain. In accordance with section 74(3) of the Water Resources Act 1991 (c. 57), this Order will cease to have effect on 25th April 2023 (within six months of the day on which the Order comes into force).
The abstraction licence numbered NE/027/0024/065 currently authorises the Canal & River Trust to abstract a maximum quantity of water for specified time periods: 12,500 cubic metres per hour; 300,000 cubic metres per day; and 73,000,000 cubic metres per year.
The abstraction licence numbered 2/27/24/158 currently authorises the Company to abstract a maximum quantity of water for specified time periods: 4.125 megalitres per hour; 99 megalitres per day; and 36,135 megalitres per year.
Both licences contain provisions under which, at times of reduced river flow, the respective maximum abstraction limits are reduced.
The effect of article 3 of this Order is to modify the conditions in the Canal & River Trust’s abstraction licence so that the volume of water that the Trust is authorised to abstract at times of reduced river flow is increased to between 70 and 210 megalitres per day, depending on circumstances.
The effect of article 4 of this Order is to modify the conditions in the Company’s abstraction licence so that the volume of water that the Company is authorised to abstract at times of reduced river flow is increased to between 70 and 210 megalitres per day, depending on circumstances.
Article 5 imposes conditions on the Company in respect of environmental monitoring and remediation which expire when the Order ceases to have effect.
Article 6 provides that the modifications made by this Order are not to be taken as authorising any environmental damage for the purposes of the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (England) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/810) (and accordingly, the Company may not rely on this Order to support grounds for an appeal against a notice relating to remediation of environmental damage).
The abstraction licences, the document entitled “Yorkshire Water’s Drought Plan 2022: Updated Environmental Monitoring Plan” dated September 2022 and Appendix A.5 to that document are available for public inspection at the Environment Agency, Lateral House, 8 City Walk, Leeds LS11 9AT.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

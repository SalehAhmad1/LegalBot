10 August 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in consequence of the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”). The 2018 Act reforms the law on education and training for children and young people with additional learning needs and renames the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales as the Education Tribunal for Wales.
These Regulations make consequential amendments to secondary legislation. Regulation 7 revokes Regulations made under powers which are amended so as no longer to apply in relation to Wales or are repealed by, respectively, sections 57 and 58 of the 2018 Act. The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 (Commencement No. 2) Order 2021 (S.I. 2021/373 (W. 116) (C. 12)), article 8 brings sections 57 and 58 into force on 1 September 2021, which is the same day that these Regulations come into force.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Protection of Wrecks (RMS Titanic) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/2496) (“the 2003 Order”). The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the restriction on activities aimed at the artefacts from RMS Titanic found outside the hull covers all activities, whether or not those activities relate to the conservation or curation of artefacts.
The 2003 Order gives effect to the Agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and France, concerning the shipwrecked vessel RMS Titanic which came into force on 18th November 2019 and the 2003 Order came into force on the same date.
The Agreement concerning the shipwrecked vessel RMS Titanic was published in Cm. 5798.

.]EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order prescribes forms, and forms of wording, for use at a police and crime commissioner (“PCC”) election taking place in Wales. The Welsh versions of the forms of words prescribed by article 3, the Welsh versions of the forms prescribed by article 4, and the Welsh and English versions of the forms prescribed by article 5 are translations of corresponding English wording that is contained in the Police and Crime Commissioner Elections Order 2012 (S.I. 2012/1917). The Welsh versions are to be available for use in any election of police and crime commissioners which takes place in Wales.
In Schedule 1, Part 1A sets out the Welsh version of the notice for the guidance of voters that is appropriate for use in a case where there are three or more candidates standing in the election, and Part 1B sets out the Welsh version of the notice for the guidance of voters that is appropriate for use in a case where there are only 2 candidates standing in the election.
Part 2 of Schedule 1 sets out the Welsh version of the questions to be put to voters. The effect of article 3(2) is that the Welsh version is to be used for any voter who prefers to communicate in Welsh rather than English.
Article 4 and Schedule 2 prescribe forms in Welsh only, which are to be used where the person completing the form prefers to communicate in Welsh rather than English.
Article 5 and Schedule 3 prescribe forms in Welsh and English, which are to be used in this bilingual form in place of the English only versions.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside this Order on www.legislation.gov.uk.

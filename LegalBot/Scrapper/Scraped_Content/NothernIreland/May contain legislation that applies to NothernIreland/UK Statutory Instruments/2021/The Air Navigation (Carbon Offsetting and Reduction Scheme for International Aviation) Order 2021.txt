SCHEDULE 2
Fuel use monitoring methods
Introduction
1.—(1) The procedures specified in this Schedule are concerned with the monitoring of fuel use by aeroplane operators. The methods proposed are representative of the most accurate established practices.
(2) Any equivalent procedures to those contained in this Schedule must only be allowed after prior application to and approval by the Regulator for the aeroplane operator concerned.

Sch. 2 para. 1 in force at 26.5.2021, see art. 1
Fuel Use Monitoring Methods
2.  The aeroplane operator, with the exception of an aeroplane operator eligible to use the CERT, must choose from the following Fuel Use Monitoring Methods—
(a)
Method A,
(b)
Method B,
(c)
Block-off/Block-on,
(d)
Fuel Uplift, or
(e)
Fuel Allocation with Block Hour.

I2
Sch. 2 para. 2 in force at 26.5.2021, see art. 1
Method A
3.—(1) The aeroplane operator must use the following formula to compute fuel use according to Method A(1)—
where—
FN = Fuel used for the flight under consideration (i.e. flight N) determined using Method A (in tonnes);
TN = Amount of fuel contained in aeroplane tanks once fuel uplifts for the flight under consideration (i.e. flight N) are complete (in tonnes);
TN+1 = Amount of fuel contained in aeroplane tanks once fuel uplifts for the subsequent flight (i.e. flight N+1) are complete (in tonnes); and
UN+1 = Sum of fuel uplifts for the subsequent flight (i.e. flight N+1) measured in volume and multiplied with a density value (in tonnes)(2).
(2) The aeroplane operator performing on an ad-hoc basis flights attributed to another aeroplane operator must provide to the latter the fuel measurement values according to the Block-off/Block-on method.
(3) Where no fuel uplift for the flight or subsequent flight takes place, the amount of fuel contained in aeroplane tanks (TN or TN+1) must be determined at block-off for the flight or subsequent flight. In exceptional cases the variable TN+1 cannot be determined. This is the case when an aeroplane performs activities other than a flight, including undergoing major maintenance involving the emptying of the tanks, after the flight to be monitored. In such case the aeroplane operator may substitute the quantity “TN+1 + UN+1” with the amount of fuel remaining in tanks at the start of the subsequent activity of the aeroplane or fuel in tanks at Block-on, as recorded by technical logs.
Commencement Information
I3
Sch. 2 para. 3 in force at 26.5.2021, see art. 1
Method B
4.—(1) The aeroplane operator must use the following formula to compute fuel use according to Method B(3)—
where—
FN = Fuel used for the flight under consideration (i.e. flight N) determined using Method B (in tonnes);
RN–1 = Amount of fuel remaining in aeroplane tanks at the end of the previous flight (i.e. flight N-1) at Block-on before the flight under consideration (in tonnes);
RN = Amount of fuel remaining in aeroplane tanks at the end of the flight under consideration (i.e. flight N) at Block-on after the flight (in tonnes); and
UN = Fuel uplift for the flight considered measured in volume and multiplied with a density value (in tonnes)(4)(5).
(2) The aeroplane operator performing on an ad-hoc basis flights attributed to another aeroplane operator must provide to the latter the fuel measurement values according to the Block-off/Block-on method.
(3) Where an aeroplane does not perform a flight previous to the flight for which fuel consumption is being monitored (e.g., if the flight follows a major revision or maintenance), the aeroplane operator may substitute the quantity RN-1 with the amount of fuel remaining in the aeroplane’s tanks at the end of the previous activity of the aeroplane, as recorded by technical logs.

Sch. 2 para. 4 in force at 26.5.2021, see art. 1
Block-off/Block-on
5.  The aeroplane operator must use the following formula to compute fuel use according to the Block-off/Block-on Method(6)—
where—
FN = Fuel used for the flight under consideration (i.e. flight N) determined using Block-off/Block-on Method (in tonnes);
TN = Amount of fuel contained in aeroplane tanks at Block-off for the flight under consideration i.e. flight N (in tonnes); and
RN = Amount of fuel remaining in aeroplane tanks at Block-on of the flight under consideration i.e. flight N (in tonnes).

Sch. 2 para. 5 in force at 26.5.2021, see art. 1
Fuel Uplift
6.—(1) For flights with a fuel uplift, unless the subsequent flight has no uplift the aeroplane operator must use the following formula to compute fuel use according to the Fuel Uplift Method(7)—
where—
FN = Fuel used for the flight under consideration (i.e. flight N) determined using fuel uplift (in tonnes); and
UN = Fuel uplift for the flight considered, measured in volume and multiplied with a density value (in tonnes)(8).
(2) For flight(s) without a fuel uplift (i.e. flight N+1, …, flight N+n), the aeroplane operator must use the following formula to allocate fuel use from the prior fuel uplift (i.e. from flight N) proportionally to block hour—

Fuel Allocation with Block Hour(10)
7.—(1) For fuel allocation with block hour, the following calculation methods apply.
Calculation of average fuel burn ratios
(2) For an aeroplane operator which can clearly distinguish between international and domestic fuel uplifts, the aeroplane operator must compute, for each aeroplane type, the average fuel burn ratios by summing up all actual fuel uplifts from international flights, divided by the sum of all actual block hours from international flights for a given year, according to the following formula—
where—
AFBRAO,AT = Average fuel burn ratios for aeroplane operator (AO) and aeroplane type (AT) (in tonnes per hour);
UAO,AT,N = Fuel uplifted for the international flight N for aeroplane operator (AO) and aeroplane type (AT) determined using monitoring method Fuel Uplift (in tonnes); and
BHAO,AT,N = Block hour for the international flight N for aeroplane operator (AO) and aeroplane type (AT) (in hours).
(3) For an aeroplane operator which cannot clearly distinguish between international and domestic fuel uplifts, the aeroplane operator must compute, for each aeroplane type, the average fuel burn ratios by summing up all actual fuel uplifts from international and domestic flights divided by the sum of all actual block hours from these flights for a given year, according to the following formula—
where—
AFBRAO,AT = Average fuel burn ratios for aeroplane operator (AO) and aeroplane type (AT) (in tonnes per hour);
UAO,AT,N = Fuel uplifted for the international or a domestic flight N for aeroplane operator (AO) and aeroplane type (AT) measured in volume and multiplied with a specific density value (in tonnes)(11); and
BHAO,AT,N = Block hour for the international and domestic flight N for aeroplane operator (AO) and aeroplane type (AT) (in hours).
(4) An aeroplane operator’s specific average fuel burn ratios must be calculated on a yearly basis by using the yearly data from the actual reporting year. The average fuel burn ratios must be reported, for each aeroplane type, in the aeroplane operator’s Emissions Report.
Calculation of fuel use for individual flights
(5) The aeroplane operator must compute the fuel consumption for each international flight by multiplying the aeroplane operator specific average fuel burn ratios with the flight’s block hour according to the following formula—
where—
FN = Fuel allocated to the international flight under consideration (i.e. flight N) using the Fuel Allocation Block Hour method (in tonnes);
AFBRAO,AT = Average fuel burn ratios for aeroplane operator (AO) and aeroplane type (AT) (in tonnes per hour)(12)(13); and
BHAO,AT,N = Block hour for the international flight under consideration (i.e. flight N) for aeroplane operator (AO) and aeroplane type (AT) (in hours).
(6) A verification body must cross-check whether the emissions reported are reasonable in comparison to other fuel related data of the aeroplane operator.
[F1(7) Average Fuel Burn Ratio (AFBR) based on all flights for a reporting year must be rounded to at least three decimal places.]

For ensuring completeness of the data, it is important to note that not only data generated during the flight under consideration (i.e. flight N) is needed, but also data generated from the previous flight (i.e. flight N-1). This is in particular important when a domestic flight is followed by an international one, or vice versa. For avoiding data gaps, it is therefore recommended that, the amount of fuel remaining in the tank after the flight or the amount of fuel in the tank after fuel uplift is always recorded on flights of aeroplanes which are used for international flights. For the same reasons, fuel uplift data for all flights of those aeroplanes should be collected, before deciding which flights are international.

ISO standard
(2) The verification team must conduct the verification according to ISO 14064-3:2006, and the following additional requirements.
Level of assurance(15)
(3) A reasonable level of assurance must be required for all verifications under this Order.
Objectives(16)
(4) When conducting the verification of an Emissions Report, the verification body must perform sufficient procedures to conclude whether—
(a)
the greenhouse gas assertion is materially fair and an accurate representation of emissions over the period of the Emissions Report and is supported by sufficient and appropriate evidence,
(b)
the aeroplane operator has monitored, quantified and reported its emissions over the period of the Emissions Report in accordance with this Order and the approved Emissions Monitoring Plan,
(c)
the aeroplane operator has correctly applied the method of flight attribution documented in the approved Emissions Monitoring Plan and in accordance with articles 8 and 9 to ensure a correct attribution of leased aeroplane and international flights, operated by other aeroplane operators under the same corporate structure,
(d)
the stated amount of emissions reductions from the use of CORSIA eligible fuels is materially fair and an accurate representation of emissions reductions over the reporting period, and is supported by sufficient and appropriate internal and external evidence,
(e)
the claimed batches of CORSIA eligible fuels have not also been claimed by the aeroplane operator under any other voluntary or mandatory schemes it has participated in, where the emissions reductions from CORSIA eligible fuels may be claimed, during the current compliance period, as well as the compliance period immediately preceding it, and
(f)
the aeroplane operator has monitored, calculated and reported its emissions reductions associated with the use of CORSIA eligible fuels over the reporting period in accordance with this Order.
Scope(17)
(5) When conducting the verification of an Emissions Report, the scope of the verification must reflect the period of time and information covered by the report and the CORSIA eligible fuels claims, where applicable.
(6) This must include—
(a)
CO2 emissions from aeroplane fuel monitoring methods, calculated in accordance with articles 22, 23, 26(1) to (4), 28 and 29, and
(b)
emissions reductions from the use of CORSIA eligible fuels.
(7) The scope of the verification of the CORSIA eligible fuel claims in the Emissions Report must include the following—
(a)
any internal aeroplane operator procedures for CORSIA eligible fuels, including aeroplane operator controls to ensure the claimed CORSIA eligible fuels satisfy the CORSIA Sustainability Criteria,
(b)
checks for double claiming are limited to the specific aeroplane operator. Any findings outside this scope are not relevant for the verification statement, but they must still be included in the Verification Report for further consideration by the Regulator,
(c)
assessment of verification risk with appropriate changes to the verification plan, and
(d)
assessment of whether there is sufficient access to relevant internal and external information to obtain sufficient confidence in each CORSIA eligible fuel claim. Where evidence of the sustainability or the size of the CORSIA eligible fuel claim is considered either inappropriate or insufficient, further information must be sought directly from the fuel producer with direct access facilitated through the aeroplane operator.
Materiality(18)
(8) When conducting the verification of an Emissions Report, the verification body must apply the following materiality thresholds—
(a)
of 2 per cent for aeroplane operators with annual emissions on international flights above 500,000 tonnes, and
(b)
of 5 per cent for aeroplane operators with annual emissions on international flights equal to or less than 500,000 tonnes of CO2.
(9) When conducting the verification of an Emissions Report, the over and understatements in sub-paragraph (8) must be allowed to balance out in both cases.
General(19)
(10) Prior to the development of the verification approach, the verification body must assess the risk of misstatements and non-conformities and their likelihood of a material effect on the basis of a strategic analysis of the aeroplane operator’s greenhouse gas emissions information(20).
(11) Depending on the information obtained during the verification, the verification body must revise the risk assessment and modify or repeat the verification activities to be performed.
Validation of verification plan(21)
(12) The verification team must prepare the verification plan on the basis of the strategic analysis and assessment of risks. The verification plan must include a description of the verification activities for each variable that has a potential impact on the reported emissions. The verification team must consider the assessment of risk, and the requirement to deliver a verification opinion with reasonable assurance, when determining sample size.
(13) The verification plan must also include the following—
(a)
verification team members, roles, responsibilities and qualifications,
(b)
any external resources required,
(c)

Assessment of GHG data and information(23)
(15) The verification team must confirm that the Emissions Report data has been collected in accordance with the approved Emissions Monitoring Plan and monitoring requirements specified in this Order.
(16) In accordance with the Emissions Report sampling plan, the verification body must carry out substantive data testing consisting of analytical procedures and data verification to assess the plausibility and completeness of data.
(17) The verification team must, as a minimum, assess the plausibility of fluctuations and trends over time or between comparable data items as well as identify and assess immediate outliers, unexpected data, anomalies, and data gaps.
(18) Depending on the outcome of Emissions Report data testing and assessment, the assessment of risk, verification and sampling plan must be amended, where necessary.
Evaluation of the GHG assertion(24)
(19) The verification body must use an independent reviewer not involved in the verification activities to assess the internal verification documentation, and the Verification Report, prior to its submission to the aeroplane operator and Regulator.
(20) The independent review, whose scope must include the complete verification process, must be recorded in the internal verification documentation.
(21) The independent review must be performed to ensure that the verification process has been conducted in accordance with ISO 14065:2013, ISO 14064-3:2006 and this Order, and that the evidence gathered is appropriate and sufficient to enable the verification body to issue a Verification Report with reasonable assurance.
Validation and verification statement(25)
(22) The verification body must submit a copy of the Verification Report to the aeroplane operator. Upon authorisation by the aeroplane operator, the verification body must forward a copy of the Verification Report together with the Emissions Report to the Regulator. The Verification Report must include—

2011 c. 25.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the monitoring, reporting and verification requirements of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Civil Aviation (CORSIA) in Volume IV of Annex 16 to the Convention on Civil Aviation adopted by the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on 27 June 2018.
This Order extends to the whole of the United Kingdom.
Under CORSIA a baseline level of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is established for aeroplane operators undertaking international flights. Aeroplane operators must monitor and report emissions for each year.
Part 1 sets out the general provisions for the Order, including the scope of application and flights to which the Order does not apply, and the definitions of various expressions used in the Order, and specifically the definition for the “aeroplane operator”.
Part 2, in conjunction with Schedules 1 and 5, sets out the administrative provisions for the Order. Chapter 1 sets out the requirements to notify ICAO of the United Kingdom’s voluntary participation in CORSIA, to establish the attribution of aeroplane operators to the United Kingdom and international flights to those aeroplane operators, defines the regulator and the regulator’s tasks, sets out the record keeping requirements, compliance deadlines, and regulates the use of equivalent procedures, and the role of the Civil Aviation Authority. Chapter 2 makes provision in respect of an aeroplane operator’s change in circumstances. Chapter 3 sets out the requirements for the submission of applications and notices under the Order to a regulator, the determination of applications by a regulator, and the service of notices given by a regulator.
Part 3, in conjunction with Schedules 1 to 6, establishes the monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) requirements of an aeroplane operator’s annual CO2 emissions from attributable flights. Chapter 1 sets out the applicability of the MRV requirements. Chapter 2 establishes the requirements for the monitoring of aeroplane operator annual CO2 emissions. These provisions include the duty on an aeroplane operator to monitor its CO2 emissions, the monitoring methods available, the requirement for an Emissions Monitoring Plan, the calculation of CO2 emissions from aeroplane fuel use, and the monitoring of CORSIA eligible fuels. Chapter 3 establishes the requirements for the reporting of aeroplane operator annual CO2 emissions. These provisions include the requirements on the aeroplane operator to report CO2 emissions and CORSIA eligible fuel use, and on the Secretary of State to report those emissions for aeroplane operators administered in the United Kingdom to ICAO. Chapter 4, in conjunction with Schedule 6, sets out the standards and requirements for the verification and accreditation bodies and establishes the requirements for the verification of aeroplane operator annual CO2 emissions and CORSIA eligible fuel use. Chapter 5 sets out the requirement for data management and control. These provisions include the requirements for the management of data gaps, corrective actions, improvements to the monitoring methodology, the rounding of data, and the use of an electronic data exchange and automated systems.
Part 4 makes provision for a regulator to charge for services undertaken pursuant to the Order, subject to the approval of the charge scheme by the relevant minister, its publication, and any revision of the charges.
Part 5 makes provision for compliance monitoring by a regulator or an authorised person. These provisions include the enabling of inspections, the issuing of warrants, and the issuing of information notices by a regulator.
Part 6 sets out the enforcement requirements of the Order. The provisions include the requirements and issue of enforcement and penalty notices by a regulator, and establish the civil penalties which are applied to the specified acts or omissions of an aeroplane operator or other person in relation to the requirements of the Order. Those acts or omissions include failing to apply, or make revised application, for an emissions monitoring plan, failing to monitor emissions, failing to report emissions, failing to keep records, failing to comply with enforcement notice given by a regulator, failing to comply with an information notice, providing false or misleading information, etc. and refusing to allow access to premises for an inspection by a regulator or authorised person.
Part 7, in conjunction with Schedules 7 and 8, establishes appeals bodies, the right of appeal against certain decisions of a regulator, the effect of an appeal on the matter being appealed, and the appeals procedures.
Part 8 gives effect to the Schedules and makes provision for consequential amendments and savings in relation to the retained EU law which introduced the initial monitoring and reporting requirements for CORSIA through the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument, as no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside this Order on the UK legislation website, www.legislation.gov.uk.

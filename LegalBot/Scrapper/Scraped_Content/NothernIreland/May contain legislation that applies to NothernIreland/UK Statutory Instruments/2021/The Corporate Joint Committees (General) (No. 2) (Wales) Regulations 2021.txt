Part 2 provides that corporate joint committees in Wales must appoint executive officers, namely a Chief Executive Officer, a Chief Finance Officer and a Monitoring Officer. This Part also provides further detail on the functions to be exercised by each of these office holders.
Part 3 includes general provisions in relation to corporate joint committee staff. For example, this Part amends the definition of a “proper officer” in the Local Government Act 1972. It also applies provisions in Part 1 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to corporate joint committees. These provide that certain posts in a corporate joint committee are politically restricted as they are in a local authority and that holders of such posts in any relevant authority may not be co-opted as members of a corporate joint committee.
Part 4 makes provision permitting corporate joint committees to make arrangements for their functions to be discharged by sub-committees, staff or in conjunction with other corporate joint committees or county or county borough councils in Wales. A sub-committee appointed by a corporate joint committee may have members who are not also members of the corporate joint committee.
Part 5 provides detail on the manner in which meetings and proceedings of corporate joint committees (and any sub-committee of a corporate joint committee) are to be undertaken. For example notice and documentation requirements and provision about the location of (and remote access to) meetings.
Part 6 sets out miscellaneous and consequential amendments that it is necessary to make to both some primary and secondary legislation as a result of the establishment of corporate joint committees and the other provisions in these Regulations.
These Regulations are connected with the regulations which established certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 and which came into force on 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2021. A regulatory impact assessment was prepared at the time of making those establishment regulations and a copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

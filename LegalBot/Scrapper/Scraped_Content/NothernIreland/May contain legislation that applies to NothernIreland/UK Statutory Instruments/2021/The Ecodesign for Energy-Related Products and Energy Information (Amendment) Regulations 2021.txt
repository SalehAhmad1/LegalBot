27th September 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of ecodesign and energy labelling for energy-related products.
Parts 2 and 3 correct minor technical issues in retained EU tertiary legislation. Part 2 amends Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/424 of 15 March 2019 laying down ecodesign requirements for servers and data storage products pursuant to Directive 2009/125/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 617/2013 (EUR 2019/424). Part 3 amends Commission Delegated Regulations relating to the energy labelling of electronic displays, household washing machines and household washer-dryers, refrigerating appliances, and household dishwashers (EUR 2019/2013, EUR 2019/2014, EUR 2019/2016 and EUR 2019/2017 respectively).
The amendments in Part 2 and 3 are closely aligned with the amendments made by the European Union to the underlying EU legislation. The amending EU measures are Commission Regulation (EU) 2021/341 of 23 February 2021 amending Regulations (EU) 2019/424, (EU) 2019/1781, (EU) 2019/2019, (EU) 2019/2020, (EU) 2019/2021, (EU) 2019/2022, (EU) 2019/2023 and (EU) 2019/2024 with regard to ecodesign requirements for servers and data storage products, electric motors and variable speed drives, refrigerating appliances, light sources and separate control gears, electronic displays, household dishwashers, household washing machines and household washer-dryers and refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function (OJ L 68, 26.2.2021, p. 108-148) and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/340 of 17 December 2020 amending Delegated Regulations (EU) 2019/2013, (EU) 2019/2014, (EU) 2019/2015, (EU) 2019/2016, (EU) 2019/2017 and (EU) 2019/2018 with regard to energy labelling requirements for electronic displays, household washing machines and household washer-dryers, light sources, refrigerating appliances, household dishwashers, and refrigerating appliances with a direct sales function (OJ L 68, 26.2.2021, p. 62-107).
Parts 4 and 5 update the tables in Schedule 1 to the Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2617) and Schedule 1 to the Energy Information Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1524) to ensure that the market surveillance authorities in England and Wales and Scotland can enforce the relevant measures for energy-related products.

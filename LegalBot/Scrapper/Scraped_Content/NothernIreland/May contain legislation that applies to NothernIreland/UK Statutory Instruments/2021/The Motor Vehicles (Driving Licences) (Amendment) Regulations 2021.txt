(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations relate to the conduct of theory, manoeuvres, practical and unitary tests for driving licenses in Great Britain. They expand the existing provision, in Part III of the Motor Vehicles (Driving Licences) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999/2864), which enables the police, and the fire and rescue services, to appoint examiners to conduct such tests for the purposes of testing employees of those services.
These Regulations enable the following—
(a)
ambulance service NHS trusts and ambulance service NHS foundation trusts, in England and Wales, to appoint invigilators to conduct theory tests and examiners to conduct manoeuvres, practical and unitary tests for their, and each other’s, employees;
(b)
the Scottish Ambulance Service Board to appoint invigilators to conduct theory tests and examiners to conduct manoeuvres, practical and unitary tests for their employees;
(c)
invigilators of theory tests and examiners of manoeuvres, practical and unitary tests, duly appointed by any of the emergency services (police, fire and rescue, and ambulance), to conduct such tests anywhere in Great Britain, for employees of each other’s services and, or, defence personnel; and
(d)
invigilators of theory tests and examiners of manoeuvres, practical and unitary tests, duly appointed by the Secretary of State for Defence, to conduct such tests, anywhere in Great Britain, for employees of one or more emergency services.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside these Regulations on the UK legislation website www.legislation.gov.uk.

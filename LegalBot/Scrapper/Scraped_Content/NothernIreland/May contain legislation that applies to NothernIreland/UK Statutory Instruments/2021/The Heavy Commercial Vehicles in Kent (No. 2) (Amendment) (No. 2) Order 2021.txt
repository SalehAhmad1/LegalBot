(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 2) Order 2019 (“the 2019 Order”). The 2019 Order is one of a series of Orders which enable the movement of cross-Channel lorries in Kent to be controlled by, amongst other things, regulating access to the road network.
The 2019 Order was amended by the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 2) Amendment Order 2021 (“the First 2021 Order”). In addition to other amendments, the First 2021 Order sought to amend the definition of “the relevant class of road” in the 2019 Order to remove roads leading to Manston Airfield and to include roads providing access to the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone and the Port of Dover and to the Sevington and Ebbsfleet Inland Border Facilities. However, the amendment to the definition of “the relevant class of road” was not made correctly. This Order therefore corrects that error by deleting the relevant wording from the 2019 Order and inserting the correct definition of “the relevant class of road”.

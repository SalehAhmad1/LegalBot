(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(d)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulations 2, 3 and 5 amend the Trade in Animals and Related Products Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1197), the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Scotland) Regulations 2012 and Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (EUR 2017/625) respectively, to change the date from which transitional prior notification requirements for products of animal origin and prescribed types of plant and plant products apply from 1st April 2021 to 31st July 2021.
Regulation 4 amends the Plant Health (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1482), to extend the duration of transitional provision relating to imports of plants, plant products and other objects into Great Britain from EU Member States (exemptions from requirements for imports to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate). The date on which that transitional provision expires is amended from 31st March 2021 to 31st December 2021.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes amendments to the Russia (Sanctions) (Overseas Territories) Order 2020 (S.I. 2020/1571) (“the 2020 Order”).
The 2020 Order extends with modifications the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the Regulations”) as amended from time to time to all British overseas territories except Bermuda and Gibraltar (which implement sanctions under their own legislative arrangements).
Article 2 of this Order amends the 2020 Order in order to correct an omission in the modifications made to the Regulations. The amendment replaces the modification to regulation 80 (penalties for offences) as the original modification omitted to supply a penalty for the offence of failing to comply with a Crimean ports direction under Part 6 (Ships).
An Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this Order: the territorial extent of both this Order, and the 2020 Order which it amends, is the British overseas territories listed in the Schedule, and no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sector in the United Kingdom.

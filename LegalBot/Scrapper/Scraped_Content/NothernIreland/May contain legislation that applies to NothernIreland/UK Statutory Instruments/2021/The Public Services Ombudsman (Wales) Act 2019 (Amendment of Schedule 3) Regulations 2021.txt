17 March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Schedule 3 to the Public Services Ombudsman (Wales) Act 2019 (anaw 3). Schedule 3 sets out the bodies and other persons who are listed authorities for the purposes of that Act and are therefore within the remit of the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales (“the Ombudsman”).
These Regulations add to Schedule 3 corporate joint committees which are established by Regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (asc 1).
Section 33 of the Public Services Ombudsman (Wales) Act 2019 requires that Regulations under section 31(2) which add a person to Schedule 3 must specify whether all or only some of that person’s functions are to fall within the remit of the Ombudsman under Part 3 of that Act (investigations). Regulation 2(2) of these Regulations specifies that all of the functions of a corporate joint committee are to fall within the remit of the Ombudsman under Part 3 of that Act.
These Regulations are connected with Regulations which establish certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021. The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the Regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

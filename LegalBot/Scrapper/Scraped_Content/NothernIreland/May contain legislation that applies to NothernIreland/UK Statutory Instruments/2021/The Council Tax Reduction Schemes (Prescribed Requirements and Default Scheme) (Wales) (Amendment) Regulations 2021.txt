13 January 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Council Tax Reduction Schemes and Prescribed Requirements (Wales) Regulations 2013 (“the Prescribed Requirements Regulations”) and the Council Tax Reduction Schemes (Default Scheme) (Wales) Regulations 2013 (“the Default Scheme Regulations”) made under section 13A(4) and (5) of, and Schedule 1B to, the Local Government Finance Act 1992.
The Prescribed Requirements Regulations require each billing authority in Wales to make a scheme specifying the reductions which are to apply to amounts of council tax payable by persons, or classes of persons, whom the authority considers are in financial need. The Prescribed Requirements Regulations also set out the matters that must be included within such a scheme.
The Default Scheme Regulations set out a scheme that will take effect, in respect of dwellings situated in the area of a billing authority, if the authority fails to make its own scheme.
These Regulations amend both the Prescribed Requirements and the Default Scheme Regulations.
The amendments made to the Prescribed Requirements Regulations by regulations 3, 6, 9 and 10 provide for how payments under “the Windrush Compensation Scheme” are to be taken into account when determining eligibility for a reduction and the amount of a reduction. The same amendments are made to the Default Scheme Regulations by regulations 12, 15, 18 and 19.
The amendment made to the Prescribed Requirements Regulations by regulation 4(2) provides for how payments of universal credit to claimants who have reached state pension credit qualifying age are to be taken into account when determining eligibility for a reduction and the amount of a reduction. The same amendment is made to the Default Scheme Regulations by regulation 14.
The amendments to the Prescribed Requirements Regulations by regulations 4(1), 5, 7 and 8 increase certain figures that are used in calculating whether a person is entitled to a reduction and the amount of that reduction. The uprated figures relate to non-dependant deductions (adjustments made to the maximum amount of reduction a person can receive to take account of adults living in the dwelling who are not dependants of the applicant); and the applicable amount in relation to an application for a reduction (the amount against which an applicant’s income is compared in order to determine the amount of reduction to which the applicant is entitled). The same amendments are made to the Default Scheme Regulations by regulations 13, 16 and 17.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

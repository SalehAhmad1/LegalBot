(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations apply in relation to England only and are made in exercise of the powers conferred by paragraph 11A(1) of Schedule 2 to the Trade in Animals and Related Products Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1197).
Regulation 2 amends the date in regulation 3(1) of the Meat Preparations (Amendment and Transitory Modification) (England) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1666) in order to extend the effect of those Regulations, which, in relation to imports originating from or produced in, establishments situated in EEA member States, the Faroe Islands, Greenland or Switzerland, temporarily suspend the requirement for meat preparations imported into England to be deep frozen. That requirement is imposed by Article 3(3) of Commission Decision 2000/572/EC laying down the animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions for imports of meat preparations into the Community from third countries (EUDN 2000/572). The extension of the suspension is until midnight on 31st December 2021. The date had previously been amended by the Meat Preparations (Amendment and Transitory Modification) (England) (EU Exit) (Amendment) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/366).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact, or no significant impact, on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

16th December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/582) (“the International Travel Regulations”).
Regulation 3 amends regulation 3J of the International Travel Regulations so that eligible travellers in transit are not required to take a day 2 test under that provision.
Regulation 4 amends regulation 3K of the International Travel Regulations—
(a)
to make clear that those persons to whom the work place testing regime in regulation 7 or 8 of the International Travel Regulations applies are not required to comply with that regulation;
(b)
to ensure that the other exemptions from the requirement to self-isolate under that regulation are consistent with those in regulation 9(15);
(c)
so that eligible travellers who are not required by reason of their age, or are not able by reason of a disability, to take a day 2 test can stop self-isolating when a member of the party which they travelled with receives the result of their day 2 test;
(d)
to enable a child who is under the age of 5 and travels unaccompanied to take an optional day 2 test following their arrival in England. If the result of that test is negative, they may cease to self-isolate.
Amendments are made to the definition of “required notification” for the purposes of regulations 3ZA and 17 of the International Travel Regulations so that a notification issued by an approved third country or territory may be accepted if it states the name of the country or territory in which the relevant test was carried out (regulations 5 and 8).
Regulation 6 amends regulation 19 of the International Travel Regulations to create an offence of knowingly giving false information pursuant to regulation 2A of the Self-Isolation Regulations, as it applies by virtue of paragraph 3(2A) of Schedule 8. Consequential amendments are made to Schedule 14 to the Regulations (amount of fixed penalties) (regulation 9).
Regulation 7 adds additional sporting events to the list in Schedule 5 to the International Travel Regulations.
These Regulations also make other minor and consequential amendments to the International Travel Regulations.
These Regulations also make minor amendments to the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010, to remove obsolete cross references.

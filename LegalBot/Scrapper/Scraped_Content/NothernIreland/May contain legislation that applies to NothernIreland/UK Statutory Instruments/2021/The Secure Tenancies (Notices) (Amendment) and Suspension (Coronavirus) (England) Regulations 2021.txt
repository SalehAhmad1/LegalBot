(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 83 of the Housing Act 1985 (c. 68) sets out general notice requirements in relation to proceedings for possession or termination of a secure tenancy. Section 83(2)(a) gives the Secretary of State power to prescribe the form of a notice under section 83.
Paragraph 10(2) of Schedule 29 to the Coronavirus Act 2020 (c. 7) modifies the notice of seeking termination of tenancy and recovery of possession under section 83 during the relevant period which began on 26th March 2020 and ends on 30th September 2021.
These Regulations suspend paragraph 10(2) of Schedule 29 and prescribe a new form of notice of seeking termination of tenancy and recovery of possession by amending the Schedule to the Secure Tenancies (Notices) Regulations 1987. They are made to reflect the modifications of the required period of notice for secure tenancies made by paragraph 3 of Schedule 29 to the Coronavirus Act 2020 (as amended).

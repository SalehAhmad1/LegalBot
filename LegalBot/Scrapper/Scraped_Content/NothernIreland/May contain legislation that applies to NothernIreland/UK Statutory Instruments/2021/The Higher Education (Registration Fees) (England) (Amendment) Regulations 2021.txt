(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Higher Education (Registration Fees) (England) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/543) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 reduces by approximately 3% the annual ongoing fees set out in the 2019 Regulations which the Office for Students, the higher education regulator in England, may charge institutions for their registration in the register of English higher education providers which is maintained by the Office for Students under section 3 of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (c. 29). By virtue of regulation 1(2), the reduction in fees applies to the amount of the ongoing fees payable by institutions on or after 1st August 2021.
A full impact assessment of the effect that the 2019 Regulations would have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector was produced. No further impact assessment has been carried out in relation to this instrument.

12th April 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations further amend the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles Regulations 1986 (S.I. 1986/183) by an amendment to regulation 5C.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 5C(1)(b) to substitute a reference to regulation 9A of the Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions (England) General Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/3483) (“the 2007 Regulations”) for a reference to regulation 9. This corrects an out of date cross-reference to the 2007 Regulations so that it refers to regulation 9A which provides for the service of a penalty charge notice where a vehicle is stationary on a road in a civil enforcement area.

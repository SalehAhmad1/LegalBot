(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Section 57 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 requires local authorities to ensure that the need for accommodation-based support to victims of domestic abuse in their area is assessed. Accommodation-based support is defined in that section as support, in relation to domestic abuse, provided to victims of domestic abuse, or their children, who reside in relevant accommodation. Regulation 2 of these Regulations specify what types of accommodation are relevant accommodation.
Regulation 3 amends regulation A13 of the Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 to include an exception from under-occupancy deductions for any housing benefit claimant who is living in a social sector rented property that is adapted under a sanctuary scheme as a result of a member of that household having had domestic violence threatened or inflicted upon them. It also inserts definitions for terms used in the amendment.
Regulation 4 amends paragraph 36 of Schedule 4 to the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 to include an equivalent exception from under-occupancy deductions for Universal Credit claimants living in social rented sector properties adapted under a sanctuary scheme.
Regulation 5 provides that the regulation relating to universal credit has effect on 1st October 2021 if a claimant’s assessment period begins on that day and, if it does not, on the first date of a claimant’s next assessment period following 1st October 2021.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact is foreseen on the private or voluntary sectors.

Suitable programme of study

the suitability of the programme of study to meet the young person’s desired outcomes;

2.  Where the young person is already undertaking the programme of study, the local authority may not conclude that there is no longer a realistic prospect that continuing to undertake the programme of study as intended at the outset would enable the young person to meet the person’s desired outcomes unless it has taken into account the following factors—
(a)
that young people progress at different rates and a young person’s progress towards meeting the desired outcomes may not be apparent until later in the programme of study;
(b)
the young person’s expectation of having the opportunity to complete the programme of study as intended at the outset;
(c)
whether the young person’s capability to learn has been affected by a significant change in the young person’s personal circumstances or needs.

(2) The factors, where relevant, that the local authority must take into account are—
(a)
where the programme is designed to allow the young person to access a course of further education or training which is undertaken by young people who do not have additional learning needs—
(i)
the usual length of the course for young people who do not have additional learning needs, and
(ii)
whether the young person requires additional time in comparison to the majority of other young people who do not have additional learning needs, to complete the course;
(b)
where the programme of study is specially designed to provide additional learning provision for the young person, whether there are any exceptional reasons relating to the young person’s capability to learn such that the person’s desired outcomes cannot realistically be met within the period of 2 years.

Extension to a programme of study
4.—(1) The young person has been unable to complete a programme of study (including where it is an additional programme of study under paragraph 5(1)) within the programme’s duration as intended at the outset and it is proposed to extend the programme to enable the young person to meet the person’s desired outcomes at the start of the programme (“original outcomes”) or ones that are substantially similar to the original outcomes (“adjusted outcomes”).
(2) The factors, where relevant, that the local authority must take into account are—
(a)
whether the circumstances giving rise to the proposed extension are unavoidable;
(b)
whether the proposed extension is necessary to enable the young person to complete the programme of study and meet the original or adjusted outcomes;
(c)
whether the proposed extension is for a purpose that should have been addressed during the original duration of the programme of study and where that is the case, the reasons why it was not addressed;
(d)
whether the proposed extension is proportionate to the original outcomes which are not yet met or the adjusted outcomes and whether an alternative length of extension is required in the circumstances;
(e)
where the programme of study has previously been extended—
(i)
whether the proposed extension arises from the same facts as the previous one, and
(ii)
whether there are exceptional reasons why the young person was unable to achieve the outcomes during the previous extension.

Additional programme of study
5.—(1) The programme of study that it is proposed the young person undertake is additional to further education or training which the young person has already undertaken.
(2) The factors, where relevant, that the local authority must take into account are—
(a)
that the young person is unable to benefit in a meaningful way from the previous further education or training due to—
(i)
the previous further education or training falling so far below the expected standard that the provider of it cannot reasonably be said to have delivered the education or training necessary to meet the young person’s desired outcomes in undertaking it,
(ii)
a significant change in the personal circumstances or needs of the young person, or
(iii)
any other exceptional circumstances;
(b)
where the previous further education or training was undertaken by the young person at a maintained school or institution in the further education sector, that an essential and substantial element of the further education or training necessary to meet the young person’s desired outcomes could not have been delivered as part of that previous further education or training;
(c)
where the duration of the previous education or training was less than 2 years, the total duration of that previous education or training and that of the proposed programme of study and whether the extent to which that total duration exceeds 2 years is reasonable in all the circumstances;
(d)
whether there are any other exceptional circumstances to suggest that the young person has not received effective access to further education or training.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018 (“the 2018 Act”) establishes the system in Wales for meeting the additional learning needs of children and young people. These Regulations supplement the system provided for in the 2018 Act.
Part 1 of these Regulations includes provision on the interpretation of terms used throughout the Regulations. There are also specific interpretation provisions in other regulations, where the words and expressions used are used only for the purposes of regulations dealing with a particular matter (for example, regulation 34 in Part 4). Regulation 3 makes provision about notifying someone or giving someone a document under these Regulations.
Part 2 of these Regulations deals with a range of matters related to individual development plans and supplements the provisions of Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the 2018 Act. In particular, regulations 6 to 10 make provision about local authority decisions under sections 14 and 31 of the 2018 Act about the necessity of maintaining individual development plans for young people who are not at a maintained school in Wales or an institution in the further education sector in Wales. There are also provisions related to a transfer of responsibility for an individual development plan from one body to another. Regulations 20 to 25 apply, with modifications, duties in the 2018 Act in relation to children and young people who are detained in hospital under Part 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983.
Part 3 of these Regulations makes provision about supplementary functions in Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the 2018 Act and functions in sections 68 and 69 of that Act. It includes provisions relating to additional learning needs co-ordinators. Section 60 of the 2018 Act requires governing bodies of maintained schools (except special schools) and further education institutions in Wales to designate a person (or persons) as the additional learning needs co-ordinator to be responsible for co-ordinating additional learning provision for pupils or students with additional learning needs. Regulations 27 and 28 set out the qualifications or experience that additional learning needs co-ordinators must have and regulations 29 and 30 confer functions on additional learning needs co-ordinators relating to the additional learning provision for pupils or students with additional learning needs. These Regulations do not affect the governing body’s ability to confer further responsibilities upon the additional learning needs co-ordinator. These provisions replace provisions of the Additional Learning Needs Co-ordinator (Wales) Regulations 2020, which are revoked by regulation 1.
Part 4 of these Regulations makes provision about parents and young people lacking capacity. It deals with young people, and parents of children, who lack mental capacity to take the decisions or actions required. For the purposes of the 2018 Act, a person lacks capacity when they lack capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, that is, when they lack mental, not legal capacity. The Regulations provide that where a child’s parent lacks capacity all references to the child’s parent are to be read as references to a representative of the parent. The Regulations also provide that where a young person lacks capacity, the references to the young person are to be read as references to the young person’s representative, or to the young person’s parent.
Part 4 makes it clear that the provisions concerning mental capacity have effect in spite of section 27(1)(g) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Welsh Government at Cathays Park, Cardiff CF10 3NQ and on the Welsh Government website at www.gov.wales.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations appoint 5th July 2021 as the day for section 131 of the Finance Act 2021 (“FA 2021”) to come into force.
Section 131(1) of FA 2021 amends Part 1 of the Finance Act 1994 by inserting new sections 16A, 16B and 16C into Chapter 2. These sections introduce a new power for HMRC to grant temporary approval to a business seeking review of or appealing a decision to remove, or reject, a trading approval, in order that its right to review or appeal is safeguarded.
Section 131(2) of FA 2021 provides that the new temporary approval process applies to decisions made prior to this legislation coming into force.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared for this instrument as it gives effect to previously announced policy and it is an appointed day order.

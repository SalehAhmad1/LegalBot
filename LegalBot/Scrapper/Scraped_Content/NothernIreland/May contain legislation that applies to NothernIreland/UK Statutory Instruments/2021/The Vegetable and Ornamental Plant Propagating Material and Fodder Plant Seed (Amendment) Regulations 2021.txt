These Regulations make amendments to legislation concerning vegetable and ornamental plants and plant propagating material and fodder seed to remove provisions relating to Northern Ireland which are no longer necessary in consequence of EU legislation added to paragraph 42 of Annex 2 to the Protocol.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

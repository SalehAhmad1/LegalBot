26th May 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16), in order to address failures to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(b), (ea) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends retained direct EU legislation, namely Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the establishment of a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register. The amendments ensure that certain provisions of that Regulation are re-stated to ensure that they are clearer and more accessible. This is necessary because Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 was amended at an EU level after amendments made by the Environment and Wildlife (Legislative Functions) (EU Exit) Regulation 2019 (S.I. 2019/473) were made. The amendments provide for functions of a legislative character previously exercised by EU entities under that Regulation instead to be exercisable by a public authority in the United Kingdom.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

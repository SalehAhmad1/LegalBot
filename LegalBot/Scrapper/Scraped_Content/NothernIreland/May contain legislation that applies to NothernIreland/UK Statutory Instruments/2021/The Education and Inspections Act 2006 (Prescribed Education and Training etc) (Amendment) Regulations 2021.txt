(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education and Inspections Act 2006 (Prescribed Education and Training etc) Regulations 2007.
Regulation 3 is amended to reflect that the education and training prescribed in regulation 3 under section 123(1)(h) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, is funded by the Secretary of State, rather than the Office for Students or the Learning and Skills Council (“LSC”). The LSC no longer exists.
Regulation 7 is amended to provide that copies of statements prepared under section 127(2) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 must be sent to the Secretary of State, rather than the LSC.
In addition, regulations 7 and 9 are amended to remove references to the Quality Improvement Agency which no longer exists.
Regulations 8 and 9 are amended to reflect that section 130(2) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 has been repealed.
Regulation 9 is amended to provide that copies of statements prepared under section 130(3) of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 must be sent to the Secretary of State, rather than the Quality Improvement Agency.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

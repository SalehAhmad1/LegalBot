(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Heavy Commercial Vehicles in Kent (No. 3) Order 2019 to regulate further the movement of cross-Channel lorries in Kent. The Order allows priority access to certain parts of the road network to be given to empty lorries leaving the UK to enable them to restock and return with fresh supplies, and to lorries supplying groceries to Gibraltar.
The Order also allows a requirement to be imposed on lorry drivers and people travelling with them to have had a negative Covid-19 result, and to produce evidence of this on request, as a condition of access to the coastbound carriageways of the motorway network in Kent. The test must be of a type specified in the Order and must be taken less than 72 hours before the expected time of departure from the Port of Dover or the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone.
A full Impact Assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it is not expected to have a significant impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors.

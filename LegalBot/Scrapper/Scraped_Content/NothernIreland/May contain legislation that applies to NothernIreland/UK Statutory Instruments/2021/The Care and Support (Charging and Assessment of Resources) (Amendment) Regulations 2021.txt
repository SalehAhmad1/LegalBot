(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Care and Support (Charging and Assessment of Resources) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2672) (“the 2014 Regulations”) to include two additional categories of capital to be disregarded in the calculation of an adult’s capital for the purpose of an assessment of that adult’s financial resources under the 2014 Regulations.
Regulation 2 inserts two types of payments into Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations. The first is payments paid under the Victims’ Payments Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/103). It provides that any payment which would have been disregarded under regulation 26 of those Regulations must be disregarded for the purposes of the 2014 Regulations.
The second type of payment is compensation paid under Part 1 of the Historical Abuse (Northern Ireland) Act 2019 (c. 31), and similarly provides that payments made under that Act must be disregarded for the purposes of the 2014 Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

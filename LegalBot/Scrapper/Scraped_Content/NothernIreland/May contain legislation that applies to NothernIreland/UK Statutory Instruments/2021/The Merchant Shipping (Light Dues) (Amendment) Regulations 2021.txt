6th March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Merchant Shipping (Light Dues) Regulations 1997 by increasing the rate per ton at which light dues are payable from 37 and a half pence per ton to 38 and a half pence per ton and by making a corresponding upward adjustment (from £15,000 to £15,400) to the maximum amount for any one voyage by a ship where that voyage ends at a port or place in the United Kingdom on or after 1st April 2021.
An Explanatory Memorandum for this instrument is published alongside these Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk. A full regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared for these amendments because they vary the charges with respect to light dues and such charges are not included as a “regulatory provision” for the purposes of section 22(4)(a)(i) of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (c. 26).

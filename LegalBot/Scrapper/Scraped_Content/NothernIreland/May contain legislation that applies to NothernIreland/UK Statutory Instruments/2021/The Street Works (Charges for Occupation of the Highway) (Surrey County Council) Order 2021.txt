(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order provides approval for Surrey County Council to enable it to require the payment of charges in accordance with the Surrey Lane Rental Scheme (“the Scheme”) for certain street works carried out in the highway.
The requirement to pay charges to an Approved Authority is set out in the Street Works (Charges for Occupation of the Highway) (England) Regulations 2012 (“the 2012 Regulations”).
The Scheme, which has been submitted to and approved by the Secretary of State, is designed to control the carrying out of works in specified traffic sensitive locations at traffic sensitive times. This will be achieved by requiring the payment of a charge, in accordance with the 2012 Regulations, for each day that the street is occupied by the works. Surrey County Council may reduce or waive the daily charge and the Scheme contains guidance as to when a discount will be applied.
A copy of the Scheme can be inspected at the offices of Surrey County Council, Hazel House, Merrow Depot, Merrow Lane, Guildford, Surrey, GU4 7BQ. It is also available on the Surrey County Council website at https://www.surreycc.gov.uk/roads-and-transport.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2(1) of these Regulations modifies the Statutory Sick Pay (Medical Evidence) Regulations 1985 to provide that an employee shall not be required to provide medical information in respect of the first 28 days of any spell of incapacity for work. Regulation 2(2) limits the application of this modification to spells of incapacity for work which either start during the period 17th December to 26th January or which commence prior to the Regulations coming into force but which have not lasted more than 7 days on that date (and hence the requirement to provide medical evidence has not yet arisen).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as it makes provision which is to have effect for a period of less than 12 months.

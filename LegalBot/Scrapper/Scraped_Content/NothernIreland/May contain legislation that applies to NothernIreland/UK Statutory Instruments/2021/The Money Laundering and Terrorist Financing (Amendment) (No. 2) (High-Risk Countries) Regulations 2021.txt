(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (S.I. 2017/692) (“the MLRs”) by substituting the list of high-risk third countries in Schedule 3ZA for a new list. Schedule 3ZA had originally been inserted into the MLRs by the Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Amendment) (High-Risk Countries) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/392).
On the new list, Ghana is no longer classed as a high-risk country for the purposes of enhanced customer due diligence requirements in regulation 33(3).
Haiti, Malta, Philippines and South Sudan are now classed as high-risk countries for the purposes of enhanced customer due diligence requirements in regulation 33(3).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

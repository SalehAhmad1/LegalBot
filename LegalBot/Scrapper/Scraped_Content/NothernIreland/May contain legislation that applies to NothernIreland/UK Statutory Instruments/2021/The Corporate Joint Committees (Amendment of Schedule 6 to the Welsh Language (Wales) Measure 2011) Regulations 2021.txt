17 March 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011 (nawm 1) (“the Measure”) makes provision for the specification of standards of conduct in relation to the Welsh Language.
Section 25 of the Measure requires a person to comply with a standard of conduct in relation to the Welsh Language which is specified by the Welsh Ministers if, in addition to other conditions being met, the person is liable to be required to comply with Welsh Language standards and the standard is potentially applicable to the person.
These Regulations amend Schedule 6 to the Measure to add corporate joint committees established by Regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 (asc 1). The effect of this is that corporate joint committees are bodies which are liable to comply with Welsh Language standards and that service delivery standards, policy making standards, operational standards, promotion standards and record keeping standards are potentially applicable to them.
These Regulations are connected with Regulations which establish certain corporate joint committees under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021. The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the Regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Strategic Finance Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

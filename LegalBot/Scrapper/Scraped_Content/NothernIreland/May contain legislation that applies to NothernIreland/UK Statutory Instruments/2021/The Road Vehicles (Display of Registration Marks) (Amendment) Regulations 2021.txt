(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument amends the Road Vehicles (Display of Registration Marks) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/561) (“the 2001 Regulations”). The amendment is made in response to the JCSI’s thirty-seventh report of Session 2019-2021 suggesting that regulation 10(2) of the 2001 Regulations should explicitly be made subject to paragraph (4A).
The 2001 Regulations were amended by The Road Vehicles (Display of Registration Marks) (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1363) (“the 2020 Regulations”). The 2020 Regulations amended regulation 10(2) to provide that the requirement for the registration plates of vehicles first registered on or after September 2001 to conform to the requirements set out in Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the 2001 Regulations, will only apply to vehicles first registered on or after September 2001, but before 1st September 2021.
The 2020 Regulations also inserted a new paragraph (4A) into regulation 10 to provide that where on or after 1st September 2021 a new registration plate is fixed to a vehicle to which either regulation 10(2) or regulation 10(3) applies to replace a plate previously fixed thereto, the plate must conform to the requirements set out in Part A1 of Schedule 2.
These Regulations make regulation 10(2) explicitly subject to paragraph (4A). This is to provide further clarity that a new or replacement registration plate that on or after 1st September 2021 is fixed to a vehicle which was first registered on or after 1st September 2001, but before 1st September 2021 must comply with the requirements set out in Part A1 of Schedule 2.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

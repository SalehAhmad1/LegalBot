(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend section 1 of the Equality Act 2010 (“the Act”) to add authorities to the list of authorities that are subject to a public sector duty regarding socio-economic inequalities under section 1(1) of that Act.
The list of Welsh authorities specified in section 1(3A) of the Act are authorities which satisfy the test in section 2(6) of the Act, that is, they are ‘devolved Welsh Authorities’ (within the meaning given by section 157A of the Government of Wales Act 2006), whose functions correspond or are similar to those of an authority for the time being specified in subsection (3) of section 1 or referred to in subsection (4) of that section.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained at Education and Public Services Group, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

15 July 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in consequence of the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Act 2018. That Act reforms the law on education and training for children and young people with additional learning needs and renames the Special Educational Needs Tribunal for Wales as the Education Tribunal for Wales.
These Regulations update references in primary legislation to reflect these changes.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

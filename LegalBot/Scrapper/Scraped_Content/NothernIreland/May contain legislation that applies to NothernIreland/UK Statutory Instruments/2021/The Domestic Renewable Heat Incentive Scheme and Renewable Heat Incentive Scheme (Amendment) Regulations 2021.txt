evidence of any heat loss calculation used in determining the increase in the amount of heat in kWhth generated by the accredited RHI installation for eligible purposes.
(11) On receipt of a notification under paragraph (8), the Authority may request the participant to provide, within a period of no less than four weeks starting with the date of the request, additional information in order to be satisfied as to the matters specified in paragraph (12)(a) to (c).
(12) Paragraphs (13) and (14) apply if the Authority is satisfied that, following a modification—
(a)
the accredited RHI installation continues to meet the eligibility criteria;
(b)
the new installation capacity does not exceed the total intended installation capacity; and
(c)
there has not been a material change in circumstances such that, had the plan to modify capacity been notified under paragraph (2) after the change, it would have been rejected.

(b)
if as a result of the modification there is a change in the tariff category, the relevant tariff set out in Schedule 6.
(17) In calculating the initial tariff or subsequent tariff, “initial heat” in regulation 63(6) must be determined taking into account the installed peak heat output capacity of the ground source heat pump or pumps added as part of the modification.
(18) The addition of any ground source heat pump or pumps to an accredited RHI installation in accordance with a plan approved under this regulation does not alter the tariff end date or the tariff lifetime for that installation.
Budget allocation for modification of installation capacity — shared ground loop systems
52B.—(1) The Secretary of State may—
(a)
determine and publish a budget allocation for modifying installation capacity under regulation 52A (“budget allocation”) for any of the financial years 2021/2022, 2022/2023 and 2023/2024;
(b)
review the budget allocation for a current or future financial year; and

(b)
load factors applicable for each relevant technology.
(3) The Authority must consider plans to modify capacity in the order in which it receives notification of them under regulation 52A(2).
(4) Where the Secretary of State publishes a budget allocation for a financial year, the Authority must not approve a plan to modify capacity where the estimated total modified capacity commitment for a financial year would exceed the budget allocation for that year if the plan were approved.
(5) Following an increase in budget allocation pursuant to paragraph (1)(c), or any decrease in the estimated total modified capacity commitment resulting from the withdrawal or rejection of a plan to modify capacity, the Authority must proceed to consider outstanding plans in the order in which it receives notification of them under regulation 52A(2).
(6) In this regulation—
“estimated annual payment”, in relation to a plan to modify the installation capacity of a plant under regulation 52A, means—
C x LF x H x T x I
where—
(i)
C is the expected installation capacity of the plant following the modification;
(ii)
LF is the heat load factor for the plant’s technology, published by the Secretary of State under paragraph (2);

(iv)
T is the tariff which will apply under regulation 52A(16); and
(v)
I is the estimate of inflation for a financial year, published by the Secretary of State under paragraph (2);
“estimated total modified capacity commitment”, in relation to a financial year, means the sum of the estimated annual payments for every plan to modify capacity which has not been withdrawn by the applicant or rejected by the Authority;
“financial year” means a 12 month period commencing on 1st April and ending with the following 31st March;

Parliamentary Under Secretary of State
Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy
At 2.00 p.m. on 25th January 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/928) (“the 2014 Regulations”) and the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/611) (“the 2018 Regulations”). The 2014 Regulations and 2018 Regulations provide for schemes under which owners of plants which generate heat from specified renewable sources and meet specified criteria, and producers of biomethane for injection, may receive payments at prescribed tariffs for heat used for eligible purposes. The 2018 Regulations continue the Non-Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive scheme established by the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/2860).
Part 1 provides for different coming into force dates. Provisions for closure of the Non-Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive scheme (“Scheme closure”) and extension applications come into force on 1st March 2021. Amendments to Part 5 of the 2018 Regulations in relation to biomass come into force on 1st April 2022. Amendments to the 2014 Regulations and all other amendments to the 2018 Regulations come into force on 1st April 2021.
Part 2 amends the 2014 Regulations. Regulation 3 provides for a new code of practice which applies to investors from 1st April 2021. Regulation 4 extends the time for making an accreditation application where a plant has a first commissioning date on or after 1st March 2019. Regulation 5 enables a further accreditation application to be made where the original application was rejected before 1st April 2021 because it was not received within 12 months of the first commissioning date. Regulation 6 substitutes tables used to calculate the initial tariff for the Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme.
Chapters 1 to 9 of Part 3 amend the 2018 Regulations. Chapter 1 amends definitions.
In Chapter 2, regulation 9 provides for Scheme closure, extension applications and a budget cap for extension applications for the 2022/2023 financial year. Regulation 10 removes provisions not required after Scheme closure.
Chapter 3 makes amendments consequential on Scheme closure and extension applications. Regulation 14 inserts regulation 32A which prevents payments being made under both the Non-Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive scheme and the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation for the same proportion of biomethane.
Chapter 4 makes amendments in relation to biogas.
Chapter 5 provides for the fuel quality criteria.
In Chapter 6, regulation 23 enables periodic support payments to be made in respect of increased installation capacity of shared ground loop systems and provides for budget caps for this measure until the financial year 2023/2024. Regulation 25 enables the registration of an existing producer of biomethane for injection to be transferred to a new producer.
Chapter 7 makes consequential provision in relation to periodic support payments. Regulation 32 provides for the reduction of payments where a participant producing biogas from anaerobic digestion uses feedstock derived from fossil fuel. Regulation 33 provides that the calculation of periodic support payments to a producer of biomethane for injection is subject to the restriction on payments contained in regulation 32A (interaction with the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation). Regulation 33 enables a participant to notify a proportion of biomethane, and for periodic support payments to be calculated on the basis of that proportion.
In Chapter 8, regulation 35 makes clear that the restriction on tariff start dates in regulation 3A(5) applies where an application for accreditation or registration is rejected but subsequently accepted following a review under regulation 86 of the 2018 Regulations. Regulation 36 removes the obligation for quarterly reports.
Chapter 9 extends the information requirements of Schedule 2 to extension applications and applications to modify the installation capacity of shared ground loop systems, inserts Schedule 2A which requires specific evidence for extension applications and inserts Schedule 4A which provides standards for woodfuel quality.

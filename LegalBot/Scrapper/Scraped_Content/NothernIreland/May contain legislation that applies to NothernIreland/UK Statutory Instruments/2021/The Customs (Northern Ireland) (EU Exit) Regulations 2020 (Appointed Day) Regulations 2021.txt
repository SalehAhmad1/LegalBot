3rd September 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force for certain purposes the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Customs (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1605). Chapter 5 provides for the relief or repayment of duty for all goods charged under section 30A(3) and for non-domestic goods charged under section 40A(1) where such relief or repayment would not breach de minimis state aid limits. Chapter 5 is consequently in force in respect of all claims for relief of duty which are made in a customs declaration.
A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared for this instrument as it contains no substantive changes to tax policy and are appointed day regulations.NOTE AS TO EARLIER COMMENCEMENT REGULATIONS

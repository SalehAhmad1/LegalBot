(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a) to (e) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of road tunnel safety and, in particular, amend legislation relating to derogations for innovative techniques.
Part 2 amends domestic subordinate legislation. It makes amendments to the Road Tunnel Safety Regulations 2007 (S.I. 2007/1520, as amended by S.I. 2009/64), which implemented the European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/54/EC on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the trans-European road network (OJ No L 167, 30.4.24, p 39). A corrigendum to the Directive can be found in O.J. L.201, 7.6.2004, p. 56.
The amendments in these Regulations adjust language and references to recognise that the United Kingdom is no longer a member State of the European Union.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the business or voluntary sector is foreseen.

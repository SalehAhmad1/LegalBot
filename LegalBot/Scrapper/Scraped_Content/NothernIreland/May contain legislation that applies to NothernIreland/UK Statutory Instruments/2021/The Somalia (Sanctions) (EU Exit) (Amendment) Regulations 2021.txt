8th July 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
The Regulations make amendments and corrections to the Somalia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/642) (“the Somalia Regulations”) which were made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act.
The Regulations amend the Somalia Regulations to insert a new entry in the table in paragraph 3(4) in Part 3 of Schedule 2 (definition of “IED component”). This is to implement the improvised explosive devices (IED) component ban in accordance with the obligation in paragraph 26 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2551 (2020) adopted on 12 November 2020. Consequential amendments have been made to the list of the relevant UN obligations in regulation 4.
The Regulations insert a description of technology in paragraph 3 in Part 3 of Schedule 2 for the purposes of the definition of “IED component technology” (contained in regulation 19). This corrects an inadvertent omission from the Somalia Regulations. A typographical correction is also made to paragraph 3(6) in Part 3 of Schedule 2.
The Regulations also amend the Somalia Regulations to omit the reference to Tetryl in the table in paragraph 3(4) in Part 3 of Schedule 2 since it is already subject to the arms embargo in Part 5 of those regulations by virtue of being specified in Schedule 2 of the Export Control Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/3231).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. Instead a de minimis assessment has been prepared as this instrument is likely to entail some costs for businesses, but the net impact is estimated to be below £5 million per year.

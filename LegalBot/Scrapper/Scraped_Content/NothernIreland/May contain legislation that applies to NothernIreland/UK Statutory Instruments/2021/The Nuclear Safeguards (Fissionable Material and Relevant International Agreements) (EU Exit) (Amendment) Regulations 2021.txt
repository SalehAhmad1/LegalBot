(This note is not part of the Regulations)
With effect from IP completion day, the United Kingdom’s domestic nuclear safeguards regime is set out in the Energy Act 2013 (c. 32) (the “Act”) as amended by the Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018 (c. 15), the Nuclear Safeguards (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/196) and the Nuclear Safeguards (Fissionable Material and Relevant International Agreements) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/195). These Regulations amend S.I. 2019/195.
Section 112(1A) of the Act defines “relevant international agreement” as an agreement (whether or not ratified) which the United Kingdom is a party to, relates to nuclear safeguards and is specified by the Secretary of State in regulations made under section 112(1B) of the Act. Regulation 3 of S.I. 2019/195 specifies the international agreements which constitute a “relevant international agreement” for this purpose.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends S.I. 2019/195 to add the Protocol Amending the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Japan for Co-operation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, signed in London on 16 December 2020, (the “Amending Protocol”) as a relevant international agreement specified by the Secretary of State for the purpose of section 112(1A).

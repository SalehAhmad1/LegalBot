1 December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2017 (“the 2017 Regulations”) and the Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2018 (“the 2018 Regulations”).
Amendments made by these Regulations ensure that full effect is given to the EU withdrawal agreement as it relates to the rights of those making late applications to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS) and to future joining family members who have yet to apply to the EUSS and are still within the deadline for doing so.
Existing provisions relating to eligibility of students to receive Welsh student support are amended so that persons (other than certain Irish citizens) who come to Wales from the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands for the purpose of study are not eligible for tuition fee support.
Amendments are also made to the 2017 Regulations and the 2018 Regulations to make Irish citizens living in the EEA or Switzerland at the end of the transition period eligible for student support if starting courses in Wales on or before 31 December 2027.
These Regulations also make corresponding amendments to—
The Education (Fees and Awards) (Wales) Regulations 2007;
The Higher Education (Qualifying Courses, Qualifying Persons and Supplementary Provision) (Wales) Regulations 2015;
The Education (Postgraduate Master’s Degree Loans) (Wales) Regulations 2017;
The Education (Postgraduate Doctoral Degree Loans) (Wales) Regulations 2018;
The Education (Student Support) (Postgraduate Master’s Degrees) (Wales) Regulations 2019.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Higher Education Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

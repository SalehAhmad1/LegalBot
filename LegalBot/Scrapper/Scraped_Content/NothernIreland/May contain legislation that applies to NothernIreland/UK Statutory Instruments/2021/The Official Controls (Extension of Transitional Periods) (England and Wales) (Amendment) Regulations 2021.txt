(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Official Controls (Extension of Transitional Periods) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/809) to remove one of the provisions appointing the end date in England and Wales for “the transitional staging period” (defined in Annex 6 to Regulation (EU) 2017/625 (EUR 2017/625)) in respect of documentary checks for products of animal origin and certain types of animal by-product.
The Regulations also amend Regulation (EU) 2017/625 and the Trade in Animals and Related Products Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1197) (“TARP Regulations”) to change the date from which the requirement for prior notification of imports into England (and, in the case of Regulation (EU) 2017/625, England and Wales) of products of animal origin applies to 1st January 2022. The TARP Regulations are also amended to remove the provision for a health certificate for products of animal origin and certain types of animal by-product to be required for these goods before the end of the transitional staging period.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

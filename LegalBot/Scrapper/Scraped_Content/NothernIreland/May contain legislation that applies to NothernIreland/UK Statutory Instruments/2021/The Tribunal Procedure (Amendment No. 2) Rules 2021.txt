Rule 2 amends the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Property Chamber) Rules 2013 (S.I. 2013/1169) to allow for costs to be awarded in proceedings under Part 4A of Schedule 3A to the Communications Act 2003.
Rule 3 amends the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory Chamber) Rules 2009 (S.I. 2009/1976) to ensure that the time limit for making an application for a costs order applies in relation to a deemed withdrawal in the same way as it applies to a withdrawal which takes effect following a notice of withdrawal by a party.

28th October 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations provide for temporary exceptions to some of the requirements in Articles 6 and 8 of Regulation (EC) 561/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport (“Drivers’ Hours Regulation”). The Drivers’ Hours Regulation forms part of retained EU law.
The temporary exceptions provide for some relaxations in respect of drivers’ hours and rest periods for the period from 1st November 2021 to 9th January 2022 and are made as a response to the adverse impact on the carriage by road of goods caused by the exceptional circumstances arising from cumulative impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and an acute shortage of goods vehicle drivers. Regulation 5 provides that these Regulations cease to have effect on 10th January 2022 (at the end of the relaxation period during which the temporary exceptions apply).

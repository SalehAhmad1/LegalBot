At 9.43 a.m. on 1st October 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel and Operator Liability) (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/582) (“the International Travel Regulations”).
Regulation 6 inserts a new Part 1B into the International Travel Regulations and creates a new category of traveller known as an “eligible traveller” who if fully vaccinated and arriving in England from a list of specified countries, is exempted from the need to comply with the obligation to have proof of a negative test on arrival, to take a “day 8 test” or to self-isolate.
Regulations 8 to 12 make amendments to the existing categories of exemption from the on-going obligations of the International Travel Regulations to travellers other than eligible travellers.
Regulation 13 relieves operators of the obligation to check evidence of vaccination where a traveller’s Passenger Locator Form has had appropriate evidence uploaded to it, and which states that the evidence has been verified.
Regulation 20 has the effect that all countries and territories that are not specified for the purposes of Part 1B in relation to eligible travellers are category 2 countries and territories (known as “amber-list countries and territories”) and no country or territory is listed in category 1 (“green-list”).
Regulation 25 changes the nature of the medical evidence that travellers from category 3 countries and territories (known as “red-list countries and territories”) must provide if they seek exemption from the obligation to quarantine in designated accommodation.
Regulation 26 changes the information that operators must give to passengers to reflect the changes made by these Regulations.
The other provisions of these Regulations make minor and consequential amendments.

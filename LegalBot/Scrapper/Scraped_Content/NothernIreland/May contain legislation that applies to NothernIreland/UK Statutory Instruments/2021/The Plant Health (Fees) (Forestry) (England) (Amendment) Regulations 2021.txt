3rd June 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Plant Health (Fees) (Forestry) (England and Scotland) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/350) (in relation to England only) to provide for increases in the fees for services in relation to plant passport authorities and applications for phytosanitary certificates (including phytosanitary certificates for re-export) to reflect an inflationary rise in the cost of providing those services since the introduction of those fees. The fees relating to plant passport authorities have increased by 34% for the period between 2006 and 2020, while fees for export certification have increased by 40% for the period between 2004 and 2020 (based on the Consumer Price Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH)).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

This Order confers on the Port Authority and the harbour master (defined in article 2) powers of general and special direction for the regulation and management of the harbour (articles 4 to 10).
The powers of general direction are extended to include the regulation of vehicles in the port and provision is made for a register of all in force general directions which may be inspected during working hours at the main office of the Port Authority (article 4).
This Order creates an offence of failing to comply with special or general directions, the penalty for which is a fine on summary conviction not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale (article 8).
A defence of due diligence is available to a person charged under article 8 (article 8(2)).

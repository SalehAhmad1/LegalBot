(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes provision about the application of certain provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (“the Act”) to Anguilla and to Pitcairn, Henderson, Ducie and Oeno Islands (“the Pitcairn Islands”).
Article 2 and the Schedule extend certain provisions of the Act to Anguilla and to the Pitcairn Islands with the modifications specified in the Schedule.
Articles 3 and 4 make consequential amendments to remove references to Anguilla and the Pitcairn Islands from the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (Overseas Territories) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/1452) and the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (Overseas Territories) (No. 2) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/3367). Those Orders extended to Anguilla and to the Pitcairn Islands modified versions of sections 61, 75 and 76(4) of the Act, but the modifications were defective as they referred to provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1949 which had never been extended to those territories.
Article 5 revokes the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (Anguilla) Order 2019 (S.I. 2019/756), which is replaced by this Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

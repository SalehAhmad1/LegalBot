Cmnd. . 487EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to various United Kingdom and Scottish public procurement regulations for the purpose of implementing the Agreement on Government Procurement and in consequence of a modification of the list of central government entities in Annex 1 to the United Kingdom’s Appendix I to the Agreement. This includes consequential amendments. The amendments made by these Regulations are “steady state amendments”, as that term is defined in the Public Procurement (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1319) and the Public Procurement etc. (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (S.S.I. 2020/468) (“the EU Exit SIs”). As such, in accordance with the transitional provisions in the EU Exit SIs, these amendments do not affect any procedure (as that term is defined in the Schedules to the EU Exit SIs) launched before but not yet finalised by IP completion day. A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen

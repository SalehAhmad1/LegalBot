(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order contains the maximum amounts a returning officer may recover for services rendered and expenses incurred for, or in connection with, the conduct of the Senedd Cymru election. This Order replaces and revokes the National Assembly for Wales (Returning Officers’ Charges) Order 2016 (S.I. 2016/417) (W. 133).
The Senedd Cymru election is to be held on the same day as the election of Police and Crime Commissioners. Therefore all amounts have taken into account the provisions contained in article 16A of the National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) Order 2007 (S.I. 2007/236) (as inserted by the National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) (Amendment) Order 2016 (S.I. 2016/272)), which requires these amounts to be apportioned equally between the Senedd Cymru election and the election of Police and Crime Commissioners.
Articles 4, 5 and 6 of this Order specify the maximum amounts for services rendered and expenses incurred for, or in connection with, a contested constituency election. The amount recoverable for services rendered is concerned with electoral administration and the discharge of duties relating to the election by returning officers and electoral administrators. Expenses incurred differentiate between standard expenses and coronavirus related expenses. The amounts are listed in the table in Schedule 1.
Articles 7, 8 and 9 specify the maximum amounts for services rendered and expenses incurred for, or in connection with, a contested regional election. The amounts are listed in the table in Schedule 2.
Article 10 specifies the maximum amount for an uncontested constituency election, whereas article 11 specifies the maximum amount for an uncontested regional election.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Order. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Order.

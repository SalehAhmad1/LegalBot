20th May 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Single Use Carrier Bags Charges (England) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/776) (“the Carrier Bags Order”).
Article 3 amends the Carrier Bags Order by omitting the expiry date of 5th October 2022 in article 1(d), by which that Order would have ceased to have effect. Articles 6, 7, 10 and 11 make amendments to the Carrier Bags Order consequential on the omission of the expiry date.
Articles 4 and 8 amend the Carrier Bags Order in order to substitute a new definition of “seller”. This brings all sellers of goods under the obligation to charge in article 3 of the Carrier Bags Order and restricts the obligation relating to records in article 4 of, and Schedule 3 to, that Order to sellers within the meaning given in Schedule 1.
Article 5 amends the Carrier Bags Order in order to increase the minimum charge for each single use carrier bag (SUCB) supplied in a reporting year from 5 pence to 10 pence.
Article 9 amends the definition of SUCB in Schedule 2 to the Carrier Bags Order by amending the list of “excluded bags” in the table.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order implements the recommendations of the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales (“the Commission”), which reported in July 2019 on its review of the electoral arrangements for the County of Pembrokeshire.

This Order implements the Commission’s recommendations, with modifications.

This Order also implements recommendations for changes to the electoral arrangements for some communities within the County of Pembrokeshire.
Article 4 makes changes to the boundaries between the community wards of Hakin, Hubberston, Central, North and East within the community of Milford Haven.
Articles 5 and 6 make changes to the boundary between the community wards of St Michael and St Mary South within the community of Pembroke, and to the number of members to be elected for these wards.

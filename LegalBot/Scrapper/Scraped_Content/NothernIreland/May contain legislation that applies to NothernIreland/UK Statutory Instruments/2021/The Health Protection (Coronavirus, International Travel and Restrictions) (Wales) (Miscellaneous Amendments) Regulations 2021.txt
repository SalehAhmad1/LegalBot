Minister for Health and Social Services, one of the Welsh MinistersEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/574 (W. 132)) (“the International Travel Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (No. 5) (Wales) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1609 (W. 335)) (“the Restrictions Regulations”).
The International Travel Regulations impose requirements on persons entering Wales after having been abroad. They include a requirement for persons arriving in Wales to isolate for a period determined in accordance with those Regulations. The requirements imposed by the International Travel Regulations are subject to exceptions, and certain categories of person are exempt from having to comply. The International Travel Regulations also make specific provisions for “regulation 2A travellers”; including individuals who have been fully vaccinated in prescribed countries and territories.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations amends regulation 2 (general interpretation) of the International Travel Regulations so as to extend the recognition of certain vaccine certificates issued by additional European countries and territories, for the purposes of pre-departure testing and vaccine travel exemptions.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations amends regulation 2A (exemptions for vaccinated travellers and others) of the International Travel Regulations to—
extend the recognition of vaccinations to further countries and territories;
broaden the definition of “authorised vaccine” by removing the requirement that it is to be administered in a relevant country and through recognising certain WHO recognised vaccines;
remove the residency requirements for travellers vaccinated in the United States of America, participants in clinical trials, and travellers under 18;
introduce further means of proof of vaccination, including approved third countries and territories certificates and certain US State vaccination certificates;
make further technical amendments including around vaccinations as part of the UK vaccine roll-out overseas.
Regulation 5 of these Regulations amends regulation 3 (persons arriving from outside the common travel area) of the International Travel Regulations to exempt the following persons from the requirement to provide passenger information when they have travelled to Wales in the course of their work (whether or not they have travelled in a passenger carrying conveyance): road haulage workers; road passenger transport workers; masters and seamen; pilots involved in merchant shipping; inspectors and surveyors of ships; and crew on aircraft.
Regulation 6 of these Regulations amends regulation 9 (isolation requirements: exemptions) of the International Travel Regulations, removing the requirement for certain diplomats to receive written authorisation from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office ahead of reliance on isolation exemption provisions. Regulation 9 is also amended so as to align isolation exemptions for road haulage workers regardless of residency status.
Regulations 7 and 8 contain consequential amendments following the amendments made by regulation 4.
Regulation 9 of these Regulations amends regulation 16A (specific measures applicable to specified hospitality and entertainment venues and premises at which specified events are held) of the Restrictions Regulations in order to maintain consistency with regulation 2A of the International Travel Regulations. This includes further extending the list of countries and territories in paragraph (12) of that regulation so that evidence of vaccination in those countries with vaccines authorised in the United Kingdom is also acceptable for the purposes of what is commonly known as the COVID-pass.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has not been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

22nd July 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend retained EU legislation relating to CO2 emissions performance targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (vans).
On 18th December 2020, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 setting CO2 emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles (OJ L 111, 25.4.2019, p. 13-53) ceased to fall within scope of Annex 2 to the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland of the EU withdrawal agreement. Consequently, that Regulation, together with the legislation implementing it, ceased to have effect in Northern Ireland.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends Regulation (EU) 2019/631 as retained in UK law (EUR 2019/631) to extend its application to vehicles registered in Northern Ireland.
Regulation 3 makes minor consequential amendments to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 114/2013 of 6 November 2012 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to rules for the application for a derogation from the specific CO2 emissions targets for new light commercial vehicles, as retained in UK law (EUR 2013/114).

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/3998) (“the Regulations”) and the Misuse of Drugs (Designation) (England, Wales and Scotland) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/704) (“the Order”).
Regulation 2 adds three benzodiazepines, being the compounds known as flualprazolam, flunitrazolam and norfludiazepam, to Schedule 1 to the Regulations. The Schedule in which a controlled drug is placed affects the extent to which the drug can be lawfully imported, exported, produced, supplied or possessed. The controlled drugs placed in Schedule 1 to the Regulations are those subject to the tightest controls, requiring a Home Office licence in order to access such drugs.
Regulation 3 adds the compounds known as flualprazolam, flunitrazolam and norfludiazepam to Schedule 1 to the Order. Section 7(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 requires the Secretary of State to make regulations to allow drugs controlled under that Act to be used for medicinal purposes. Section 7(3), however, does not apply to any drug which is designated by order under section 7(4) of that Act. Controlled drugs are designated where the Secretary of State is of the opinion that it is in the public interest for production, supply and possession of that drug to be either wholly unlawful or unlawful except for research or other special purposes, or for medicinal use of the drug to be unlawful except under licence. Schedule 1 to the Order specifies the list of controlled drugs to which section 7(4) applies.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary, or public sectors is foreseen.

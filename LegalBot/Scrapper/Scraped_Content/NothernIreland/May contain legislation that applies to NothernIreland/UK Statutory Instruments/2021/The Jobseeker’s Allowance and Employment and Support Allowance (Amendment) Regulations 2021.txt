(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/378) (“the JSA Regulations”) and the Employment and Support Allowance Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/379) (“the ESA Regulations”) so as to correct an error made in the Social Security (Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit) (Amendment) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/678) (“the 2016 Regulations”).
The 2016 Regulations omitted sub-paragraph (a) of regulation 18(4) of the JSA Regulations and sub-paragraph (a) of regulation 51(4) of the ESA Regulations whereas they should have omitted the whole of paragraph (4) of each of the respective Regulations. These Regulations correct that error and omit paragraph (4) of regulation 18 of the JSA Regulations, in its entirety, and paragraph (4) of regulation 51 of the ESA Regulations, also in its entirety. The omission of those paragraphs ensures that the provisions in Part 3 of the JSA Regulations and Part 8 of the ESA Regulations can operate effectively. Those provisions set out the length of a sanction where a benefit claimant fails to comply with a work-related requirement.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

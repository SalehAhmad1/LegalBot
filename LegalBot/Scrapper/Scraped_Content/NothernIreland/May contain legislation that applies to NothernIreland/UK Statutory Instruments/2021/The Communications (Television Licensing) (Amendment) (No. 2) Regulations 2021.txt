(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004 (“the 2004 Regulations”) (S.I. 2004/692) to make provision for the form of TV licence known as a “simple payment plan licence (not black and white only)” (a “simple payment licence”) to be available from 1st May 2021 to eligible television licence fee payers who are resident in the Isle of Man.
Regulation 2 extends the provisions relating to the simple payment licence (Part 4 of Schedule 2 to the 2004 Regulations) to the Isle of Man.
Regulation 5 amends paragraph 20 of Schedule 2 to the 2004 Regulations so that a person in the Isle of Man is eligible for a simple payment licence if they have, within the period of 6 months ending with the issue date, received advice in relation to any of the person’s financial obligations from a debt advice charity that is registered in the Isle of Man or from the Isle of Man Office of Fair Trading.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as there will be no impact on the private sector and negligible impact on the voluntary sectors is foreseen.

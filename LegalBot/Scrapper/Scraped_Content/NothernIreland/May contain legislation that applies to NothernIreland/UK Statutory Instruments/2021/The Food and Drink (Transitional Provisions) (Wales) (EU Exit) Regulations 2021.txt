(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred on the Welsh Ministers by paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21(b) of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations insert transitional provisions into subordinate legislation applying in relation to Wales in the field of food and drink standards and labelling and relate to amendments to retained EU law made by other EU Exit statutory instruments.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

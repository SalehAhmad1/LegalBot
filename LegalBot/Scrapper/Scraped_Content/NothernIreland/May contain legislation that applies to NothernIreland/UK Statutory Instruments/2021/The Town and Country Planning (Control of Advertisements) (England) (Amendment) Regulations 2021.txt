The inserted regulation 21B provides that where a flag from Schedule 1 is displayed in conjunction with a flag from Schedule 3, the flag from Schedule 1 must be flown in a superior position to that from Schedule 3. The regulation also provides that where one of the flags flown is the Union flag, that flag must be flown in a superior position to the other flag and that not more than one flag from Schedule 3 may be displayed.

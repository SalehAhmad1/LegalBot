Regulation 2(1) brings into force the definitions of “domestic abuse” and “personally connected” in sections 1 and 2 respectively of the Act. The definitions are commenced only for the purposes of: section 76 of the Act, which is brought into force for limited purposes by these Regulations; sections 75 and 83 of the Act, which were brought into force on the day on which the Act was passed in accordance with section 90(1) of the Act; sections 177, 179, 189 and 198 of the Housing Act 1996 (c. 52) (“the 1996 Act”) and article 6 of the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/2051) which are amended by section 78 of the Act, which is brought into force by these Regulations.

Section 78(8) amends article 6 of the Homelessness (Priority Need for Accommodation) (England) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/2051).

7th April 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) (England) Regulations 2020 to add upcoming events, and remove finished events, from the list of specified competitions in Schedule 3 to those Regulations. That list is relevant to the exemption for sportspersons from self-isolation.
An amendment is also made to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Public Health Information for International Passengers) (England) Regulations 2020 to modify the information required to be provided, by operators, to passengers departing England. This change reflects that, following the introduction of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Steps) (England) Regulations 2021 and removal of the ‘Stay at Home’ requirement, a person may no longer be directed to return to the place where they are living but may still be directed to leave an embarkation point.

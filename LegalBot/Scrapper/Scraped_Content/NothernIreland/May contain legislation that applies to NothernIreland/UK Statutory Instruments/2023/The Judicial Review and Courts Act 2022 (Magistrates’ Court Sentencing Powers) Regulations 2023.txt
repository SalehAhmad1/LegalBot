(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument is made under section 13(10) of the Judicial Review and Courts Act 2022 (c. 35).
Part 2 of these regulations amends both primary and secondary legislation to reflect the changes made by section 224 of the Sentencing Act 2020 (c. 17) which specifies that the maximum penalty that the magistrates’ court may impose is 6 months for a summary offence and 12 months for a triable either way offence. Prior to 2 May 2022 the maximum penalty for a triable either way offence was 6 months. The maximum sentence for a triable either way offence is now the general limit in the magistrates’ court. Accordingly, this instrument makes necessary amendments to reflect this. Amendments also include changes to Welsh language text. The required substitutions are set out in Part 1 and 2 of the tables to the Schedule.
Parts 3 and 4 of these regulations make specific amendments to primary and secondary legislation for the same purpose as Part 2 above.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

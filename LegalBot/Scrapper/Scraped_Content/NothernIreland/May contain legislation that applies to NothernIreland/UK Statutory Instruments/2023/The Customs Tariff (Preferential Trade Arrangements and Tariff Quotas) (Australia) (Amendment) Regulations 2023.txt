(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (c. 22). They amend the Customs Tariff (Preferential Trade Arrangements) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1457) to implement preferential customs import duty rates agreed under the Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Australia, signed on 16th December 2021. They also amend the Customs (Tariff Quotas) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1432), as a consequence of that free trade arrangement.
Regulation 2 amends Schedule 1 to S.I. 2020/1457, which sets out the list of arrangements between His Majesty’s government in the United Kingdom and the governments of other countries or territories to which the provisions of those Regulations apply. The following preferential trade arrangement is, by this instrument, inserted in the table in Schedule 1 to S.I. 2020/1457:
— Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Australia, signed on 16th December 2021.
Regulation 3 amends S.I. 2020/1432 to establish seven new tariff rate quotas which will be administered using a licencing system. Regulation 3 also establishes the conditions to be met for an import licence to be issued in respect of these seven tariff rate quotas.

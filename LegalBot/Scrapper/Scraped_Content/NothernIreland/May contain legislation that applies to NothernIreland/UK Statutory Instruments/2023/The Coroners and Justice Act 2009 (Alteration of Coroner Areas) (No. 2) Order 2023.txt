(This note is not part of the Order)
Schedule 2 to the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (c. 25) divided England and Wales into coroner areas. It established that the Lord Chancellor may, by order, both specify and alter these. Subsequently, the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Coroner Areas and Assistant Coroners) Transitional Order 2013 (S.I. 2013/1625), which came into force on 25th July 2013, established that certain “coroner’s districts” - as constituted under the Coroners Act 1988 (c. 13) - were to be specified as coroner areas.
This Order combines two coroner areas into one new coroner area, called Staffordshire & Stoke on Trent.

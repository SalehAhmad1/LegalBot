Protective Provisions
PART 1
For the protection of Anglian Water Services Limited
Application
1.  For the protection of Anglian Water the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Anglian Water.
Interpretation
2.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“Act” means the Water Industry Act 1991;
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable Anglian Water to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner no less efficient than previously;
“Anglian Water” means Anglian Water Services Limited;
“apparatus” means Anglian Water’s twin water mains running between Stamford Road, King’s Cliffe (at grid references TL0130899796 and TL0131499784 or thereabouts) and A43, Duddington (at grid references SK9888300433 and SK9888000429 or thereabouts, respectively) and includes:
(a)
any accessories (as defined by section 219 of the Act) forming part of it;
(b)
any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to it; and
(c)
alternative apparatus;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in”, in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land, includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land;
“plan” includes all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably necessary properly and sufficiently to describe the works to be executed;
Acquisition of land
3.  Regardless of any provision in this Order, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Retained apparatus
4.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus (or any means of access to it) the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker in accordance with section 185 of the Act, the undertaker must submit to Anglian Water a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only (i) if approved by Anglian Water pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) below, (ii) in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and (iii) in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Anglian Water for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Anglian Water is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Anglian Water under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it. The approval that may be given under that sub-paragraph must not be unreasonably withheld (although may be subject to the said requirements) and must be assumed to have been given unless Anglian Water gives written notice to the undertaker that it is being withheld entirely or given subject to the said requirements within the same time period.
(4) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(5) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give to Anglian Water notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances, using its best endeavours to keep the impact of those emergency works on Anglian Water’s apparatus, on the operation of its water and sewerage network and on end-users of the services Anglian Water provides to a minimum.
(6) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) and without prejudice to the generality of the principles set out in that sub-paragraph—
(a)
the establishment of an access way or haul road and underground works are both deemed to be “works” for the purposes of this paragraph; and
(b)
works are deemed to be in land near Anglian Water’s apparatus if those works fall within 20 metres measured from the medial line of the closer of the two water mains forming such apparatus to the works in question.
Expenses and costs
5.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Anglian Water all expenses reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Anglian Water by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
6.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of—
(a)
the construction of any works of authorised development for which development consent is granted by this Order;
(b)
any subsidence resulting from such works or development; or
(c)
any leakage, leachate or radiation resulting from such works or development;
any contamination or damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works), any medium conveyed by such apparatus or any property of Anglian Water, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Anglian Water, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Anglian Water for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty (whether legal, regulatory or in relation to regulatory funding) or costs incurred by the undertaker;
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Anglian Water on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Anglian Water or in accordance with any requirement of Anglian Water or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Anglian Water fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and professional like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to:
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the unlawful or unreasonable act, neglect or default of Anglian Water, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any part of the authorised development carried out by Anglian Water in the exercise of any functions conferred by this Order pursuant to a transfer of benefit under article 7; or
(c)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working) arising from any such damage or interruption, which is not reasonably foreseeable.
(4) Anglian Water must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made, without the consent of the undertaker (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(5) Anglian Water must act reasonably in relation to any claim or demand served under sub-paragraph (1) and use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which a claim or demand under sub-paragraph (1) applies.

(a)
Any leak detection monitoring and pipe bedding monitoring to be installed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such situation as may be agreed between Anglian Water and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration).
(b)
Anglian Water must, after the leak detection monitoring and pipe bedding monitoring to be installed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 20, and after the grant to Anglian Water of any such necessary facilities and rights over the land, proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the agreed leak detection monitoring and pipe bedding monitoring.
(c)
The undertaker must repay to Anglian Water all expenses reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in, or in connection with, the installation of any leak detection and pipe bedding monitoring apparatus.
(d)
If Anglian Water gives notice in writing to the undertaker that it desires the undertaker to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the installation of leak detection or pipe bedding monitoring apparatus or the undertaker and Anglian Water otherwise agree, that work, instead of being executed by Anglian Water, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water at the cost of the undertaker.
(e)
Anglian Water must share all monitoring data arising from the installation of the leak detection monitoring and pipe bedding monitoring with the undertaker on a quarterly basis.

12.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and WPD are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
No acquisition except by agreement
13.  Regardless of any provision in this Order, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
14.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker requires that apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of WPD to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, alternative rights acquired or granted for the alternative apparatus and the alternative apparatus is in operation and access to it has been provided if necessary to the reasonable satisfaction of WPD in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (10) or with such alternative or supplementary provisions as the undertaker and WPD may agree between them.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to WPD written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) If as a direct consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order WPD reasonably needs to remove or divert any of its apparatus and the removal of that apparatus has not been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) then WPD must give to the undertaker written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and this Part has effect as if the removal or diversion of such apparatus had been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (2).
(4) If as a direct consequence of the removal or diversion of apparatus under sub-paragraph (2) or (3) alternative apparatus is to be constructed in land owned or controlled by the undertaker then the undertaker must afford to WPD the necessary facilities alternative rights and any necessary third party consent or approvals for the construction of alternative apparatus in the other land owned or controlled by the undertaker.
(5) If the undertaker or WPD requires to remove or divert any apparatus placed within the Order land and alternative apparatus is to be constructed in land not owned or controlled by the undertaker as a consequence of the removal or diversion of apparatus then WPD must use its reasonable endeavours to obtain alternative rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(6) If alternative apparatus is to be constructed in land not owned or controlled by the undertaker and WPD is unable to obtain such alternative rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker and WPD must consider whether there is an alternative engineering solution that can achieve the diversion without the need for the use of compulsory powers. Should such an alternative engineering solution not be practicable and deliverable in a reasonable timescale and at a reasonable cost (which must be determined by the undertaker acting reasonably), WPD may but must not be compelled to use the powers of compulsory acquisition set out in this Order or the Electricity Act 1989 to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land outside the Order limits in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed in accordance with a timetable agreed between WPD and the undertaker.
(7) Any alternative apparatus required pursuant to sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between WPD and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled in accordance with paragraph 19.
(8) WPD must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled pursuant to paragraph 19, and after the acquisition by or grant to WPD of any such facilities and alternative rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) to (6), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(9) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (8), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to WPD that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by WPD, must be executed by the undertaker—
(a)
in accordance with plans and specifications and in such line or situation agreed between the undertaker and WPD, or, in default of agreement, determined in accordance with paragraph 19; and
(b)
without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of WPD.
(10) Nothing in sub-paragraph (9) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus or alternative apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus or alternative apparatus (where the apparatus or alternative apparatus is laid in a trench) within 600 millimetres of the point of connection or disconnection.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
15.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to WPD facilities and alternative rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and alternative rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and WPD or in default of agreement settled in accordance with paragraph 19.
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in the land of the undertaker, the expert must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the undertaker for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the authorised development and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the undertaker;
(b)
have regard to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted;
(c)
have regard to WPD’s ability to fulfil its service obligations and comply with its licence conditions; and
(d)
have regard to the standard form rights WPD ordinarily secures for the type of alternative apparatus to be constructed in the circumstances similar to the authorised development.
(3) If the facilities and alternative rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and alternative rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the expert less favourable on the whole to WPD than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the expert must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to WPD as appears to the expert to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
16.—(1) Not less than 60 days before the undertaker intends to start the execution of any specified work where the removal of the apparatus in question has not been required under paragraph 14, the undertaker must submit to WPD a plan of the works to be executed. Any submission must note the time limits imposed on WPD under sub-paragraph (3) below.
(2) Subject to sub-paragraph (3) below the undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (1) applies until WPD has identified any reasonable requirements it has for the alteration or protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it.
(3) If by the expiry of 60 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted WPD has not advised the undertaker in writing of any reasonable requirements for the alteration or protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, it must be deemed not to have any such requirements and the undertaker must be at liberty to proceed with the works.
(4) The works referred to in sub-paragraph (1) must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with any reasonable requirements as may be notified in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) by WPD and WPD must be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(5) At all times when carrying out the authorised development the undertaker must comply with WPD’s Avoidance of Danger from Electricity Overhead Lines and Underground Cables (2014), the Energy Network Association’s A Guide to the Safe Use of Mechanical Plant in the Vicinity of Electricity Overhead Lines (undated), the Health and Safety Executive’s GS6 Avoiding Danger from Overhead Power Lines and the Health and Safety Executive’s HSG47 Avoiding Danger from Underground Services (Third Addition) (2014) as the same may be replaced from time to time.
(6) If WPD, in accordance with sub–paragraph (2) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal or diversion of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, this Part of this Schedule applies as if the removal or diversion of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 14(2).
(7) Nothing in this paragraph 16 precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 60 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(8) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub–paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to WPD notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with any reasonable requirements stipulated by WPD under sub-paragraph (2) and with sub–paragraphs (4) and (5) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. Nothing in this sub-paragraph prevents WPD from exercising its rights under sub-paragraph (6).
Expenses and costs
17.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to WPD the proper and reasonable expenses reasonably incurred by WPD in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, diversion, alteration or protection of any apparatus, the construction of any alternative apparatus and the acquisition or grant of alternative rights for the alternative apparatus, arising as a result of the powers conferred upon the undertaker pursuant to this Order.
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule WPD requires that alternative apparatus of better type, of greater capacity, of greater dimensions or at a greater depth is necessary in substitution for existing apparatus which for WPD’s network requirements is over and above what is necessary as a consequence of and for the purpose of the authorised development, WPD must reduce the cost of such additional requirements from the amount payable by the undertaker pursuant to sub-paragraph (1).
(4) For the purposes of sub–paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of paragraph 18(1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
18.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (2), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any specified work or any subsidence resulting from any of those works any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of WPD the undertaker is to—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by WPD in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
reimburse WPD for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs reasonably and properly incurred by WPD, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of WPD, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) WPD must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, is to have the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(4) WPD must act reasonably in relation to any claim or demand served under sub-paragraph (1) and use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which a claim or demand under sub-paragraph (1) applies.
(5) WPD’s liability to the undertaker for negligence or breach of contract, in respect of each diversion, must be limited to the value of that diversion and WPD must not otherwise be liable to the undertaker for any losses or costs incurred by the undertaker resulting from delays to the authorised development as a result of its failure to undertake works to deliver any alternative apparatus.
Expert determination
19.—(1) Article 20 (arbitration) must apply to any difference as to the legal interpretation of this Schedule and as provided for in sub–paragraph (7).
(2) Save as provided for in sub–paragraph (1) or sub–paragraph (7) any difference under this Part of this Schedule must be referred to and settled by a single independent and suitable person who holds appropriate professional qualifications and is a member of a professional body relevant to the matter in dispute acting as an expert, such person to be agreed by the differing parties or, in the absence of agreement, identified by the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers or the President of the Institution of RICS or the President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (as relevant and agreed between WPD and the undertaker, both acting reasonably and without delay).
(3) All parties involved in settling any difference must use best endeavours to do so within 14 days from the date of a dispute first being notified in writing by one party to the other and in the absence of the difference being settled within that period the expert must be appointed within 21 days of the notification of the dispute.
(4) The costs and fees of the expert and the costs of WPD and the undertaker are payable by the parties in such proportions as the expert may determine. In the absence of such determination the costs and fees of the expert are payable equally by the parties who must each bear their own costs.
(5) The expert must—
(a)
invite the parties to make submission to the expert in writing and copied to the other party to be received by the expert within 14 days of the expert’s appointment;
(b)
permit a party to comment on the submissions made by the other party within 7 days of receipt of the submission;
(c)
issue a decision within 14 days of receipt of the submissions under sub-paragraph (b); and
(d)
give reasons for the decision.
(6) The expert must consider where relevant—
(a)
the development outcome sought by the undertaker;
(b)
the ability of the undertaker to achieve its outcome in a timely and cost-effective manner;
(c)
the nature of the power sought to be exercised by the undertaker;
(d)
the effectiveness, cost and reasonableness of proposals for mitigation arising from any party;
(e)
WPD’s service obligations and licence conditions; and
(f)
any other important and relevant consideration.

(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 28 or 29 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, must not be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
24.—(1) If, the undertaker acquires any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), secure any necessary consents for the alternative apparatus and afford to National Grid to its reasonable satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 27(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation must not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker.
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to a written diversion agreement having been entered into between the parties and the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
25.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Grid facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Grid.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 32 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of gas undertaker
26.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan and, if reasonably required by National Grid, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within (i) 15 metres measured in any direction of any apparatus, or (ii) involve embankment works within 15 metres of any apparatus, the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply until National Grid has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (5) or (7); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (1) and/or (2) apply, National Grid may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works executed under sub-paragraphs (1) or (2) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (5), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) or (7) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where National Grid requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Grids’ satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and National Grid must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(8) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) or (7) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 20 to 22 and 25 to 27 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 24(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and comply with sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(11) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under this Order National Grid must comply with National Grid’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “Specification for safe working in the vicinity of National Grid, High pressure Gas pipelines and associated installation requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22” and HSE’s “HS(~G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
(12) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that National Grid retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 27.
Expenses
27.—(1) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Grid and the undertaker and subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid within 30 days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim from National Grid all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 24(3); or
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 32 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
28.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods or energy, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid and including Network Code Claims other than arising from any default of National Grid.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless National Grid fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) must impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any authorised works and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by National Grid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of this Order pursuant to section 156 of the 2008 Act or article 7 (consent to transfer benefit of order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section 3 will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 28.
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) National Grid must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) Not to commence construction (and not to permit the commencement of such construction) of the authorised works on any land owned by National Grid or in respect of which National Grid has an easement or wayleave for its apparatus or any other interest or to carry out any works within 15 metres of National Grid’s apparatus until the following conditions are satisfied:
(a)
unless and until National Grid is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has first provided the acceptable security (and provided evidence that it must maintain such acceptable security for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and National Grid has confirmed the same to the undertaker in writing; and
(b)
unless and until National Grid is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to National Grid that it must maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised works which constitute specified works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and National Grid has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker.
(7) In the event that the undertaker fails to comply with paragraph 26(6) of this Part of this Schedule, nothing in this Part of this Schedule must prevent National Grid from seeking injunctive relief (or any other equitable remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Enactments and agreements
29.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between National Grid and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
30.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised works, the undertaker or National Grid requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 24(2) or National Grid makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 26 the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised works and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Grid’s undertaking and National Grid must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever National Grid’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
31.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 23(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
32.  Any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Grid under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 20 (arbitration).
Notices
33.  Notwithstanding article 19 (service of notices), any plans submitted to National Grid by the undertaker pursuant to this Part must be submitted using the LSBUD system (https://lsbud.co.uk/) or such other address as National Grid may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker in writing.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations put in place a measure required to implement the Electronic Travel Authorisation (“ETA”) scheme introduced by the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 (c. 36).
Section 75(6) of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 amended section 126(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (c. 41) to add an application for an ETA to the types of immigration application which the Secretary of State may require by regulations to be accompanied by specified biometric information. Regulation 2 of these Regulations makes a consequential amendment to the Immigration (Provision of Physical Data) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/1743) to add an application for an ETA to the types of immigration application for which compulsory biometric information may be required.
A full impact assessment of the effect that the ETA scheme will have on the costs to business, charity and voluntary bodies and the public sector has been prepared but not published.

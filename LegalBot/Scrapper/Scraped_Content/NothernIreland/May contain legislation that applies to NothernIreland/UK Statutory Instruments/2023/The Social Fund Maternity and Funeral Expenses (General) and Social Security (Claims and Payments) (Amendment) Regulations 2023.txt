(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (S.I. 1987/1967) to allow certain persons more time for claiming a Sure Start Maternity Grant (“SSMG”). The persons concerned are those who have been given leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom having left—
Afghanistan in connection with the fall of the Afghan Government; and
Ukraine following the Russian invasion of that country,
who have an existing member of their family aged under 16 at the date of claim. Regulation 3(3) makes a related amendment to the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations 2005 (S.I. 2005/3061) (“the 2005 Regulations”) to enable such persons to claim an SSMG where there is an existing family member who is under the age of 16.
Regulation 3(2) amends the 2005 Regulations to remove the requirement that a person must have obtained the advice of a healthcare professional before claiming an SSMG.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement amendments to Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973, as amended by the Protocols of 1978 and 1997 (known as MARPOL). Annex VI of MARPOL contains rules on air pollution from ships, and the amendments implemented by this instrument concern measures relating to energy efficiency and carbon intensity of ships. The amendments are set out in resolution MEPC.328(76) of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (“MEPC”) of the International Maritime Organisation (“IMO”).

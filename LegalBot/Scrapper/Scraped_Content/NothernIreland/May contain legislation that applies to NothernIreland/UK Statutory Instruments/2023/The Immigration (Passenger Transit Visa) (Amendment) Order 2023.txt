(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Immigration (Passenger Transit Visa) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/2702) which requires certain passengers to hold a transit visa to pass through the United Kingdom without entering whilst transiting to another country.
Schedule 1 to that Order sets out a list of countries or territories whose nationals or citizens need transit visas, and this Order adds Dominica, Honduras, Namibia, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu to that list.
Article 3 of this Order contains a transitional provision to disapply the requirement for a transit visa to people who at the time this Order comes into force had already booked travel to the United Kingdom to arrive on or before 16th August 2023 and arrived on or before that date.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector or community bodies is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations apply (with modifications) public health, marketing and organic products standards applicable in Great Britain to consignments of retail agri-food goods in Northern Ireland which have moved from Great Britain under the Northern Ireland Retail Movement Scheme to the extent that EU public health, marketing and organic products standards (which would otherwise apply in Northern Ireland) are disapplied in accordance with the Windsor Framework. They also make amendments to retained direct EU legislation and the Official Controls (Plant Health) (Frequency of Checks) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/739) for the purpose of implementing the Windsor Framework(1).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations (EUR 2005/1) and make provision for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (EUR 2017/625).
Regulation 2 substitutes, in relation to Wales, a new Annex 2 to Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 which relates to the preparation and completion of journey logs required under Article 5(4) of that Regulation for certain journeys involving the transportation of animals.
Regulation 3 specifies, in relation to Wales, the date on which the transitional measures in Article 154(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 come to an end. As of 6 April 2023, Article 21 of that Regulation will apply in full in place of the corresponding provisions in Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005.
Regulation 4 makes consequential amendments to the Welfare of Animals (Transport) (Wales) Order 2007 (S.I. 2007/1047 (W. 105)).
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations.

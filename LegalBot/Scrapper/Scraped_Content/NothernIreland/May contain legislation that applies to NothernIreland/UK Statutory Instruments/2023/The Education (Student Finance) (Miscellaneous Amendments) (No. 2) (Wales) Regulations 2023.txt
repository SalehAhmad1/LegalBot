12 June 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend various Regulations which make provision about, and in connection with, student finance.
Amendments are made—
(a)
to the name that certain British overseas territories are now known by to be consistent with the British Nationality Act 1981, and
(b)
that relate to the immigration status of certain Afghan citizens as a result of changes made to the immigration rules.
Amendments are also made to the Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2017 and the Education (Student Support) (Wales) Regulations 2018 to disapply early termination of eligibility for certain categories of eligible students in circumstances where a person has become a British or Irish citizen.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Higher Education Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.

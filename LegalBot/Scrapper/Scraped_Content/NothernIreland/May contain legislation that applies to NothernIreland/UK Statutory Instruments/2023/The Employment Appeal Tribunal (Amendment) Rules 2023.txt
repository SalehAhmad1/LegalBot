Ministry of JusticeEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
The Employment Appeal Tribunal Rules 1993 (“the 1993 Rules”) are the rules governing the procedure in the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT).
Rule 2(2) amends rule 3 (institution of appeal) of the 1993 Rules to reduce the number of documents that are required to be submitted with the Notice of Appeal in order for an appeal to be properly instituted in the EAT.
Rule 2(3) amends rule 37 (time) to make further provision for the EAT to extend the time limit for the submission of an appeal. This discretion applies where an error was made in lodging the required documents under rule 3(1) but this has been rectified, and the EAT considers that the nature of the error is minor, and having regard to all the circumstances including any prejudice to any respondent that it remains in the interests of justice to grant an extension of time.
Rule 2(4) amends the Schedule to the 1993 Rules to insert a statement to each of the EAT forms as a reminder to any appellant, applicant or respondent to proceedings in the EAT, that it is necessary to read and comply with the provisions of any relevant practice direction at each stage of the proceedings, and further of the need to comply with the overriding objective and to ensure communication with the Appeal Tribunal and other parties to the proceedings is respectful and appropriate.
Rule 2(4) also makes minor amendments to each of the EAT forms to clarify the contact information that should be provided to the EAT where available. It also makes amendments to Form 1 to better reflect the requirements for the submission of documents to the EAT under rule 3(1), updates references to the reconsideration procedure in the employment tribunal, and makes further amendments to Form 5A to remove an obsolete legislative reference.
No impact assessment has been carried out for these amendments as no, or no significant impact, on the private, voluntary, or public sectors is foreseen.

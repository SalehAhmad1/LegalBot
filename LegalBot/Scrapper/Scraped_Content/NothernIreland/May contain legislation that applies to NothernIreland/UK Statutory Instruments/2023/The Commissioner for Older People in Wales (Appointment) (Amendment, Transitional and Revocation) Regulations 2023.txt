1 November 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under powers given to the National Assembly for Wales, now vested in the Welsh Ministers, by the Commissioner for Older People (Wales) Act 2006 (c. 30) (“the Act”). The Act establishes the office of the Commissioner for Older People in Wales (“the Commissioner”).
The Commissioner for Older People in Wales (Appointment) Regulations 2007 (“the 2007 Regulations”) (as amended by the Commissioner for Older People in Wales (Appointment) (Amendment) Regulations 2016) make provision in relation to the appointment of the Commissioner.
The 2007 Regulations specify the Commissioner’s term of office. These Regulations amend that term to ensure that the Commissioner’s term of office is in line with the respective terms of office for which the Children’s Commissioner for Wales, the Future Generations Commissioner and Welsh Language Commissioner are appointed.
Regulation 3 amends the term of office for which the Commissioner must be appointed from a period of four to seven years, and provides that the Commissioner may only be appointed for a single term of office.
Regulation 4 removes the power to extend the Commissioner’s term of office for a period of two years.
Regulation 5 makes transitional arrangements in respect of these amendments.
Regulation 6 revokes the Commissioner for Older People in Wales (Appointment) (Amendment) Regulations 2016.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

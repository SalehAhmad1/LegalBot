(This note is not part of the Order)
The withdrawal of the UK from the EU created a need to establish new border control arrangements and checks on imports. This Order grants planning permission for a border control post and parking for up to 60 heavy goods vehicles at Plot 9, Parc Cybi, Holyhead.
Article 3 grants planning permission for development consisting of the use of land for the processing and stationing of vehicles entering or leaving Great Britain at the Port of Holyhead, and the provision of associated facilities and infrastructure.
Article 4 prohibits any development within a rocky outcrop.
Article 5 and the Schedule specify the conditions for the development of the site. The matters in Part 2 of the Schedule must be operational before the site is brought into use.
Article 6 provides the process for obtaining a relevant approval from the local planning authority. A relevant approval is required by the conditions in Part 2 for a signage strategy, for a landscape maintenance plan, in relation to noise mitigation measures and to use different colour finishes to those specified. A relevant approval is required by the conditions in Part 3 for a revised travel plan and for any noise study which is required for specified new activity on the site.
Broadly, the conditions cover construction hours, noise and vibration (including limits and mitigation measures), lighting, protection against invasive non-native species of plants and animals, building height and hard surfacing, the rocky outcrop, fencing, visual impacts, access, landscaping, waste management and drainage, traffic management and travel.

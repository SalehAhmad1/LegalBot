(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 2 of these Regulations amends the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/330) which set fees for the exercise of various functions in connection with immigration and nationality.
Regulation 4(2) creates a fee for applications made under Appendix Gurkha and Hong Kong military unit veteran discharged before 1 July 1997 to the immigration rules and regulation 5 creates a fee for applications for an Electronic Travel Authorisation.
Regulation 4(3)(a) reflects the application of Appendix Family Reunion (Protection) to the immigration rules.
Regulation 4(3)(b) removes a fee which is no longer necessary.
Regulations 2, 6(2) and 7 to 9 reflect changes to fees in respect of applications made under the priority services.
Regulation 6(3) enables the application of the fee for expedited entry of a passenger into, or transiting of a passenger through, the United Kingdom using the Border Force fast track service at all terminals at Heathrow airport.
Regulation 10 and Schedule 1 increase fees payable for applications. Regulation 11 and Schedule 2 increase the amount of deductions from fees in respect of Health and Care visa applications.
Part 3 (regulation 12) makes transitional provision. In particular, it enables fees payable for child citizenship applications which are made following unsuccessful waiver applications not to take account of the increases made by these Regulations.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs to business has been produced. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

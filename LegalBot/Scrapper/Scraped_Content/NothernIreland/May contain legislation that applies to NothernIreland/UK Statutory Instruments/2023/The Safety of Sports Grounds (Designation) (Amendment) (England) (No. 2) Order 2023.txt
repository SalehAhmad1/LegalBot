(This note is not part of the Order)
Under section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (c. 52) (“the Act”), where the Secretary of State is of the opinion that a sports ground has accommodation for more than the specified number of spectators, the Secretary of State may by order designate that sports ground as a sports ground requiring a safety certificate under the Act.
This Order amends the Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/661) to reflect the changed name of Brentford Football Club’s home ground, and to designate Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as a sports ground for which a safety certificate is required under the Act (in substitution for the existing entry for White Hart Lane).
Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is occupied by Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, a member of the Football Association Premier League Limited, and is a sports ground in England at which association football matches are played and which, in the Secretary of State’s opinion, has accommodation for more than 5,000 spectators.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

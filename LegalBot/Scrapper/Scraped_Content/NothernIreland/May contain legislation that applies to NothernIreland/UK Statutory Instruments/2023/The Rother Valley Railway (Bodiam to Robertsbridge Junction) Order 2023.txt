(4) Sub-paragraph (3) does not apply in the case of the removal of a public sewer but where such a sewer is removed in pursuance of such a notice or order as is mentioned in that sub-paragraph, any person who is—
(a)
the owner or occupier of premises the drains of which communicated with that sewer; or
(b)
the owner of a private sewer which communicated with that sewer,
is entitled to recover from the Company compensation in respect of expenditure reasonably incurred by that person, in consequence of the removal, for the purpose of making the drain or sewer belonging to that person communicate with any other public sewer or with a private sewerage disposal plant.
(5) The provisions of the 1990 Act mentioned in sub-paragraph (1), as applied by that sub-paragraph, do not have effect in relation to apparatus as respects which paragraph 2, or Part 3 of the 1991 Act, applies.

4.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the Company and the undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Acquisition of apparatus
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the Order plans, the Company must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Alternative apparatus
6.—(1) If in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the Company acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of an undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in question.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the Company requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the Company must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the Company and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the Company, or the Company is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the Company, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the Company under this Part of this Schedule is to be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the undertaker in question and the Company or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(5) The undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration), and after the grant to the undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the Company to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the Company gives notice in writing to the undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the Company, that work, instead of being executed by the undertaker, must be executed by the Company without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the Company to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the Company affords to an undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the Company of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the Company and the undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of the Company, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of the Company for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of the Company or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the Company in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the Company to that undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Existing apparatus: protection and access
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works of the type referred to in paragraph 6(2) that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the Company under paragraph 6(2), the Company must submit to the undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by an undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If an undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the Company, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the Company of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the Company under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the Company from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The Company is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the Company must repay to an undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the Company or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Damage to apparatus: costs, losses, etc.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of an undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any undertaker, the Company must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the Company with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of an undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) An undertaker must give the Company reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the Company which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Enactments and agreements
11.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the Company and an undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the Company on the date on which this Order is made.

the failure of any such work,
damage to the fishery is caused, or the Agency has reason to expect that such damage may be caused, the Agency may serve notice on the Company requiring it to take such steps as may be reasonably practicable to make good the damage, or, as the case may be, to protect the fishery against such damage.
(3) Subject to paragraph 23, if within such time as may be reasonably practicable for that purpose after the receipt of written notice from the Agency of any damage or expected damage to a fishery, the Company fails to take such steps as are described in sub-paragraph (2), the Agency may take those steps and may recover from the Company the expense reasonably incurred by it in doing so.

(2) The drainage authority must give to the Company reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise may be made without the agreement of the Company which agreement must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
26.  The fact that any work or thing has been executed or done by the Company in accordance with plans approved by the drainage authority, or to the drainage authority’s satisfaction, or in accordance with any directions or award of an arbitrator, does not relieve the Company from any liability under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
27.  Any difference arising between the Company and the drainage authority under this Part of this Schedule (other than a difference as to the meaning or construction of this Part of this Schedule) is to be referred to and settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).

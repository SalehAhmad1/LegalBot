Legislative Framework
11.  The 2011 Act establishes PCCs within each force area in England and Wales with the exception of the City of London.

It further requires them to hold the force Chief Constable to account for the operational delivery of policing including in relation to the Strategic Policing Requirement published by the Home Secretary.
Commencement Information
I11
Sch. para. 11 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
12.  The 2011 Act does not impinge on the common law legal authority of the office of constable, or the duty of constables to maintain the King’s Peace without fear or favour. It is the will of Parliament and Government that the office of constable shall not be open to improper political interference.

I12
Sch. para. 12 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
13.  Each PCC and their respective Chief Constable are established in law as corporations sole within the 2011 Act.

Chief Constables are charged with the impartial direction and control of all constables and staff within the police force that they lead. The staff of the PCC are accountable to the directly elected holder of that office to enable the PCC to exercise their functions.

I26
Sch. para. 26 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
The Home Secretary
27.  The establishment of PCCs has given the police greater freedom to meet local priorities and enabled the public to hold the police to account. The Home Secretary, as the person responsible to Parliament for cutting crime, protecting the public and protecting our national borders and security, has an important role in working with PCCs and Chief Constables to ensure the policing system works effectively.
Commencement Information
I27

28.  The Home Secretary is ultimately accountable to Parliament and charged with ensuring the maintenance of the King’s Peace within all force areas, safeguarding the public and protecting our national borders and security. The Home Secretary has reserved powers and legislative tools that enable intervention and direction to all parties. These powers may be used, in line with statutory tests and public law principles, in exceptional circumstances when it is determined by the Home Secretary that such action is necessary in order to prevent or mitigate risk to the public or national security. Such powers and tools will not be used to interfere with the democratic mandate of the PCC within a force area, nor seek to interfere with the office of constable or operational independence more generally, unless the Home Secretary is satisfied on the advice of HMICFRS that not to do so would result in a police force failing or national security being compromised.
Commencement Information
I28
Sch. para. 28 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)

Commencement Information
I29
Sch. para. 29 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
30.  The Home Secretary retains the legal accountability for national security and the role that the police service plays within the delivery of any national response. The Home Secretary has a duty to issue a Strategic Policing Requirement that sets out what are, in their view, the national threats at the time and the appropriate national policing capabilities that are required to counter them. PCCs and Chief Constables must have regard to the Strategic Policing Requirement and PCCs should take into account national policy when delivering their police and crime plans.
Commencement Information
I30
Sch. para. 30 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
31.  In order to ensure that the Home Secretary is equipped with the information required to respond to the public and Parliament, PCCs and Chief Constables should expect the Home Secretary to ask for information about matters pertinent to policing, without compromising the principles of operational independence or local accountability and in accordance with the Home Secretary’s statutory powers.
Commencement Information
I31
Sch. para. 31 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
Operational Matters
32.  The operational independence of the police is a fundamental principle of British policing. It is expected by the Home Secretary that the professional discretion of the police service and oath of office give surety to the public that this shall not be compromised.
Commencement Information
I32
Sch. para. 32 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
33.  The current arrangements are defined in part by the 2011 Act.
Commencement Information
I33
Sch. para. 33 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
34.  Section 2 of the 2011 Act provides that a police force, and the civilian staff of a police force, are under the direction and control of the Chief Constable of the force. Section 4 makes identical provision for the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.

I34
Sch. para. 34 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)

Commencement Information
I35
Sch. para. 35 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
36.  This list is not exhaustive and is by way of illustration only. The Chief Constable is expected to ensure that their PCC is regularly informed of their decisions and operational activity in a timely manner so that the PCC can hold the Chief Constable to account for the totality of policing within their force area, including the operational delivery of the police service. The direction and control of the Chief Constable does not just remain under the scrutiny of the PCC but is open to investigation and scrutiny by the IOPC within the parameters of their terms of reference.
Commencement Information
I36
Sch. para. 36 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
37.  The PCC and Chief Constable must work together to safeguard the principle of operational independence, while ensuring that the PCC is not fettered in fulfilling their statutory role. The concept of operational independence is not defined in statute, and as HMICFRS has stated, by its nature, is fluid and context-driven.
Commencement Information
I37
Sch. para. 37 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
38.  The relationship between the PCC and Chief Constable is defined by the PCC’s democratic mandate to hold the Chief Constable to account, and by the law itself: primary legislation and common law already provide clarity on the legal principles that underpin operational independence and the Office of Constable.
Commencement Information
I38
Sch. para. 38 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
39.  In order to respond to the strategic objectives set by the PCC and the wide variety of challenges faced by the police every day, the Chief Constable is charged with the direction and control of the Force and day-to-day management of such force assets as agreed by the PCC.
Commencement Information
I39
Sch. para. 39 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)
40.  This Protocol does not fetter the ability of the IOPC to issue separate guidance on the distinct meaning of ‘direction and control’ as it is used in Part 2 of the Police Reform Act 2002(5)in the context of police complaints.

I40
Sch. para. 40 in force at 3.7.2023, see art. 1(1)

Resolving differences
44.  The PCC is a publicly accountable individual who together with their Chief Constable will need to establish effective working relationships in order to deliver policing within England and Wales.

(This note is not part of the Order)
Section 79 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 (c. 13) requires the Secretary of State to issue a Policing Protocol. This Order replaces the Policing Protocol, issued under the Policing Protocol Order 2011 (S.I. 2011/2744), which it revokes, with the Policing Protocol 2023.
The Policing Protocol makes provision about the ways in which relevant persons should exercise or refrain from exercising functions so as to encourage, maintain or improve working relationships or limit or prevent the overlapping or conflicting exercise of functions. “Relevant persons” for these purposes are the Secretary of State (in the exercise of policing functions), elected local policing bodies (namely police and crime commissioners, including Combined Authority Mayors exercising police and crime commissioner functions, and the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime), chief officers of police forces maintained by elected local policing bodies, and police and crime panels. These persons must have regard to the Policing Protocol in exercising their functions.
The Policing Protocol 2023 updates and revises the Policing Protocol.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector or community bodies is foreseen.

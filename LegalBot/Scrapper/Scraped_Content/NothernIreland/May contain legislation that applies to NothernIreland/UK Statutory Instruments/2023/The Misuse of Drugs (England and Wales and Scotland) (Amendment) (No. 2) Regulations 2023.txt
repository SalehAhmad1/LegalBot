These Regulations amend the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 in England and Wales and Scotland.
The effect of the amendments is to permit independent prescribing of controlled drugs by therapeutic radiographer independent prescribers and paramedic independent prescribers. They also permit the supply of codeine products by podiatrists and make technical amendments in respect of podiatrist independent prescribers and physiotherapist independent prescribers, and as regards possession of ketamine by healthcare professionals.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and community bodies is available from www.legislation.gov.uk and published with an Explanatory Memorandum alongside the instrument.

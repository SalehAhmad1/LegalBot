Deputy Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Arrangements for defence and security co-operation in place between the United Kingdom and Kosovo have resulted in increasingly close defence co-operation, and Kosovo joining UK led exercises and activities.
The development of the defence relationships with Kosovo means that the arrangements now require reciprocal concurrent jurisdictional provision. In order to support that requirement, it is necessary to designate Kosovo as a country to which the Visiting Forces Act 1952 applies.

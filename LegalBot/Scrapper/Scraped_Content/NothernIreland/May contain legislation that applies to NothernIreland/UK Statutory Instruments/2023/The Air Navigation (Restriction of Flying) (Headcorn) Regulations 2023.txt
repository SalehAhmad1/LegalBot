EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Headcorn/Lashenden

scheduled to take place there on 30th June 2023, 1st July 2023, and 2nd July 2023 (inclusive). 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the

The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST).

display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular

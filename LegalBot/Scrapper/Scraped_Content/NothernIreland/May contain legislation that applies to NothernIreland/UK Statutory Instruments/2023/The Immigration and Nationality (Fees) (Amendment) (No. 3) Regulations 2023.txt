(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/330) which set fees for the exercise of various functions in connection with immigration and nationality.
Regulation 3 provides, by amendment, for a fee for victims of domestic abuse who wish to apply from overseas for indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom. This is a fee for a new application which was not previously available. It also provides for waivers of those fees where the applicant satisfies a destitution test.
Regulation 4 amends entry 9.3 in Schedule 2 to reflect the new Appendix Victim of Domestic Abuse to the immigration rules. It also amends entry 9.8 to reflect the new Appendix Statelessness, and further provides a fee exception for Part 14 applications under the immigration rules.
A full impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

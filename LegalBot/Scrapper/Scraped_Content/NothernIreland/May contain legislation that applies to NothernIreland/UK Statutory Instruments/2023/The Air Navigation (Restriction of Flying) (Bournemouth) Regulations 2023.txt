displays and associated rehearsals that are due to take place there from 30th August to 3rd 
September 2023 (inclusive). 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and rehearsals and

behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(3), the Bournemouth Air Festival flying 
display director may be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Notice to Aviation (NOTAM).

Regulation 2(2) amends the fee payable in a case where a special measures direction provides for a video recording to be admitted under section 28 (video recorded cross-examination or re-examination) of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 (c. 23) (the “1999 Act”). It amends the fee in respect of all cross-examination, including re-examination, which is recorded by means of video recording and where such a recording is admissible by virtue of a special measures direction, from £670 per case to £1000 per case. For this purpose, “special measures direction” has the meaning given in section 33(1)(interpretation etc.) of the 1999 Act.

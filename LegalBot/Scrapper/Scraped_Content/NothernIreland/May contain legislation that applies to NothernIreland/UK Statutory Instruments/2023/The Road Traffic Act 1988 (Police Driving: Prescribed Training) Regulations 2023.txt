(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations prescribe training for the purposes of sections 2A and 3ZA of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (c. 52).
These Regulations revoke the Road Traffic Act 1988 (Police Driving: Prescribed Training) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1112). These Regulations are materially the same as the Regulations revoked, except technical changes have been made. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 (c. 32) amended sections 2A and 3ZA of the Road Traffic Act 1988 to make provision as to the meaning of dangerous driving and careless driving in respect of police driving. Those standards for police driving refer to the driver having undertaken “prescribed training”. Regulation 3 sets out when a training course provided in England and Wales only will be prescribed training. Regulation 4 makes provision for refresher training to be undertaken for a training course provided in England and Wales following the end of the validity period for that course. Regulation 5 sets out when a training course provided in Scotland only will be prescribed training. Regulation 6 makes provision for refresher training to be undertaken for a training course provided in Scotland following the end of the validity period for that course. Regulation 7 makes provision for training completed prior to the commencement of the Regulations revoked to be prescribed training.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector or community bodies is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Care and Support (Charging and Assessment of Resources) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/2672) (“the 2014 Regulations”). Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations lists categories of capital that must be disregarded by local authorities when calculating someone’s assets for charging purposes. Regulation 2 inserts a new paragraph 43 into Schedule 2.
The Social Security (Additional Payments) Act 2023 (“the Act”) makes provision about additional payments to recipients of means-tested benefits, tax credits and disability benefits. The new paragraph 43 of Schedule 2 to the 2014 Regulations provides that payments made to an adult which would be disregarded under section 8 of the Act are to be disregarded in the calculation of the adult’s capital for the purpose of an assessment of that adult’s financial resources.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

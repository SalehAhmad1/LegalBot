2.  In these Regulations—
“the 2011 Regulations” means the Seed Marketing Regulations 2011(1);
“the applicant” means a person applying for a licence in accordance with regulation 5;
“the experiment” means the temporary experiment organised in accordance with these Regulations and complying with the purpose specified in regulation 21A of the 2011 Regulations(2);
“heterogeneous material” means a plant grouping within a single botanical taxon of the lowest known rank which presents common phenotypic characteristics and has been developed by crossing multiple varieties of a plant species, with the resulting plants being genetically diverse and having varied characteristics;
“lot” means one or more units of a single commodity, identifiable by its homogeneity of composition and origin, which form part of a consignment;
“low-input agriculture” means systems of crop production managed with reduced use of external inputs, such as fertilisers and fuel, resulting in a more sustainable agricultural system;
“marketing” has the meaning given by regulation 2 of the 2011 Regulations;
“participant” means a person granted a licence to participate in the experiment referred to in regulation 3;
“population” means heterogeneous material which, as a grouping, is—
(a)
identifiable on the bases set out in regulation 13(1), but insufficiently uniform to be a variety,
(b)
characterised by a high level of genetic and phenotypic diversity between individual reproductive units, so that the plant grouping is represented by the material as a whole and not by a small number of plants, and
(c)
not a mixture of varieties;
“variety” has the meaning given by section 1(3) of the Plant Varieties Act 1997(3).

See regulation 21(1) of the 2011 Regulations, which deals with licensing of seed samplers.Quantitative restrictions
18.—(1) The Secretary of State must set a maximum quantity of seed from all populations produced under the experiment that may be marketed during the period that the experiment remains in force.
(2) In setting the maximum quantity, the Secretary of State must consider—
(a)
the need to test different types of population;
(b)
the need to ensure that the quantity is sufficient to produce reliable and representative results; and
(c)
the need to prevent the development of a market parallel to that in seed which meets the requirements of the 2011 Regulations.
(3) A participant must, in each year of participation in the experiment, on or before a date specified in the participant’s licence, declare to the Secretary of State the quantity of seed produced under the experiment which the participant intends to market in the following calendar year.
(4) The participant must make a separate declaration under paragraph (3) in respect of each population under the participant’s control in respect of which the participant is licensed.
(5) The Secretary of State may from time to time consider whether it is desirable to adjust the maximum quantity referred to in paragraph (1), having regard to—

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations apply in relation to seed produced in England under a temporary experiment, the purpose of which is to seek alternatives, which may be more suitable for use under particular conditions, to seed of cereal species which conform to varietal requirements. The experiment is to run for a period of 7 years beginning with the date that these Regulations come into force. Licences issued under regulation 21A of the Seed Marketing Regulations 2011 (“the 2011 Regulations”) (S.I. 2011/463) exempt participants in the experiment from compliance with specified provisions of the 2011 Regulations. Regulation 21A of those Regulations permits this where the experiment is organised in accordance with regulations made under section 16(5) of the Plant Varieties and Seeds Act 1964 (c. 14) (“the 1964 Act”). These Regulations allow the production and marketing of limited quantities of heterogeneous material (seed with diverse genetic characteristics derived from several varieties and produced through repeated sowings).
Regulations 3 to 7 deal with the purpose of the temporary experiment, the licensing procedure and the effect of the grant of a licence. Regulation 4 of, and Schedule 1 to, these Regulations list the species which may be included in the experiment. Regulation 7 and Schedule 2 make transitory modifications to the 2011 Regulations to enable seed produced under the experiment to be certified and marketed on the basis of meeting the requirements in the 2011 Regulations, as so modified. The modifications include those made by paragraph 12 of Schedule 2, which provides for existing appeal rights under the 2011 Regulations to apply in relation to a refusal to grant a licence to participate in the experiment, a variation of conditions attached to the licence, and a decision to suspend or revoke the licence.
Regulations 8 and 9 permit the Secretary of State to vary, suspend or revoke a licence granted under regulation 21A of the 2011 Regulations in certain circumstances. Regulations 10 and 11 specify participants’ reporting and recording obligations and a requirement to provide the Secretary of State with access to premises and records for the purpose of inspections.
Part 3 of these Regulations deals with certification and marketing of heterogeneous material, including certification standards and requirements in relation to labelling, traceability and maintenance.
Regulation 18 requires the Secretary of State to set a maximum quantity of seed to be produced under the experiment. It also permits changes to be made to the maximum quantity which may be produced by a participant during the course of the experiment. Regulation 19 requires the Secretary of State to carry out official controls on heterogeneous material produced under the experiment.
Under section 16(7) of the 1964 Act, breach of any provision of the Regulations, or the inclusion in a statutory statement of anything which is false in a material particular, is an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale.

These Regulations amend Regulation (EC) No. 2195/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5th November 2002 on the Common Procurement Vocabulary (CPV) by changing references to “handicapped” in the Regulation to “disabled”, as the current wording in the UK’s Common Procurement Vocabulary codes is not in line with the language of the Equality Act 2010.

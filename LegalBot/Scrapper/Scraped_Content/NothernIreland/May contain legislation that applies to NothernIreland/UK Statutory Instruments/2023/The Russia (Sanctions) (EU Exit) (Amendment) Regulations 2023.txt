18th April 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) to amend the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855) (“the 2019 Regulations”).
Regulations 3 to 8 amend Part 5 (which makes provision in respect of trade) of the 2019 Regulations.
Regulation 3 specifically inserts a new Chapter 4CA which makes specific provision prohibiting the importation of iron and steel products, containing iron or steel originating in Russia, that have been processed in a third-country.
Regulation 4 amends Chapter 4G which makes provision for revenue generating goods. In doing so, it recasts the former Schedule 3D, and makes consequential amendments to regulations 46R to 46X.
Regulation 5 inserts a new Chapter 4GA which also makes provision in respect of revenue generating goods and introduces a new Schedule 3DA which specifies certain revenue generating goods. No good appears in both Schedule 3D and Schedule 3DA.
Regulation 6 makes remedial amendments to Chapter 4I which relates to oil and oil products. Regulations 7 and 8 make similar provision in relation to gold (Chapter 4J) and coal and coal products (Chapter 4K) respectively.
Regulation 9, 10 and 11 amend Part 7 (which makes provision for exceptions and licences) of the 2019 Regulations. The amendments include provision relating to the acquisition of otherwise prohibited goods for the purpose of the function of a United Kingdom diplomatic mission in Russia, and the acquisition of certain goods by United Kingdom nationals situated in Russia for use in Russia.
Regulations 12 and 13 make provision in relation to enforcement of the 2019 Regulations.
The remainder of the Regulations amend certain Schedules to the 2019 Regulations, some of which changes are remedial, whilst others, such as the insertion of Schedule 3DA, are entirely new.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector has been published alongside these Regulations and is available from legislation.gov.uk or from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, King Charles Street, London SW1A 2AH.

SCHEDULE
Pitch fee review form
                    EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations prescribe the form of document that must accompany a pitch fee review notice (served under paragraph 17(2) or (6)(b) of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Mobile Homes Act 1983) which proposes an increase in the pitch fee. The document must be in the form prescribed in the Schedule to these Regulations or in a form substantially to the like effect. A pitch fee review notice which proposes an increase in the pitch fee is of no effect unless it is accompanied by such a document.
The document, to be completed by the site owner, provides occupiers with information about how the proposed new pitch fee has been calculated and information about the pitch fee review process.
The effect of these Regulations is to replace the previous prescribed pitch fee review form (prescribed by the Mobile Homes (Pitch Fees) (Prescribed Form) (England) Regulations 2013 (“the 2013 Regulations”)) with a new form in which references to the pitch fee review inflationary index are changed from the Retail Prices Index (RPI) to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). This reflects changes made by the Mobile Homes (Pitch Fees) Act 2023 (c.11). Regulation 3 of these Regulations revokes the 2013 Regulations.
No impact assessment has been prepared for this instrument as the changes being made to the form have no impact on the statutory process for reviewing pitch fees and therefore no significant impact on businesses, the voluntary or public sectors.

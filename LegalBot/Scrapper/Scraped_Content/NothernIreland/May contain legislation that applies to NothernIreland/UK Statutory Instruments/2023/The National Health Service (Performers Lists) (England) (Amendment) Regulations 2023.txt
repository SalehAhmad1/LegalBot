At 12.30 p.m. on 10th May 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Performers Lists) (England) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/335) (“the 2013 Regulations”).
Regulation 3 inserts a new regulation 5A into the 2013 Regulations to provide that where a practitioner makes an application for inclusion in a performers list in England and is already included in an equivalent list in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, the practitioner must be included on the relevant performers list in England on a provisional basis, until the Board notifies the practitioner of its decision or a period of three months elapses, whichever is sooner.
Regulation 6 amends regulation 34 of the 2013 Regulations to revoke the exemptions from the requirement to undertake foundation training which apply to dental practitioners with qualifications from an EU member state, with experience in community dental service or the armed forces, or who are assessed by a post-graduate dental dean or director of postgraduate dental education to have the necessary knowledge or experience. Regulation 34(4) is amended to provide two exemptions in their place. The first is where a dental practitioner is judged, through an assessment by the Board, to have knowledge and experience equivalent to that of a dental practitioner who has satisfactorily completed foundation training. The second is where a dental practitioner is participating in an induction programme specified by the Board.
Regulations 4, 5, and 7 make minor amendments related to the amendments made by regulations 3 and 6.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

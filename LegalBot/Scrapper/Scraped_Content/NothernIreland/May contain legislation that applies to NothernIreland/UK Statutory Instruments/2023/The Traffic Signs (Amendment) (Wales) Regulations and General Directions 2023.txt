7 July 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Instrument)
This Instrument amends the Traffic Signs Regulations 2016 and the Traffic Signs General Directions 2016, together cited as the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 (“the 2016 Instrument”). These amendments are only relevant to Wales and are consequential on and supplementary to the Restricted Roads (20 mph Speed Limit) (Wales) Order 2022, which reduces the general speed limit for restricted roads from 30 mph to 20 mph in Wales from 17 September 2023. A reference in this note to a Schedule is to a Schedule to the 2016 Instrument.
Regulation 3 enables a new road safety plate to be used in addition to the signs which warn of children going to or from school or playground ahead, or of road humps. It also enables a sign for road humps to be accompanied by a plate warning of a traffic calmed area.
Regulation 4 amends the application of the signs used to notify of the entrance to and exit from a 20 mph zone so that they can no longer be used in Wales. As a consequence of the general speed limit for restricted roads being reduced from 30 mph to 20 mph in Wales, 20 mph zones will no longer be necessary and will therefore be abolished.
Regulation 5 enables two new signs to be used. One sign will be used to warn of the end of a traffic calmed area and the other to warn of a speed camera ahead and remind drivers of the 20 mph speed limit. The corresponding sign reminding drivers of the 30 mph speed limit will no longer apply to Wales to reflect the reduction in the general speed limit for restricted roads.
Regulation 6 enables a new sign to be used to warn of or indicate the commencement of a new 20 mph speed limit. The corresponding sign indicating the commencement point of a new 30 mph speed limit will no longer apply to Wales to reflect the reduction in the general speed limit for restricted roads.
Regulation 9 prohibits the use of repeater signs on roads subject to a maximum speed limit of 20 mph and which have a system of carriageway lighting.
Regulation 10 restricts the use of the new sign introduced in regulation 6 warning of or indicating the commencement of a new 20 mph speed limit. The sign can only be used on a road with a recently imposed speed limit of 20 mph during the period of 12 months beginning with the day on which the new 20 mph speed limit comes into force.
Regulation 11 is a transitional and savings provision which applies to the 2016 Instrument. Signs which were in place prior to the coming into force of this Instrument and which complied with the 2016 Instrument as in force before the amendments made by this Instrument are to be treated as continuing to comply with the 2016 Instrument. The transitional and savings provision will cease to have effect after 12 months, save for in relation to the road marking indicating the maximum speed limit which will cease to have effect after 5 years. The transitional and savings provision will not apply to the sign warning of a speed camera ahead on a lit road and reminding drivers of a 30 mph speed limit.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to this Instrument. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with this Instrument.

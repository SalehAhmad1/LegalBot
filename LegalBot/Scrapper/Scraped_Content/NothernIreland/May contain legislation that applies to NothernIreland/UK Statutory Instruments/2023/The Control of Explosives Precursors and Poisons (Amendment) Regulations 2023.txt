(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are being issued free of charge in order to make corrections to regulation 8 (“regulation 8”) of the Control of Explosives Precursors and Poisons Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/63) (“the Principal Regulations”).
Regulation 8 makes amendments to Schedule 1A to the Poisons Act 1972 (c. 66). Regulation 2 of these Regulations substitutes a new regulation 8 to include Chemical Abstracts Service Registry numbers for certain substances, and to make separate provision for Zinc phosphide and Calcium phosphide.
A full impact assessment of the effect that the Principal Regulations (including regulation 8) will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector was undertaken. A copy is annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Principal Regulations, which is available on www.legislation.gov.uk. Copies may also be obtained by writing to the Explosives Precursors and Poisons team at the Home Office, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF (or by sending an e-mail to precursorsandpoisons@homeoffice.gov.uk).

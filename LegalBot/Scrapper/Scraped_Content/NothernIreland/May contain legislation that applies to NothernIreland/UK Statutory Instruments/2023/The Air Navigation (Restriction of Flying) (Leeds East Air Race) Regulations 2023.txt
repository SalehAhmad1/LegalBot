EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Leeds East Aerodrome during 
air races that are scheduled to take place there on 24th June 2023 and 25th June 2023. 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the races and therefore the Civil 
Aviation Authority and Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in the 
vicinity of the event for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permissions mentioned in regulation 3(2), the Leeds East Aerodrome air-ground 
service and the Royal Aero Club Records, Racing and Rally Association Clerk of the Course can 
be contacted as notified. 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) and Notice to Aviation (NOTAM).

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order revokes the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) (Isle of Man) Order 2021 (S.I. 2021/1257) (“the 2021 Order”). That Order extended to the Isle of Man, with modifications, the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/600) as amended from time to time.
In consequence of legislation now made by the Isle of Man to the same effect, the 2021 Order is now redundant and is therefore revoked.

26th January 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations bring into force on the 27th February 2023 the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Minimum Age) Act 2022 (c. 28).
Part 2 of these Regulations makes transitional provision to void marriage and civil partnership schedules, which have been issued before these Regulations come into force, where either party will remain under the age of the 18 throughout the validity period of these schedules. Provision is also made to clarify that where marriage and civil partnership schedules have been issued before these Regulations come into force, and both parties will be aged 18 during the period of validity of the schedules, the schedules may not be used until both parties have turned 18. Equivalent provision is made for marriages solemnized, and civil partnerships registered, on the authority of a Registrar General’s licence. Replicating provision is made for notices to register as civil partners under the Civil Partnership (Armed Forces) Order 2005 (S.I. 2005/3188), the Civil Partnership (Registration Abroad and Certificates) Order 2005 (S.I. 2005/2761) and the Consular Marriages and Marriages under Foreign Law (No. 2) Order 2014 (S.I. 2016/3265).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

29 January 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989 (S.I. 1989/306) (“the Principal Regulations”), which provide for the making and recovery of charges for relevant services provided under the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 (c. 42) to overseas visitors.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 4D of the Principal Regulations, which is concerned with charges for the provision of healthcare services to individuals who have made a late application for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom under the European Union Settlement Scheme (“EUSS”). The amendments provide that individuals who have made such an application, but have not been granted EUSS pre-settled or settled status, must not be charged for relevant healthcare services provided to them whilst their application is under consideration, and that any charges for such services—
if already made, must not be recovered,
if already paid, must be repaid.
The Welsh Ministers’ code of practice on the carrying out of regulatory impact assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

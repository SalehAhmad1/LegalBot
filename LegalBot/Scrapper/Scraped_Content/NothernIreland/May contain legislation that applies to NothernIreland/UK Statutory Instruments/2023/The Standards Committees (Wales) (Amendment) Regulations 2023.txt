11 September 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations add corporate joint committees established by regulations made under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 to the definition of “relevant authority” in the Standards Committees (Wales) Regulations 2001 (“the 2001 Regulations”).
These Regulations also amend the 2001 Regulations to provide for the size, composition, and proceedings of standards committees of corporate joint committees and correct errors in the Welsh language text.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to the regulations which establish corporate joint committees and connected regulations and orders. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment was prepared at the time of making those establishment regulations and is relied on for the purpose of these Regulations.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in locations and airspace specified in the Schedule 
during flying displays by jet formation teams such as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the 
Red Arrows, which are due to take place during the period from 12th August 2023 to 17th 
September 2023 (inclusive). 
Many aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the displays and therefore the 
Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that flying should be restricted in 
the vicinity of the events for reasons of public safety. 
The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST). 
In relation to the permission mentioned in regulation 3(2)(b), the flying display director may be 
contacted on a telephone number which will be notified by Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
Full details of this Statutory Instrument will be promulgated by Aeronautical Information Circular 
(AIC) Notice to Aviation (NOTAM). 
The point of contact in the Civil Aviation Authority is Mr S J Maxted, Airspace Regulator, Safety 
and Airspace Regulation Group, on telephone number 03301 383216.

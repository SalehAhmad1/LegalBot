1991 c. 65; section 3 was amended by section 106 of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 (c. 12).EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations enable penalty notices to be issued as a means of enforcing certain criminal offences relating to animal health and welfare. They provide that the offences in question are “relevant offences” or “specified dangerous dogs offences” for the purpose of the Animals (Penalty Notices) Act 2022 (“the Act”), and specify the authorities who may issue penalty notices.
Regulation 3 provides that offences listed in the first column table in Schedule 1 are “relevant offences” for the purpose of section 1(2) of the Act, with the consequence that penalty notices can be issued as a means of enforcing those offences, where the offences are in force. It provides that the persons listed in the second column of the table are enforcement authorities for the purpose of section 1(4) of the Act (and so have the power to issue penalty notices for the corresponding offences).
Regulation 4 makes similar provision in relation to offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, for the purpose of section 2(2) of the Act. Section 2(1) of the Act provides that penalty notices for such offences may be issued by constables.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

This Order declares AECC University College to be an exempt charity within the meaning of the Charities Act 2011 with effect from 15th June 2023. An exempt charity cannot be registered with the Charity Commission and the Commission cannot exercise any powers under the Act in relation to an exempt charity except:
i)
it may exercise advisory and permissive powers at the charity’s request, following consultation with any principal regulator appointed under the Charities Act 2011;
ii)
it may open a statutory inquiry and use powers to act for the protection of charities at the invitation of any principal regulator appointed under the Charities Act.
The Office for Students (OfS) has been appointed principal regulator for exempt Higher Education Providers in England, and automatically becomes principal regulator for AECC University College.

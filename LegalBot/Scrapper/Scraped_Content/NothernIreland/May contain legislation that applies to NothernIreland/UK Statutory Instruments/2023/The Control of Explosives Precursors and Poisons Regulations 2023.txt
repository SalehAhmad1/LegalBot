At 12.45 p.m. on 23rd January 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations concern the supply of regulated and reportable substances (see section 2 of the Poisons Act 1972 (c. 66) (“the 1972 Act”) for definitions of a regulated substance and a reportable substance).
Regulations 2 to 6 impose various requirements on persons who are either involved in the supply of regulated or reportable substances (or, in the case of regulation 3, regulated explosives precursors only (this term is also defined by section 2 of the 1972 Act)), or who operate an online marketplace that is used by suppliers to make supplies of such substances.
Failure to comply with the requirements imposed by regulations 2 to 6 is a criminal offence (see section 7(4) of the 1972 Act).
Regulation 8 makes amendments to the lists of regulated and reportable substances that are found in Schedule 1A to the 1972 Act.
Regulation 9 makes amendments to regulation 2 of the Control of Poisons and Explosives Precursors Regulations 2015 (S. I. 2015/966) to remove references to licences issued or recognised in accordance with a provision of European Union law that has now been repealed.
A full impact assessment of the effect that these Regulations will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector has been undertaken. A copy is annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum which is available alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk. Copies may also be obtained from the Explosives Precursors and Poisons team at the Home Office, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF (precursorsandpoisons@homeoffice.gov.uk).

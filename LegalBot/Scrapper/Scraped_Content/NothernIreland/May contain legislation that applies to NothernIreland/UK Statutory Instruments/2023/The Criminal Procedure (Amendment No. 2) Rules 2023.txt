(i)
any evidence introduced, and
(ii)
any admission made; and

the court must explain, in terms the person to be bound over can understand (with help if necessary)—

(c)
specify the duration of the bind over; and
(d)
identify any surety who is not the person to be bound over.

there is a real risk of violence in the future perpetrated by—

Bind over: refusal or breach
31.11.—(1) Where a person to be bound over refuses to enter into a recognisance, the court must—
(a)
consider such other steps as may be available, for example continuing or starting a prosecution; and
(b)
treat committal to custody as a last resort.
(2) Where a person bound over is alleged to have breached a requirement, before the court forfeits the recognisance it must satisfy itself on the balance of probabilities that a breach has occurred.
(3) In addition to paragraph (1) or (2), as applicable, before committing to custody or forfeiting a recognisance the court must follow the procedure required by rule 48.8 (contempt of court by obstruction, disruption, etc.; procedure on enquiry) as if—
(a)
the refusal or breach were a contempt of court; and
(b)
the committal or forfeiture were a punishment for such a contempt.
[Note. Under section 1(7) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1968 if a person whom the court decides to bind over refuses to enter into a recognisance the court cancommit that person to custody.
Payment of the sum due under a recognisance that is forfeit can be enforced under section 58 of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980(8).]”; and

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes amendments to the Libya (Sanctions) (Overseas Territories) Order 2021 (S.I. 2021/37) (“the Principal Order”).
The Principal Order extends with modifications the Libya (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1665) (“the Libya sanctions regulations”) as amended from time to time to all British overseas territories except Bermuda and Gibraltar (which implement sanctions under their own legislative arrangements). The Libya sanctions regulations established a sanctions regime in relation to Libya for the purposes of complying with obligations the United Kingdom has by virtue of United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to Libya, and for the purposes of promoting respect for human rights in Libya, promoting the peace, stability and security of Libya, promoting the successful completion of Libya’s political transition, and preventing migrant smuggling and human trafficking from Libya.
This Order makes a correction to paragraph 26 of Schedule 2 of the Principal Order, to specify that the license grounds available in respect of the Libyan Investment Authority and Libyan Africa Investment Portfolio include the purpose of satisfying prior obligations as set out in Part 2 of Schedule 4.
An Impact Assessment has not been prepared for this Order: the territorial extent of both this Order and the Principal Order is the British overseas territories listed in the Schedule to this Order and no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sector in the United Kingdom.

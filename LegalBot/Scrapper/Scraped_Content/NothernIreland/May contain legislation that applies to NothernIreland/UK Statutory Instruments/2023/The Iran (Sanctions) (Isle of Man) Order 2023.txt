S.I. 2019/600, as applied to the Isle of Man by SD 2020/0479.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order extends to the Isle of Man with modifications the Iran (Sanctions) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1314) (“the Iran Regulations”) as amended from time to time.
Section 63(3)(b) of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c.13) (“the Sanctions Act”) provides that His Majesty may by Order in Council provide for any provision of Part 1 of that Act, or any regulations under Part 1 of that Act, to extend with or without modifications to the Isle of Man. Section 63(4) provides that this includes the power to extend any regulations as amended from time to time.
The Iran Regulations were made under Part 1 of the Sanctions Act to establish a sanctions regime in relation to Iran for the purpose of encouraging the Government of Iran to comply with international human rights law and to respect human rights and to deter Iran from conducting hostile activity against the United Kingdom and other countries.
The Iran Regulations, as modified and extended to the Isle of Man by this Order (“the modified Regulations”), provide that a person designated by the Secretary of State for being, or having been, involved in certain activities, is a designated person for the purposes of the modified Regulations. Designated persons may be excluded from the Isle of Man and may be made subject to financial sanctions, including having their funds or economic resources frozen
The modified Regulations impose trade restrictions on specified goods and technology which may be used to repress the civilian population of Iran (as specified in Schedule 2) and on specified goods and technology (as specified in Schedule 3) which may be used for interception and monitoring services in Iran. A further trade sanction that is imposed by these Regulations is to prohibit the provision of interception and monitoring services to, or for the benefit of, the Government of Iran. Part 6 also imposes trade restrictions on specified goods and technology which may be used by Iran to build and improve their unmanned aerial vehicle systems (as specified in Schedule 4).
The modified Regulations also prohibit ships owned, controlled, chartered or operated by a designated person, or where they are a specified ship, from entering ports in the Isle of Man. There is a notification and publicity requirement where the specification power is used. The Regulations provide the Secretary of State with a power to control the movement of ships owned, controlled, chartered or operated by a designated person, or specified ships, by requiring them to leave or enter specified ports, proceed to a specified place or remain where they are. The modified Regulations also confer powers to detain ships owned, controlled, chartered or operated by a designated person, or specified ships, at ports or anchorages. The registration of ships on the Manx Ship Register is prohibited where they are owned, controlled, chartered or operated by a designated person, or where they are a specified ship.
The modified Regulations provide for certain exceptions to this sanctions regime, in particular in relation to financial sanctions (for example to allow for frozen accounts to be credited with interest or other earnings) and also acts done for the purpose of national security or the prevention of serious crime. The Treasury of the Isle of Man may issue licences in respect of activities that would otherwise be prohibited under the financial and trade sanctions imposed. Schedule 5 sets out the purposes pursuant to which the Treasury will issue such licences.
The modified Regulations prescribe powers for the provision and sharing of information to enable the effective implementation and enforcement of the sanctions regime. The modified Regulations make it a criminal offence to contravene, or circumvent, any of the prohibitions in the modified Regulations and prescribe the penalties that apply to such offences.
The modified Regulations also confer powers on specified maritime enforcement officers to stop and search ships in international and foreign waters for the purpose of enforcing specified trade sanctions and to seize goods found on board ships which are being, or have been, dealt with in contravention, or deemed contravention, of those prohibitions.
This Order also extends to the Isle of Man for the purposes of the modified Regulations specific provisions of Part 1 of the Sanctions Act, namely provisions relating to guidance about prohibitions and requirements, protection for acts done for purposes of compliance and saving for prerogative powers.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this instrument because the territorial extent of the instrument and the modified Regulations is the Isle of Man; no, or no significant, impact is foreseen on the private, voluntary or public sector in the United Kingdom.

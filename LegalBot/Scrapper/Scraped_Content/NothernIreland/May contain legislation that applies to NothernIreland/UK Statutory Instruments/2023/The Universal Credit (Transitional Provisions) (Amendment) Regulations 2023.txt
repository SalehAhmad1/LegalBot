(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make further provision for transition to universal credit following the case of the Queen (on the application of) TP and AR (TP and AR No. 3) ([2022] EWHC 123 Admin), in which the court concluded that there was a difference in treatment between severe disability premium recipients who naturally migrated from legacy benefits to universal credit, by virtue of making a claim to universal credit as a result of a change in their circumstances, and those who remain on legacy benefits.
Regulation 2 inserts a new Schedule 3 into the Universal Credit (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1230). The Schedule provides for an additional amount of universal credit to be payable to certain claimants who were previously entitled to certain types of disability premiums in connection with their legacy benefits.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

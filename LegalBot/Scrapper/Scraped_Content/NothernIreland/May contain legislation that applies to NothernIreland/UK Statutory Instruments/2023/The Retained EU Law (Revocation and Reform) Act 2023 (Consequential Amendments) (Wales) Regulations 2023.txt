6 December 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in sections 19(1) and 20(1)(b) of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (c. 28) (“the 2023 Act”). Section 19(1) is the power to make appropriate provision in consequence of provisions of the 2023 Act and which by virtue of section 20(1) includes the ability to make supplementary, incidental, consequential, transitional, transitory or saving provision.
These Regulations make amendments to primary legislation and subordinate legislation which apply in relation to Wales, in consequence of the renaming of retained EU law (and related terms) as assimilated law (and related terms) at all times after the end of 2023, as set out in section 5 of the 2023 Act.
Part 2 of these Regulations makes consequential amendments to relevant primary legislation and Part 3 makes consequential amendments to relevant subordinate legislation.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

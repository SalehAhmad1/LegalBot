23rd February 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Police Pensions Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/445) (“the 2015 Regulations”) in respect of member contributions and pensionable earnings.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 33 of the 2015 Regulations, to clarify the position in respect of pensionable earnings of part-time members. Regulation 33 has been interpreted as excluding overtime payments to part-time members from pensionable earnings, contrary to the policy intention. As amended, regulation 33 does not distinguish between members in full-time and members in part-time service and provides that all pay to which members are entitled is pensionable pay. The amendments have retrospective effect, in reliance on the power in section 3(3)(b) of the Public Sector Pensions Act 2013 (c. 25).
Regulation 3 amends regulation 170 of the 2015 Regulations, which makes provision for the contributions payable by members of the scheme in the scheme years to 31st March 2023. Regulation 3 removes the end date so that the contribution rates will continue to apply for future scheme years. Since this involves a change to a protected element of the scheme constituted by the 2015 Regulations, the Secretary of State has consulted representatives of those likely to be affected by the change with a view to reaching agreement and has laid a report before Parliament.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector or community bodies is foreseen.

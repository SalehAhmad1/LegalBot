9th August 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument is part of a set of Regulations which implement Part 3 of the Building Safety Act 2022.
Section 91ZA of the Building Act 1984, which is to have effect from 1st October 2023, provides for the regulator to be the building control authority in relation to any higher-risk building in England and any proposed higher-risk building.
Part 2 of these Regulations makes a number of amendments to the Building Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2214). Regulation 3 inserts a number of new definitions.
Regulation 4 provides that most of the procedural requirements in the Building Regulations 2010 do not apply in relation to higher-risk buildings. (Instead the procedures set out in the Building (Higher-Risk Buildings Procedures) (England) Regulations 2023 apply).
Regulation 5 amends the exemption from requirements other than substantive requirements for the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime.
Regulation 6 inserts a new Part 2A into the Building Regulations 2010. This new Part sets out the arrangements a client in relation to a project must make, including the appointment in most cases of a principal contractor and a principal designer, and provisions as to the duties and competence of persons working on a project. Regulation 6 also provides that the client must notify the relevant authority where the principal contractor or principal designer in relation to the work changes, and that after completion of the work the client must send a notice to the authority which includes compliance statements as to the work.
Regulation 7 changes a number of references to deposit of plans to applications for building control approval, and a number of references to local authorities to building control authority (which term includes the regulator).
Regulation 8 inserts new provisions, equivalent to those which were in section 16 of the Building Act 1984, in relation to applications for building control approval, and regulation 9 inserts new provision, equivalent to article 45 of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, in relation to consultation on applications.
Regulation 10 makes provision in relation to the procedure for appeals under the Building Act 1984 – Part 3 of the Building Safety Act 2022 provided for a number of new rights of appeal, and moved most appeals from the Secretary of State to the regulator and from the magistrates’ court to the First-tier Tribunal.
Regulation 11 makes provision under section 91ZB of the Building Act 1984 in relation to regulator’s notices.
Regulation 12 amends regulations 20 and 20A of the Building Regulations 2010 to provide that the client for the project ensures the person carrying out work in relation to a higher-risk building is aware the building is a higher-risk building.
Regulation 13 amends regulation 38 of the Building Regulations 2010 to provide that the responsible person must acknowledge receipt of the fire safety information provided pursuant to regulation 38, and the notice to the building control authority as to handover of fire safety information confirms the information was received by the responsible person.

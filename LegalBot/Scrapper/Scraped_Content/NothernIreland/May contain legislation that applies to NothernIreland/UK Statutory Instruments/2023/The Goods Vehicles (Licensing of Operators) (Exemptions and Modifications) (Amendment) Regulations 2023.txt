(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulations relating to the licensing of operators to provide for vehicles brought temporarily into Great Britain.
These Regulations revoke and replace the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Temporary Use in Great Britain) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/2186) (“the 1996 Regulations”).
Part 1: Preliminary provisions
Part 1 contains preliminary provisions relating to citation, commencement and extent.
Part 2: Amendment of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995
Part 2 amends the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/2869) (“the 1995 Regulations”).
Regulations 3 to 6 make amendments relating to interpretation and the introduction of the Schedules providing for classes of vehicle for which an operator’s licence is not required and modifications of legislative provisions in relation to certain vehicles brought temporarily into Great Britain which are not exempted from the licence requirement.
Classes of vehicle for which an operator’s licence is not required
Regulation 7 inserts a new Part 3 in Schedule 3 to the 1995 Regulations (classes of vehicles for which a licence is not required).
New Part 3 includes classes of vehicle brought temporarily into Great Britain for the carriage of goods by international operators in countries with which the United Kingdom has an international agreement relating to the transport of goods by road to, from or through the United Kingdom.
The effect of new Part 3 is to exempt users of the classes of vehicle from the requirement under section 2(1) of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 (c. 23) to hold an operator’s licence issued under that Act.
New Part 3 provides unilateral exemptions for persons using vehicles:
registered in the Channel Islands, the Faroe Islands, the Isle of Man or Gibraltar (see paragraph 66 of new Part 3);
used in limited circumstances by operators that have an effective and stable establishment in a country other than the United Kingdom or a member State of the European Union (see paragraph 68 of new Part 3).
In addition, there are exemptions relating to Northern Ireland goods vehicles.
The remainder of the exemptions implement or re-implement obligations under the following international road transport agreements to which the United Kingdom is a party.

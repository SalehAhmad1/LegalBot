(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/376) (“the UC Regulations”).

The amendment provides for certain payments made by the Secretary of State to be taken into account in determining the charges for childcare costs paid by the claimant. This is where the claimant is taking up or increasing their hours of paid work and needs to pay upfront childcare costs in order to do so.
Regulation 2(3) amends regulation 36 of the UC Regulations and increases the maximum amount which can be paid in respect of childcare costs in universal credit.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sector is foreseen.

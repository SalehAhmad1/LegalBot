1st November 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Childcare (Childminder Agencies) (Cancellation etc.) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/1922) (“the 2014 Regulations”) make provision for the cancellation, termination and suspension from registration of providers of childcare who are registered with childminder agencies under Part 3 of the Childcare Act 2006 (“the Act”).
These Regulations amend the 2014 Regulations. Regulation 2 inserts new regulations 15 and 16, which make provision for the termination of the registration of providers with a childminder agency where a childminder agency is removed at its request from either or both of the early years register or the general childcare register by the Chief Inspector under section 70A of the Act. Providers who do not wish to opt out will be deemed to be registered in the relevant register maintained by the Chief Inspector for a period of six months. This will not be the case in respect of providers who have indicated to the Chief Inspector that they do not wish to be registered in the relevant register or if it appears to the Chief Inspector that the provider is disqualified. In those circumstances, the provider’s registration will remain terminated for the purposes of Part 3 of the Act.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

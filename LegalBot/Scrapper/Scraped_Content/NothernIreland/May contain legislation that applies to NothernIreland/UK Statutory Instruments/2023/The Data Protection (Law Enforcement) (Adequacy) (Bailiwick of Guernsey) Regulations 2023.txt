These Regulations specify the Bailiwick of Guernsey (“Guernsey”) as a third country which provides an adequate level of protection of personal data for the purposes of Part 3 (law enforcement processing) of the Data Protection Act 2018 (c. 12).
This means that personal data can be transferred by UK competent authorities to relevant authorities in Guernsey (authorities with comparable law enforcement functions to a UK competent authority), which are subject to the relevant Guernsey data protection legislation (specifically the Data Protection (Law Enforcement and Related Matters) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Ordinance, 2018) without the need for any specific authorisation.

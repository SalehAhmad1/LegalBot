(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend Schedule 4 to the Export Control Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/3231) (“the 2008 Order”) and Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 setting up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items (Recast) (EUR 2009/428) (“the retained Dual-Use Regulation”).
Regulation 2 omits Syria from the list in Part 2 of Schedule 4 to the 2008 Order. This change is to remedy an ambiguity in the 2008 Order as to the position of Syria in Schedule 4.
Regulation 3 amends Annex I to the retained Dual-Use Regulation, which lists dual-use goods, software and technology subject to export controls. These changes are to correct two drafting errors introduced by the Export Control (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/695) in which words already contained in the retained Dual-Use Regulation were inserted a second time.

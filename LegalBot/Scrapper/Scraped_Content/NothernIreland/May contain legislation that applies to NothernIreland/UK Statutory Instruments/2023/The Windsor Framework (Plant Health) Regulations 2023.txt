(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement the Windsor Framework(1) in respect of rules relating to plant health movements. They regulate the movement of certain plants and other objects from Great Britain to Northern Ireland by making provision in relation to a Northern Ireland plant health label in certain circumstances.
Parts 2 and 3 extend to Great Britain.
Part 2 makes provision for the registration of professional operators in relation to the use of a Northern Ireland plant health label for the movement of plants for planting, seed potatoes and machinery and vehicles which have been operated for agricultural or forestry purposes from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, in accordance with Part 3.
Part 3 makes provision in relation to the issuance of Northern Ireland plant health labels and imposes obligations on professional operators and competent authorities in relation to this. Issuance and attachment of such labels must take place before the plants and other objects concerned are dispatched to Northern Ireland. It makes provision in relation to the granting of authorisations to professional operators to issue those labels, or to receive and use labels issued by the competent authority.
It further makes provision in relation to the nature and frequency of inspections to be carried about by the competent authority in order to verify compliance with relevant requirements. It allows for replacement and invalidation of labels in certain circumstances, and it requires the fulfilment of certain conditions for the dispatch of the plants and other objects to Northern Ireland.
Part 4 extends to Northern Ireland and makes amendments to the Plant Health (Official Controls and Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (S.R. 2020 No. 293) to relax restrictions on the planting of seed potatoes.
A full impact assessment has not been published for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(3) Case 2 is where the Bank has made—

(5) For the purposes of this Part, a property transfer instrument which purports to transfer all of the property, rights or liabilities of a CCP(5) must be treated as having done so effectively (and so must not be treated as a partial property transfer), notwithstanding the possibility that any of the property, rights or liabilities are foreign and may not have been effectively transferred by the property transfer instrument by virtue of steps taken under paragraph 62 of the Schedule (foreign property).

(c)

(2) A partial property transfer to which this Part applies may not—

(b)
transfer the benefit of the security unless the liability which is secured is also transferred;
(c)
transfer the liability unless the benefit of the security is also transferred;
(d)
include provision under the continuity powers which terminates or modifies the arrangement if the effect of that provision is to provide that the liability is no longer secured against the property or rights.

(2) The partial property transfer is void so far as it was made in contravention of those provisions of this Part.Set-off and netting

(2) The partial property transfer does not affect the exercise of the right to set-off or net.Contravention of other provisions of this Part
11.—(1) Subject to paragraph (2), this regulation applies where any person (“P”) considers that a partial property transfer has been made in contravention of any provision of this Part, and that, as a result, the property, rights or liabilities of P have been affected.

(a)
be given within 60 days of the day on which the partial property transfer took effect;

(10) The property, rights or liabilities which are transferred under paragraph (7) may be the same property, rights or liabilities which were, in contravention of this Part, transferred or not transferred (as the case may be) or, if the transfer of such property, rights or liabilities is not practicable, property, rights or liabilities which, in the opinion of the Bank, are equivalent to those property, rights or liabilities.Application
12.  This Part applies to an instrument which makes write-down provision.Set-off and netting
13.—(1) An instrument to which this Part applies may not make write-down provision in respect of a protected liability (subject to paragraph (6)).
(2) In this regulation, a “protected liability” is a write-down liability which is not within paragraph (3), and meets the following conditions—
(a)
condition 1 is that the liability is owed by the CCP to a person (“P”);

(c)
condition 3 is that—
(i)
where the liability relates to a derivative, financial contract or qualifying master agreement (see regulation 14 (meaning of “derivative”, “financial contract” and “qualifying master agreement”)), it has not been converted into a net debt, claim or obligation, whether in accordance with the relevant arrangements or through the making of a write-down provision or otherwise;
(ii)
where the liability relates to any other type of contract, it has neither been converted nor treated as if it had been converted into a net debt, claim or obligation, whether in accordance with the relevant arrangements or through the making of write-down provision or otherwise.
(3) The following liabilities are not protected liabilities—
(a)
liabilities in relation to an unsecured debt instrument which is a transferrable security issued by that CCP, and for these purposes a “debt instrument” is any instrument falling within article 77 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order 2001(1) (instruments creating or acknowledging indebtedness);

(f)
liabilities which relate to a claim for damages or an award of damages or a claim under an indemnity.
(4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)—
(a)
it does not matter whether—
(i)
the arrangements which permit P or the CCP to set-off or net the liability also permit P or the CCP to set-off or net rights and liabilities with another person;
(ii)
the right of P or the CCP to set-off or net is exercisable only on the occurrence of a particular event;
(b)
a liability is treated as if it is converted into a net debt, claim or obligation if the amount due in relation to the liability is reduced by reference to any sums which the debtor would be able to set off against the liability in the event that the debtor decided to exercise set-off or netting rights.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (3), undertakings are in the same group if they are group undertakings in respect of each other, and “group undertaking” has the meaning given in section 1161(5) of the Companies Act 2006(2).
(6) Paragraph (1) does not prevent write-down provision from being made in order to convert, or in connection with converting, the protected liability into—
(a)
the net debt, claim or obligation that would be due under the set-off arrangements, netting arrangements or title transfer collateral arrangements at the time the write-down provision providing for this is made; or
(b)
an estimate of that net debt, claim or obligation.

be given within a period of 60 days beginning with the day on which the instrument was made;

(4) P must also, on request, provide such additional information as the Bank may reasonably require.

if it does not agree that a provision of this Part has been contravened in the manner specified in the notice, take the steps specified in paragraph (6);

if it agrees that a provision of this Part has been contravened in the manner specified in the notice, take the steps specified in—
(i)
paragraph (7), where the Bank has not exercised the bridge central counterparty stabilisation option(1) in addition to making write-down provision; or
(ii)
paragraph (8) where, in addition to having made write-down provision, the Bank has at any time exercised the bridge central counterparty stabilisation option.
(6) The steps are to give reasons to P as to why the Bank considers that no provision of this Part has been contravened in the manner specified in the notice.
(7) The steps are to remedy the contravention—
(a)
where practicable—
(i)
by requiring the CCP to issue securities; or
(ii)
by transferring securities issued by the CCP,
which the Bank estimates to have a value equal to the relevant sum, to P; or
(b)
otherwise, by requiring the CCP to transfer the relevant sum to P,
whether by exercising a power under the Schedule or otherwise.
(8) The steps are to remedy the contravention by either—
(a)
requiring the CCP or bridge central counterparty to issue securities which the Bank estimates to have a value equal to the relevant sum to P;
(b)
transferring securities issued by the CCP or bridge central counterparty which the Bank estimates to have a value equal to the relevant sum to P; or
(c)
requiring the CCP or bridge central counterparty to transfer the relevant sum to P,
whether by exercising a power under the Schedule or otherwise.

(2) The Bank may extend the initial period by a period of up to 120 days if the condition in paragraph (4) is met (“the initial period and first extended period”).
(3) The Bank may extend the initial period and first extended period by a period of up to 120 days if the condition in paragraph (4) is met.
(4) The condition is that the Bank considers that the matters raised in the notice under regulation 15(2) are of such complexity that it is impracticable to take a decision without granting the extension.
(5) Where the Bank extends time under paragraph (2) or (3), the Bank must as soon as reasonably practicable inform the person who gave the notice under regulation 15(2) of the extension of time and the duration of the extension.Revocation of the Banking Act 2009 (Restriction of Partial Property Transfers) (Recognised Central Counterparties) Order 2014.

4th December 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations restrict the making of certain instruments where stabilisation powers are exercised under Schedule 11 (central counterparties) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (c. 29). Schedule 11 (“the Schedule”) makes provision establishing a special resolution regime for central counterparties (“CCPs”). It provides the Bank of England with stabilisation powers to exercise various stabilisation options where a CCP has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties, as set out in paragraph 1 of the Schedule. This includes the power to make property transfer instruments, and write-down instruments.
Prior to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, the provisions relating to resolution of banks and other financial institutions in Part 1 (special resolution regime) of the Banking Act 2009 (c. 1) (“the 2009 Act”) applied to CCPs (with modifications). As set out below, statutory instruments were made which restricted the circumstances in which the Bank, in exercising its powers under Part 1, could make instruments which included partial property transfers or special bail-in provision. A partial property transfer instrument provides for the transfer of some, but not all, of the property, rights and liabilities of an entity subject to resolution, and the Schedule contains similar powers in this respect to those in Part 1 of the 2009 Act. Additionally, paragraphs 34 and 35 of the Schedule create a power for the Bank of England to make instruments which write-down liabilities of a CCP in resolution, which is similar to the special bail-in provision in section 12A of the 2009 Act.
Part 2 of these Regulations restricts the making of partial property transfer instruments under the Schedule and also makes provision to protect certain interests where a partial property transfer has been made in respect of a CCP, including security interests, set-off arrangements and netting arrangements. This Part broadly replicates the provisions in the Banking Act 2009 (Restriction of Partial Property Transfers) (Recognised Central Counterparties) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/1828) for the purposes of the new special resolution regime for CCPs in the Schedule.
Regulation 2 sets out the circumstances in which these restrictions apply.
Regulation 3 provides that where a CCP operates separate default funds for different classes of financial instruments, all the rights and liabilities that attach to each separate default fund must be transferred together, and that where a CCP operates a single default fund, all rights and liabilities attaching to the single default fund must be transferred together.
Regulation 4 prohibits a partial property transfer (or the exercise of any related continuity power) from separating from any transferred liability any security that attaches to that liability.
Regulation 5 prohibits a partial property transfer (or the exercise of any related continuity power) from rendering unenforceable a market contract (within the meaning of section 155(1)(d) of the Companies Act 1989 (c. 40).
Regulation 6 places limitations on the exercise of the power provided in paragraph 55(7)(a) of the Schedule (effect of property transfer instrument). This power allows for a partial property transfer to remove or alter the terms of any trust upon which the transferred property was held prior to the transfer.
Regulation 7 provides for additional limits to apply to reverse property transfers under paragraphs 70 or 72 of the Schedule. These protections limit what property may (or may not be) transferred under a reverse transfer.
Regulation 8 restricts partial property transfers in respect of the property, rights or liabilities of a company that is in the same group as the CCP. Any such transfers may only be made where they are necessary for carrying on the business, or any part of the business, of any CCP which is (or, but for the exercise of a stabilisation power, would be) in the same group as the company.
Regulations 9 to 11 provide for remedies for contraventions of the provisions in Part 2 of the Regulations.
Part 3 of these Regulations imposes restrictions on the making of write-down provision (as defined in paragraph 34(2) of the Schedule) in instruments made under the Schedule. This Part broadly replicates the provisions in the Banking Act 2009 (Restriction of Special Bail-in Provision, etc) Order 2014 (S.I. 2014/3350), insofar as it applied to CCPs, for the purposes of the new special resolution regime for CCPs in the Schedule.
Regulation 13 provides that write-down provision cannot be made in respect of protected liabilities. Protected liabilities are liabilities subject to set-off or netting, which are not excluded from protection under regulation 13(3), and in the case of liabilities relating to derivatives, other financial contracts or certain master agreements, which have not been set-off or netted. Regulation 13 does not prevent write-down provision from being made to convert the protected liability into the net sum that would be due following set-off or netting (or into an estimate of the net sum). Regulation 14 provides definitions for certain terms used in regulation 13.
Regulations 15 and 16 provide the remedy for contraventions of the provisions in Part 3 of the Regulations.
Part 4 of these Regulations contains provision revoking the Banking Act 2009 (Restriction of Partial Property Transfers) (Recognised Central Counterparties) Order 2014 (see regulation 17). Regulation 18 makes transitional provision in respect of this revocation, so that the 2014 Order will continue to apply in respect of any relevant instruments made by the Bank before 31st December 2023, or on or after 31st December 2023 in reliance on any regulations made under section 83 or 84 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 where a CCP entered into special resolution under the 2009 Act before that date.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. These Regulations will largely replicate the effects of existing legislation, as set out above.

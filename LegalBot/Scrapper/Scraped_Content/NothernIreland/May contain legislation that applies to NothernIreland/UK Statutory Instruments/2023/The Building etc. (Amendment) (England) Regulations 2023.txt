(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make minor changes and a correction in relation to England to the amendments made to the Building Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2214) (“the Building Regulations”) by the Building Regulations etc. (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/1391) and by the Building etc. (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/603). They also make an amendment to the transitional provisions in the Building Regulations etc. (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2021.
Regulation 2(2) makes a correction in the name of the European fire classifications at regulation 7(3)(k) of the Building Regulations. This provision of the Building Regulations regulates the use of combustible materials on balcony floors in tall buildings. Regulation 2(3) adds compliance with the target primary energy rate to the list of requirements that must be met before a completion certificate may be issued by a local authority.
Regulation 2(4) amends the Building Regulations so that where work is subject to an initial notice, the requirements to give the local authority documentation on compliance with fabric energy efficiency rate calculations and target primary energy rate calculations does not apply.
Regulation 3 makes an amendment to the transitional provisions in the Building Regulations etc. (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2021 to ensure that building work in respect of multiple dwellings which benefits from a transitional provision from 2013 does not lose that transitional protection.

Impact assessments were produced for the amendments made to the Building Regulations by the Building Regulations etc. (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2021 and the Building etc. (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2022.

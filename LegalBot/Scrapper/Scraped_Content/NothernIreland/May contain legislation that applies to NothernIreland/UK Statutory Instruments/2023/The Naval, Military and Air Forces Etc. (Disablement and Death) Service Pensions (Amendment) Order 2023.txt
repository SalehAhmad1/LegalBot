(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 2006 (“the principal Order”), which makes provision for pensions and other awards in respect of disablement or death due to service before 6th April 2005 in the naval, military and air forces. The principal Order contains the scheme which provides the pensions and other awards.
The Tables in Schedules 1 to 5 to this Order replace tables in Schedules 1 and 2 to the principal Order, in order to adjust the rates prescribed for retired pay, pensions, gratuities and allowances in respect of disablement or death due to service in the armed forces. A minor amendment to the heading of the table in Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the principal Order corrects an error in the time period to which the table applies which was introduced by S.I. 2012/359.
Article 5 amends the definition of “terminal illness” such that a person is terminally ill where their death, as a result of a progressive disease, can reasonably be expected within 12 months, as opposed to 6 months prior to the amendment.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

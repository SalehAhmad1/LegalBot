17th March 2023EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order designates the independent schools listed in article 3(1) as having the religious character specified in article 3(2). Article 4 of this Order revokes the instruments listed in article 4 to the extent set out in that article. All revocations relate to schools that have closed.
Under section 124A of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, independent schools which are designated are permitted to take account of certain religious or denominational considerations when making specified employment decisions relating to teaching staff (such as decisions on appointment or promotion).
Designation by this Order is not of itself a means of acquiring a religious character or of changing religious character. Designation is the recognition of certain existing attributes of the school or its governing body as described in the Religious Character of Schools (Designation Procedure) (Independent Schools) (England) Regulations 2003 (S.I. 2003/2314, as amended by S.I. 2004/2262).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

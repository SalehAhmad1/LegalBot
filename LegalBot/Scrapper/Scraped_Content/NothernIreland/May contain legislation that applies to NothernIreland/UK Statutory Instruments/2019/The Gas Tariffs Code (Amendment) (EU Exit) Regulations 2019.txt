(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a) to (c) and (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Schedule 5 to the Gas (Security of Supply and Network Codes) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/531) (“the 2019 Regulations”) amends Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/460 (“the Tariffs Code”) which establishes a network code on harmonised transmission tariff structures for gas.
Regulation 2 introduces the Schedule which amends Schedule 5 to the 2019 Regulations. These amendments are required as a result of changes to what will be retained EU law on exit day as a consequence of the postponement of exit day beyond 31st May 2019, the date from which Chapters II, III and IV of the Tariffs Code apply.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

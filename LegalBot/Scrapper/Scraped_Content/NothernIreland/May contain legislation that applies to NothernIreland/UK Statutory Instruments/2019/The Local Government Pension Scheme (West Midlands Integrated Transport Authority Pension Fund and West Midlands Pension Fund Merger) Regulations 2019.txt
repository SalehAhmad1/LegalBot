From 1st April 2019 the West Midlands Combined Authority is no longer required to maintain the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority Pension Fund for the purposes of the Local Government Pension Scheme. All assets and liabilities relating to the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority Pension Fund up to that date are transferred to Wolverhampton which becomes the appropriate administering authority for all members of the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority Pension Fund. Regulation 4 makes further provision in relation to the establishment of new admission agreement funds for the admission bodies that previously participated in the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority Pension Fund.
No impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations because no impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

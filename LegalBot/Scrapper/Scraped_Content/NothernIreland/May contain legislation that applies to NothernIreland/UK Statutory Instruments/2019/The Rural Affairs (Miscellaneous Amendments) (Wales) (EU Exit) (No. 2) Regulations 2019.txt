(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the power conferred by paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation relating to animals and plant health.
Regulation 2 makes amendments to the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Wales) Regulations 2011 (“the TARP Regulations”).
Regulation 2(2) omits the definition of “product” from the TARP Regulations. It also inserts a definition of “the published nomenclature list” into the TARP Regulations to account for the introduction of a list of animal products, published by the Secretary of State, which specifies products for the purposes of determining the selection of consignments that must be submitted to veterinary checks at a border inspection post. Additionally, it makes provision for the purpose of interpreting references to an EU Directive in the TARP Regulations and associated EU instruments.
Regulation 2(3) inserts references to the Faroe Islands and Greenland into regulation 4 of the TARP Regulations, which provides for how trade with a number of specified territories is to be treated for the purpose of the TARP Regulations.
Regulation 2(4) and (5) substitute references in the TARP Regulations to EU legislation for references to the published nomenclature list.
Regulation 2(6) makes amendments to regulation 15 of the TARP Regulations, which relates to import procedures. Among those changes is a substitution that imposes a requirement on the person responsible for a consignment to arrange for the consignment and a health certificate to be submitted for checks at the border inspection.
Regulation 2(7) makes provision so that the composite products and foodstuffs listed by the Secretary of State as being exempt from veterinary import checks are not subject to Part 3 of the TARP Regulations, which itself provides for the importation into Wales of any animal or product specified in Commission Decision 2007/275/EC from a country outside the EU.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 28(c) of the Plant Health (Amendment) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 which, in part, omits article 21(7) of the Plant Health (Wales) Order 2018. Regulation 28(c) is amended to reflect that article 21(7) has been omitted by the Plant Health (Wales) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2019.
Regulation 4 makes a minor amendment to a previous statutory instrument, namely the Rural Affairs, Environment, Fisheries and Food (Miscellaneous Amendments and Revocations) (Wales) Regulations 2019 in the field of animal health and welfare. The amendment removes an erroneous provision in that instrument relating to regulation 20(1)(a) of the African Horse Sickness (Wales) Regulations 2013 (S.I. 2013/1662 (W. 158)) which has been identified as being in conflict with a similar amendment in an EU exit instrument.
The Welsh Ministers' Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, it was not considered necessary to carry out a regulatory impact assessment as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations.

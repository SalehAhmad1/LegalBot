Two of the Lord Commissioners of Her Majesty's TreasuryEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in consequence of, or otherwise in connection with, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
Regulation 1 provides that the Regulations are to come into force on such day or days as the Treasury may appoint.
Regulation 2 makes consequential amendments to Group 5 of Schedule 9 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (c. 23) as a consequence of amendments made by other exit legislation affecting collective investment schemes, including the Collective Investment Schemes (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/325) and the Financial Services (Gibraltar) (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/589).
Regulation 3 omits regulation 6 and Part 3 from the Value Added Tax (Miscellaneous Amendments, Revocation and Transitional Provisions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“S.I. 2019/513”).
Regulation 4 makes transitional provision in relation to the VAT MOSS (mini one stop shop) system to allow Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to prescribe the form or manner for making claims and corrections in respect of supplies that took place before exit day, so that such claims and corrections can continue to be made in the event that there is no longer access to the MOSS system.
Regulation 5 makes transitional provision in relation to Part 20 of the Value Added Tax Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/2518) (repayments to Community traders).
Part 5 (regulations 6 to 15) makes consequential amendments to the Fulfilment Businesses Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/326) (“the 2018 Regulations”) in line with changes made by the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018 (c. 22) to Part 3 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2017 (c. 32). It also makes transitional provisions in relation to secondary and primary legislation relating to fulfilment businesses.

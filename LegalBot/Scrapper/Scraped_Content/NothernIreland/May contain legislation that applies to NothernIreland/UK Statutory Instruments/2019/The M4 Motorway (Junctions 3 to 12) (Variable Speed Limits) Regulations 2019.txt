(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations introduce variable speed limits to—
(a)
the eastbound and the westbound carriageways of the M4 motorway between junctions 3 and 12; and
(b)
certain roads for joining and for leaving the M4 motorway between those junctions.
Regulation 3 provides for variable speed limits to have effect on the roads specified in paragraph 1 of the Schedule. Where variable speed limit signs are in operation a vehicle may not be driven at a speed above the maximum indicated by each speed limit sign passed by a vehicle, until it passes a sign indicating that the national speed limit applies or the vehicle leaves the roads covered by the regulation. Where a speed limit changes less than ten seconds before a vehicle passes the sign and the sign had indicated a higher speed limit, the regulation allows the driver to proceed at a speed up to the maximum applicable before the change. Where the speed limit sign indicates a speed limit when it is passed by a vehicle but less than ten seconds previously it was either giving no indication of a speed limit or that the national speed limit applied, the sign is to be taken as giving no indication of a speed limit to the vehicle passing it.
Regulation 4 amends the M4 Motorway (Hillingdon and Hounslow) (Speed Limits) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 2002/1651) to allow variable speed limits to operate on certain roads to which these 2002 Regulations apply a maximum speed limit of 60 miles per hour and to extend the length of one of those roads.
Contravention of these Regulations is an offence under section 17(4) of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for these Regulations as no impact on the cost of business or the voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the Regulations at www.legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 1996, the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 and the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations 2013 so that the maximum period of a higher-level sanction under section 19 of the Jobseekers Act 1995 is 26 weeks and the maximum period of a higher-level sanction under section 6J of the Jobseekers Act 1995 and section 26 of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 is 182 days.
Transitional provisions are also made which apply where, on the date that the Regulations come into force, the amount of an award of jobseeker’s allowance or universal credit is subject to a reduction for a higher-level sanction for a period of 156 weeks or 1095 days, as the case may be. In such a case, the reduction is to be terminated when the award of jobseeker’s allowance or universal credit has been reduced for a period of at least 26 weeks or 182 days, as the case may be.
This means that where, on the date that these Regulations come into force, an award which is subject to a reduction for a higher-level sanction for a period of 156 weeks or 1095 days—
has been reduced for at least 26 weeks or 182 days, the reduction will be terminated on that date;
has been reduced for less than 26 weeks or 182 days, the reduction will terminate once the award has been reduced for 26 weeks or 182 days.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on the flying of unmanned aircraft in the vicinity of the Port 
of Dover. In view of the need for security in this location due to its status as critical national 
infrastructure, at the request of the Port of Dover Police, the Secretary of State considers that the 
flying of unmanned aircraft should be restricted in the vicinity of that location. 
In relation to regulation 3, the term ‘unmanned aircraft’ includes aircraft as classified by Part 1 of 
Schedule 4 to the Air Navigation Order 2016 and includes a small unmanned aircraft (as defined 
in Schedule 1 to the Order) but the restriction does not apply to a balloon or a kite. These aircraft 
types are commonly referred to as drones. 
The times mentioned in this instrument are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC), which for the 
purposes of this instrument is the same time as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

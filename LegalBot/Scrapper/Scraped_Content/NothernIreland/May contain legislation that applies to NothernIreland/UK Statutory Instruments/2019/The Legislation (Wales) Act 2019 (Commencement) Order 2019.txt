(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order brings Part 2 of the Legislation (Wales) Act 2019, which makes provision about the interpretation and operation of Welsh legislation, fully into force on 1 January 2020. Part 2 of the Act will therefore apply to Assembly Acts that receive Royal Assent on or after 1 January 2020, and to Welsh subordinate instruments made on or after that date.
The Order also amends provisions that refer to the day on which Part 2 comes into force, so that they refer instead to 1 January 2020.

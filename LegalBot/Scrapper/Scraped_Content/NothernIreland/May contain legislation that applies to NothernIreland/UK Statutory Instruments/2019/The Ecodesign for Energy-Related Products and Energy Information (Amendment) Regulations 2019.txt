(This note is not part of the Regulations)
This instrument amends regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in relation to ecodesign and energy labelling. Regulation 2 amends the Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/2617) to add a Commission Regulation on servers and data storage (Regulation 2019/424) to the list of implementing measures that must be included in a declaration of conformity, and make a related consequential amendment. Regulation 3 makes an amendment to the Energy Information Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/1524) consequential on the annulment(1) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 665/2013 on the energy labelling of vacuum cleaners.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

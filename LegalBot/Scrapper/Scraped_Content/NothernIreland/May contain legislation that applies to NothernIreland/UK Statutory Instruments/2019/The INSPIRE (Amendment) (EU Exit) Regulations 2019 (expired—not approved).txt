EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular in section 8(2)(a), (b), (d), (f) and (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 amends deficiencies in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1372 implementing Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards monitoring and reporting, which has replaced Commission Decision 2009/442/EEC. Regulation 2 also amends Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2019/1372 to address deficiencies that arise from the amendment of Article 21 of Directive 2007/2/EC by Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1010 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the alignment of reporting obligations in the field of legislation related to the environment.
Regulations 3 to 5 make consequential amendments to the INSPIRE (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1338), the INSPIRE (EU Exit) (Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2019 (S.S.I. 2019/103) and the Environment (Legislative Functions from Directives) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 to reflect that new EU Decision.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In particular, the Regulations address the deficiency specified in section 8(2)(b) of that Act, namely the conferral of functions by retained EU law on, or in relation to, EU entities which no longer have functions in that respect under EU law in relation to the United Kingdom.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of food and, in particular, amend legislation relating to specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin and organisation of official controls on products of animal origin for human consumption. Part 2 amends subordinate legislation which extends to the whole of the United Kingdom. The amendment made by Part 2 revokes an earlier regulation so that a revised approach to the amendment of retained direct EU legislation may be taken by way of Part 3 of these Regulations. Part 3 amends retained direct EU legislation for the whole of the United Kingdom.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

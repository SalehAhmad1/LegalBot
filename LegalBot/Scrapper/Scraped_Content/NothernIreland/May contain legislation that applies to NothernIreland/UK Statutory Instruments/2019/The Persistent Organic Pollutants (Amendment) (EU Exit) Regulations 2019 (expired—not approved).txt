EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular section 8(2)(a), (b), (c) and (g) and (9)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of environmental protection and, in particular, amend legislation on, or in relation to, persistent organic pollutants. Part 2 contains amendments to retained direct EU legislation. Part 3 revokes Part 4 of the Persistent Organic Pollutants (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1405) and regulation 2 of the Environment and Wildlife (Legislative Functions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/473), and amends the Chemicals (Health and Safety) and Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

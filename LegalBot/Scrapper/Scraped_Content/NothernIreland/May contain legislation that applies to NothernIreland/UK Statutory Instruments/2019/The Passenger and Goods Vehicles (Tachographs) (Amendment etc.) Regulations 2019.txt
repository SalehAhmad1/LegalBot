ROAD TRAFFIC
The Passenger and Goods Vehicles (Tachographs) (Amendment etc.) Regulations 2019
Made
23rd October 2019
Coming into force in accordance with regulation 1
The Secretary of State makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 95(1) and 101(2) of the Transport Act 1968(1) and section 2(2) of, as read with paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, the European Communities Act 1972(2).
The Secretary of State is a Minister designated for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 in relation to the regulation of the type, description, construction or equipment of vehicles(3) and the regulation and supervision of working conditions of persons engaged in road transport(4).
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Secretary of State that it is expedient for the reference to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/799 implementing Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the requirements for the construction, testing, installation, operation and repair of tachographs and their components, to be construed as a reference to that instrument as amended from time to time.
The Secretary of State has consulted with such representative organisations as he thought fit in accordance with section 101(6) of the Transport Act 1968.
In accordance with section 101(3A) of the Transport Act 1968(5) and paragraph 2(2) and 2A of Schedule 2 to the European Communities Act 1972 a draft of these Regulations has been laid before and approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament.

23rd October 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Transport Act 1968 and the Drivers’ Hours and Tachographs (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/453).
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2016/799 of 18 March 2016 implementing Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the requirements for the construction, testing, installation, operation and repair of tachographs and their components gives effect to new requirements in relation to the construction, testing, installation, operation and repair of smart tachographs. The amendments in these Regulations are necessary to ensure that effective enforcement action may be taken if the requirements in relation to smart tachographs are breached.
Part 1 of the Regulations contains an introductory provision. Part 2 contains the amendments to the Transport Act 1968 that will enable the new provisions in relation to smart tachographs to be effectively enforced. Part 3 removes overlapping amendments to the Transport Act 1968 made by the Drivers’ Hours and Tachographs (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 that are not yet in force and will no longer be needed from Exit day as a consequence.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private and voluntary sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside this instrument on www.legislaton.gov.uk.

Department for Environment, Food and Rural AffairsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 8(1) of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a), (b), (d) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.
The Regulations amend retained direct EU legislation in the fields of the common organisation of markets in agricultural products and the common agricultural policy. The purpose of most of the amendments is to replace powers for the European Commission to make tertiary legislation with corresponding powers for the Secretary of State to make regulations.

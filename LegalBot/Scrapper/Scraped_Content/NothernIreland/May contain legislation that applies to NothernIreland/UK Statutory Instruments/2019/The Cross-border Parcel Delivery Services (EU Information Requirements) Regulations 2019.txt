29th October 2019EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement Regulation (EU) 2018/644 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 April 2018 on cross-border parcel delivery services to the extent that it has not been implemented by existing legislation and procedures. The EU parcel services regulation sets out the minimum harmonisation requirements for cross-border parcel delivery service providers.
Regulation 2 amends section 55 of the Postal Services Act 2011 and regulation 3 amends Schedule 8 to the Act to ensure that OFCOM’s information gathering powers and enforcement powers extend to infringements of the EU parcel services regulation.

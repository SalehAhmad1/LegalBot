These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers conferred by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular deficiencies referred to in section 8(2)(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g)) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to retained direct EU legislation in the field of licensing of imports and exports of agricultural produce.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the public, private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

Coming into force

The Secretary of State makes these Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972(1).
The Secretary of State is a Minister designated for the purposes of that section in relation to the common agricultural policy of the European Union(2), the environment(3), and measures in the veterinary and phytosanitary fields for the protection of public health(4).
(1)
1972 c. 68. Section 2(2) was amended by the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c. 51), section 27(1)(a) and the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 (c. 7), the Schedule, Part 1. It is prospectively repealed by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16), section 1 from exit day (see section 20 of that Act). Functions exercisable by the former Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State acting jointly were transferred to the Secretary of State by S.I. 2002/794. Under section 57(1) of the Scotland Act 1998 (c. 46), despite the transfer to Scottish Ministers of functions in relation to implementing obligations under EU law in relation to devolved matters, the Secretary of State retains power to exercise such functions as regards Scotland. Under paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 (c. 32), despite the transfer to the Welsh Ministers of functions in relation to implementing obligations under EU law in relation to devolved matters, the Secretary of State retains power to exercise such functions as regards Wales. The retained power of the Secretary of State to exercise such functions as regards Northern Ireland is confirmed by Article 2(3) of S.I. 1999/2027, Article 3(2) of S.I. 2000/2812 and Article 2(a) of S.I. 2008/301.

S.I. 1972/1811, which is prospectively revoked by S.I. 2018/1011 from exit day.

S.I. 2008/301, which is prospectively revoked by S.I. 2018/1011 from exit day.

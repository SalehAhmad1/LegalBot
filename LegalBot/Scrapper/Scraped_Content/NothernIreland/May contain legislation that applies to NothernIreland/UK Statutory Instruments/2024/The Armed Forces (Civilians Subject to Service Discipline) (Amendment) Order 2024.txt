7th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Under the Armed Forces Act 2006 (“the Act”) certain persons may, for the purposes of the Act, be “civilians subject to service discipline”. Whether a person is a civilian subject to service discipline depends in some cases partly on whether they are a member or employee of a specified organisation. Some categories of persons are civilians subject to service discipline when they are in a designated area. The Armed Forces (Civilians Subject to Service Discipline) Order 2009 (“the 2009 Order”) outlines the designated areas and the specified organisations for the purposes of the Act.
This Order amends the 2009 Order as follows. Article 3 amends Schedule 2 to the 2009 Order to remove “Service Children’s Education” and “the Services Sound and Vision Corporation” from the list of specified organisations. It also adds “BFBS” (known colloquially as the British Forces Broadcasting Service) as a specified organisation and it updates the organisational name of “the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association-Forces Help” to “Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association”.
Article 4(a) adds Estonia, the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal and the Kingdom of Bahrain to the list in Schedule 3 to the 2009 Order of the areas which are designated for the purposes of paragraphs 4, 6 and 9 of Schedule 15 to the Act and article 4(b) adds these areas to the list in Schedule 3 to the 2009 Order of areas which are designated for the purposes of paragraph 8 of Schedule 15 to the Act.
These amendments reflect changes to the designated areas adding Estonia, the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal and the Kingdom of Bahrain to the list in Schedule 3 to the 2009 Order as well as changes to organisational names listed in the 2009 Order.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

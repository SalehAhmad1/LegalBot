3.—(1) Where an eligible institution has an average liability base for a reference period that is up to and including £600 million, no amount of the levy is payable by that institution for the levy year to which that reference period relates.
(2) Where an eligible institution has an average liability base for a reference period that is above £600 million, the amount of the levy that the institution is liable to pay for the levy year to which that reference period relates is calculated by applying the following formula—
AL x EL/TEL.
(3) For the purposes of the formula in paragraph (2)—
(a)
“AL” is the amount of anticipated levy requirement for a levy year determined by the Bank in accordance with paragraph 4 of Schedule 2ZA (Bank of England levy) to the Act;
(b)
“EL” is the amount of the average liability base for the reference period in relation to that levy year that is over £600 million for that eligible institution;
(c)
“TEL” is the total sum of the average liability base for the reference period in relation to that levy year that is over £600 million for all eligible institutions that are liable to pay an amount of the levy under paragraph (2).
(4) When there is a new levy payer in a levy year, the Bank may do any of the following—
(a)
when determining the amount of “AL” in paragraph (3)(a) for the new levy payer—
(i)
disregard amounts that have been added to the anticipated levy requirement under paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 2ZA to the Act;
(ii)
disregard amounts of levy received in respect of a previous levy year that have been taken into account in the anticipated levy requirement under paragraph 4(4) of Schedule 2ZA to the Act;
(iii)
make any other adjustments as it thinks fit to amounts of the anticipated levy requirement that relate to a previous levy year to reduce the amount of levy payable by the new levy payer;
(b)
where the Bank is doing anything specified in sub-paragraph (a), make corresponding adjustments to the amount of levy payable by an eligible institution who is required to pay the levy but who is not a new levy payer using such method as the Bank thinks fit and may use different methods for different institutions.
(5) In this regulation—
(a)
the liability base of an eligible institution at any time is the aggregate of those sterling and foreign currency liabilities of the institution which are eligible liabilities;
(b)
a new levy payer is an eligible institution that is required to pay an amount of the levy under paragraph (2) in relation to a levy year, but that was not required to pay any levy in the previous levy year (irrespective of whether the eligible institution has paid a levy in any other levy year);
(c)
the reference period in relation to a levy year is—
(i)
the period beginning with 1st October and ending with 31st December for the year prior to the year in which the levy year begins, or
(ii)
where paragraph (6) applies, such other period of no more than three months as the Bank thinks fit.
(6) This paragraph applies where—
(a)
an eligible institution has not provided sufficient data for the period in paragraph (5)(c)(i) for the Bank to calculate the average liability base, or
(b)
a person has become an eligible institution during or after the period in paragraph (5)(c)(i).

5.—(1) The Treasury must—
(a)
review these Regulations, and
(b)
publish a report setting out the conclusions of the review.
(2) The first report must be published before the end of the period of five years beginning with 1st March 2024.Transitional provision for use of information
6.—(1) Paragraph (2) applies in relation to the determination by the Bank of the amount an eligible institution is liable to pay in respect of a levy year under paragraph 5 of Schedule 2ZA to the Act for the first year for which any such determination is made.

EUR 2013/575.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Schedule 2ZA to the Bank of England Act 1998 (c. 11) makes provision for the Bank of England to impose a charge, known as the Bank of England levy (“the levy”) on eligible institutions to fund its policy functions in relation to a levy year. An eligible institution is an “authorised deposit-taker” as defined in paragraph 2 of that Schedule. The policy functions that may be covered by the levy are set out in paragraph 4(3) of that Schedule and the levy year will be determined by the Bank under paragraph 3 of that Schedule.
The Bank will determine the total amount of levy it reasonably requires (“the anticipated levy requirement”) under paragraph 4 of that Schedule. Paragraph 5(1) requires the Bank to determine the amount of levy that an eligible institution is liable to pay in respect of a levy year in accordance with regulations made by the Treasury.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations make provision for which eligible institutions will be liable to pay the levy in respect of a levy year, and the proportion of the levy that each institution will pay be reference to their average eligible liability base. Where an eligible institution has an average eligible liability base up to and including £600 million for the relevant reference period that institution will not be required to pay any levy. Where an eligible institution has an average eligible liability base that exceeds £600 million for the relevant reference period, the amount of levy that is payable for that institution is calculated by applying the formula set out in these Regulations. Regulation 3(4) allows the Bank to make adjustments to the relevant costs for a levy year where there is a levy payer who has not paid a levy the previous year. Regulation 3(5) makes provision for the reference period and regulation 3(7) makes provision for calculating the average liability base.
An eligible institution’s liability base comprises those sterling and foreign currency liabilities of the institution which are eligible liabilities. Regulation 4 and the Schedule to these Regulations define eligible liabilities and make provision for the calculation of those liabilities.
Regulation 5 makes provision for a review of these Regulations and regulation 6 makes transitional provision for use of information.
A full regulatory assessment has not been produced for this instrument as the levy is outside of the scope of the Better Regulation Framework.

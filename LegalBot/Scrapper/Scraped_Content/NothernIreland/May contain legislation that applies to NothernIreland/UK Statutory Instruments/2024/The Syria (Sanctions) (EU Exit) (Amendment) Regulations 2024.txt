22nd May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 57 (exceptions relating to petroleum products) of the Syria (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/792) (the “original Regulations”).
Amongst other things, regulation 57 of the original Regulations creates an exception to a number of prohibitions for persons who receive funding from the Government of the United Kingdom for the purpose of providing a humanitarian assistance activity in Syria (“UK funded persons”). This applies where UK funded persons make funds or economic resources available for the purposes of purchasing, supplying or delivering petroleum products or for the purposes of providing funds, economic resources or financial services in relation to those activities, where the petroleum products are purchased, supplied or delivered exclusively for the purposes of providing a humanitarian assistance activity.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations:
extends the scope of the exception by including, in addition to “UK funded persons”, a number of others, such as the UN, international and non-governmental organisations and others involved in their delivery of humanitarian assistance activities, as well as those providing financial services, funds or economic resources to them;
replaces the existing notification requirement where the exception is relied upon with a requirement for those relying on the exception to notify the Treasury that they are involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance activity in Syria (subject to certain exceptions), and also makes some consequential amendments to other provisions in the original Regulations;
widens the scope of the exceptions contained in regulation 57 of the original Regulations so that they apply to the ‘acquisition’ of petroleum products rather than the ‘purchase’ of such products. This better aligns with the scope of the prohibition in regulation 37 (acquisition of military goods and technology, crude oil, and petroleum products) of the original Regulations;
amends the record keeping requirements with respect to trade licences to clarify that the specified information is required “where appropriate”.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen, and these Regulations are designed to reduce the burden on businesses, charities and other non-governmental organisations. An impact assessment was, however, produced for the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 and can be found at:

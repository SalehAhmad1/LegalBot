Regulation 1 provides for citation and commencement.
Regulation 2 amends regulation 8A of the 1981 Regulations so that paragraph (2) of regulation 8A applies where goods are subject to regulation 131(2) or 131F(3) of the Customs (Import Duty) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1248), and are not goods which were in Northern Ireland immediately before being removed to Great Britain by sea.

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of the North Sea adjacent to East 
Anglia, then a corridor via Royal Air Force Marham Norfolk, to Royal Air Force Cranwell and 
Royal Air Force Waddington Lincolnshire, where dispersal will occur, for flypast rehearsals for 
His Majesty the King’s Birthday Flypast that are due to take place there on 3rd June 2024 and 4th 
June 2024. 
As timings for the rehearsals are critical and the formation may not be able to take effective 
avoiding action, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Department for Transport agree that it is in 
the public interest that flying should be restricted in the vicinity of the relevant areas to avoid the 
risk that transient aircraft may disrupt the formation. 
These Regulations apply except insofar as flying is already prohibited by the Air Navigation 
(Restriction of Flying) (Nuclear Installations) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/1003), the Air 
Navigation (Restriction of Flying) (Scampton) (Restricted Zone EG R313) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 
2022/1221, amended by S.I. 2022/1320, S.I. 2023/234, S.I. 2023/852 and S.I. 2023/879), and the 
Air Navigation (Restriction of Flying) (Prisons and Young Offender Institutions) (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/1101). 
The times mentioned in regulation 3 are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST).

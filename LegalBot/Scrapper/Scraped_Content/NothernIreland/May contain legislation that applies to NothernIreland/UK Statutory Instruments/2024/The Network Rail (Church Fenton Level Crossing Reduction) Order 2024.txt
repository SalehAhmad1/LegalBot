(a)
the character of the highway and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;

the standard of maintenance appropriate for a highway of that character and used by such traffic;

where Network Rail could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the highway before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that Network Rail had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the highway to which the action relates unless it is also proved that Network Rail had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the highway and that the competent person had carried out those instructions.Construction of bridges

(8) If a person who receives an application for consent or approval fails to notify Network Rail of a decision within 28 days of receiving an application for consent under paragraph (3) or approval under paragraph (4)(a) that person is deemed to have granted consent or given approval, as the case may be.

(2) For section 5A(5A)(1) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 10 to the Network Rail (Church Fenton Level Crossing Reduction) Order 2024 (“the 2024 Order”);

(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.

with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.

(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act (as modified by article 19(7)) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—

5.  Without affecting any provision in this Order or anything shown on the deposited plans Network Rail must not acquire any apparatus other than by agreement.
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, Network Rail acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of an undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in question.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, Network Rail requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to the undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed.
(3) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the undertaker in question and Network Rail within 21 days of the service of a notice under sub-paragraph (2) or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(4) In any case where alternative apparatus is to be provided or constructed under sub-paragraph (2), or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus, Network Rail must, subject to sub-paragraph (5), afford to the undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of Network Rail and for the subsequent maintenance of that apparatus.
(5) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of Network Rail, or Network Rail is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (4) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from Network Rail, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(6) The undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration), and after the grant to the undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (4) or (5), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by Network Rail to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(7) Without affecting anything in sub-paragraph (6), if Network Rail gives notice in writing to the undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work to which this sub-paragraph applies, that work, instead of being executed by the undertaker, must be executed by Network Rail without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker.
(8) Sub-paragraph (7) applies to any part of any work necessary in connection with construction of alternative apparatus, or the removal of apparatus required to be removed, as will take place in any land of Network Rail.
(9) Nothing in sub-paragraph (7) authorises Network Rail to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, Network Rail affords to an undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of Network Rail of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Network Rail and the undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(2) In settling those terms and conditions in respect of the alternative apparatus to be constructed in or along any railway of Network Rail, the arbitrator must—
(a)
give effect to all reasonable requirements of Network Rail for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of the railway and for securing any subsequent alterations or adaptations of the alternative apparatus which may be required to prevent interference with any proposed works of Network Rail or the traffic on the railway; and
(b)
so far as it may be reasonable and practicable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case, give effect to the terms and conditions, if any, applicable to the apparatus constructed in or along the railway for which the alternative apparatus is to be substituted.
(3) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by Network Rail in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by Network Rail to that undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any of the authorised works that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2), Network Rail must submit to the undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works are to be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and an officer of the undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description are submitted to it under sub-paragraph (1).
(4) If an undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by Network Rail, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to Network Rail of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by Network Rail under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes Network Rail from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) Network Rail is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
9.  If in consequence of the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed Network Rail must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable the undertaker to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, Network Rail must repay to an undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by Network Rail or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
(6) Any dispute as to whether a financial benefit is conferred in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or as to the amount of such financial benefit which cannot be agreed is to be determined in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of an undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any undertaker, Network Rail must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on Network Rail with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of an undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) An undertaker must give Network Rail reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of Network Rail, which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
12.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provision of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Network Rail and an undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to Network Rail on the date on which this Order is made.

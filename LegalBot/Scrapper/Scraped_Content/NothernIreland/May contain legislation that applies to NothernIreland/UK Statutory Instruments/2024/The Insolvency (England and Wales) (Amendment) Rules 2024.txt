(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (S.I. 2016/1024). Rule 9.9 of those Rules lists property the official receiver must disregard for the purposes of determining the value of a person’s property in connection with a debt relief order. This includes a single domestic motor vehicle whose maximum potential realisable value is less than £2,000. These Rules change that amount to £4,000.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.
An Explanatory Memorandum has been prepared and is available alongside these Rules at www.legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health and Safety and Nuclear (Fees) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/1378) (“the 2022 Regulations”) to make various changes to the fees fixed by or determined under those Regulations.
In particular, these Regulations:
(a)
introduce new full cost recovery fee charging provisions for the following areas:
(i)
explosives, including acetylene safety (see regulations 4 and 6 which amend and restate regulation 9 and Schedule 7, respectively, in the 2022 Regulations) and dangerous goods in harbour areas (see regulations 7 and 8 which amend and restate regulation 11 and Schedule 8, respectively, in the 2022 Regulations);
(ii)
onshore oil, gas and geothermal well and borehole operations (see regulation 9 that inserts a new regulation 14A into the 2022 Regulations);
(iii)
pipelines conveying fluid under the Pipelines Safety Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/825) (see regulation 12 that inserts a new regulation 15A into the 2022 Regulations);
(iv)
onshore wind energy installations and offshore wind or marine energy installations (see regulation 12 that inserts new regulations 15B and 15C into the 2022 Regulations);
(b)
introduce fee increases for the fees that were fixed or determined by the 2022 Regulations (see regulations 3, 14 to 16, and the Schedule, as well as the Schedules replaced by regulations 6 and 8). The fees are raised by 5% from the level set out in the 2022 Regulations, as amended by the Health and Safety and Nuclear (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/247). The increase is in line with inflation or at a rate less than inflation (based on RPI for the 12-month period when the policy was determined, from September 2022 to September 2023).
These Regulations also make a miscellaneous amendment to the Gas Safety (Management) Regulations 1996 (S.I. 1996/551) (see regulation 17).
Guidance on the application of the new charging provisions in the relevant areas will be available on the charging website of the Health and Safety Executive(1) from the date this instrument comes into force.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

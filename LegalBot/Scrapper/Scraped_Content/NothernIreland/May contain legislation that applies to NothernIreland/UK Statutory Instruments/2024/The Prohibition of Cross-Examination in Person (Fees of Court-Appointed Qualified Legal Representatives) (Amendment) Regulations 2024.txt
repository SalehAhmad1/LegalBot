8th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Prohibition of Cross-Examination in Person (Fees of Court-Appointed Qualified Legal Representatives) Regulations 2022(1) (“the 2022 Regulations”) make provision for payment out of central funds of sums to cover the fees of court-appointed qualified legal representatives. These Regulations amend the 2022 Regulations to make provision in respect of terminated appointments and to increase the fixed fees payable under the scheme by 10%.
Regulation 2(2) introduces a new definition of ‘terminated appointment’ to refer to circumstances in which the court terminates the appointment of a qualified legal representative before a hearing. This may arise, for example, where the prohibited party subsequently arranges their own legal representation and the court-appointed qualified legal representative is no longer required.
Regulation 2(3) and (4) makes provision for the payment of fees and costs to a qualified legal representative whose appointment is terminated by the court before a hearing, where the qualified legal representative has undertaken preparatory work or has incurred costs in respect of the hearing that they have been unable to recover.
Regulation 2(5) to (9) applies a 10% increase (exclusive of VAT) to each of the fees specified in Tables 1 to 5 of the Schedule.
Regulation 3 makes transitional provision which provides that the increased fees may only be claimed in respect of hearings that take place or are cancelled after 31st May 2024.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

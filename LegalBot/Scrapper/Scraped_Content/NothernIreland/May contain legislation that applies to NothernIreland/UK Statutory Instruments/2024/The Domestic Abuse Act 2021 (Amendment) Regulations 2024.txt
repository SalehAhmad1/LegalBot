(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 (c. 17) to make an addition to the list of specified public authorities in section 15(3).
Regulation 2 adds the Independent Office for Police Conduct (‘the IOPC’) to the list of specified public authorities who can be requested to cooperate with the Domestic Abuse Commissioner (‘the Commissioner’) in any way that the Commissioner considers necessary for the purposes of the Commissioner’s functions (pursuant to section 15(1) of the Act). As a consequence, the IOPC will be required, so far as reasonably practicable, to comply with such a request. The IOPC is a body corporate established by section 9 of the Police Reform Act 2002 (c. 30).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

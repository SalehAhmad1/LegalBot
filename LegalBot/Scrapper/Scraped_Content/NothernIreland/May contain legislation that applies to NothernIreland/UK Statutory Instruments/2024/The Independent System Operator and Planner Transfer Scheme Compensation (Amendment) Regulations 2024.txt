These Regulations amend the Independent System Operator and Planner Transfer Scheme Compensation Regulations 2024 (S.I. 2024/125) (the “Compensation Regulations”), to correct an error in the commencement provision of the Compensation Regulations.

These Regulations specify when the Compensation Regulations will come into force, allowing a period between laying and commencement, as was intended.

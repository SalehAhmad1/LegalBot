1981 c. 22. The expression “the Ministers” is defined in section 86(1)(c). These powers, so far as exercisable by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales in relation to England, were transferred to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by S.I. 1999/3141 and were transferred to the Secretary of State by S.I. 2002/794. Section 87(4) of the Act provides that, subject to certain sections, the Act has effect in relation to poultry as it has effect in relation to animals. S.I. 2003/1078, made under (inter alia) section 87(5)(a), extended the definition of “poultry” to include all birds. Paragraphs 13 to 15 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16), which required the affirmative procedure, enhanced scrutiny procedure and explanatory statements for instruments which amend subordinate legislation made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 (c. 68), were repealed by section 10(1) of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (c. 28).Citation, commencement, extent and application.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order applies in relation to England only.
Article 2 extends the definition of “disease” in the Animal Health Act 1981 to include bluetongue.
Article 3 amends the Movement of Animals (Restrictions) (England) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/3229) to re-insert a provision allowing the Secretary of State to declare an area to be an infected area. It provides for the Order to be enforced by the local authority, except where otherwise stated or where the Secretary of State directs that the Order is to be enforced by the Secretary of State in relation to cases of a particular description or particular cases; and confers power, where such a direction is made, for the Secretary of State to delegate prosecution functions to the Director of Public Prosecutions.
Article 4 amends the Avian Influenza (Preventive Measures) England Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/2701). The requirement for a person who keeps poultry to notify the Secretary of State of certain information is amended to apply irrespective of the number of birds kept and is extended to apply also in relation to other captive birds. Additional information must be provided as part of the notification procedure by keepers of 50 or more poultry birds or other captive birds. The information must be updated online once every 12 months. The obligation to notify is subject to an exception in the case of keepers of Psittaciformes (such as budgerigars or parrots) or Passeriformes (such as canaries or finches) which are housed in dwellings or bird houses with no outdoor access.
Article 5 amends the Bluetongue Regulations 2008 (S.I. 2008/962) establishing further disease control measures applicable in the event of suspicion of bluetongue, including a power for a veterinary inspector to serve a notice prohibiting the movement of animals or germinal products onto or from suspect premises, except under the authority of a licence (which may be subject to conditions); power to declare a restriction zone where bluetongue is confirmed but not circulating; power to declare a bluetongue prevention zone as a precautionary measure where necessary to reduce the risk of an incursion of bluetongue virus into any part of England, and power to designate premises for the purposes of collecting, handling, processing or storing germinal products. Regulation 30, which required a review of the Regulations, is omitted.
No impact assessment has been produced as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

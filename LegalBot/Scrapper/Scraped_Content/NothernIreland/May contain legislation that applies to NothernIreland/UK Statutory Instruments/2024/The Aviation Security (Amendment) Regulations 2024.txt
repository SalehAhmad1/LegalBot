(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to legislation in the field of aviation security.
Regulation 2 amends Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1998 of 5 November 2015 laying down detailed measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security (“the Assimilated Regulation”). In particular, the amendments remove current requirements for cargo and mail carried by air, the screening of in-flight supplies and security equipment, as well as two provisions which cross-refer to those requirements.
Paragraph (4) of regulation 2 inserts definitions of LAGs and STEB into the Assimilated Regulation in appropriate positions, those definitions having been omitted by the removal of Chapter 8.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

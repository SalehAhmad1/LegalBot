(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules are made under section 83 of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and Care of Churches Measure 2018 (“the 2018 Measure”) and amend the Clergy Discipline Rules 2005 (S.I. 2005/2022) (“the 2005 Rules”).
Rule 2 amends rule 74 of the 2005 Rules so as to provide for the Archbishops’ List under section 38 of the 2018 Measure to be made available to suffragan bishops as well as to diocesan bishops.
Rule 3 amends rule 106 so as to expand the definition of each of “provincial registrar” and “registrar” to include a deputy registrar or other person appointed under section 29 or 31 of the 2018 Measure. It also makes a corrective amendment to the definition of “bishop” so as to remove the unnecessary reference to area bishops.

5th August 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make transitional provision in relation to the coming into force of the new building control regime for higher-risk buildings established by the Building Safety Act 2022. Under the new regime, registered building control approvers are unable to supervise higher-risk building work except in transitional cases where the initial notice was submitted before 1st October 2023 and the work was sufficiently progressed by 6th April 2024. These regulations ensure that amendment notices can be made in those transitional cases.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary sector or community bodies is foreseen.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make amendments to the Water Mergers (Modification of Enactments) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/3202) (“the 2004 Regulations”) that are consequential on amendments made by Schedule 6 to the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (c. 13) (“the DMCCA”). Schedule 6 to the DMCCA makes amendments to Part 3 of the Enterprise Act 2002 (c. 40) in relation to mergers involving energy network enterprises.
Part 3 of the Enterprise Act 2002 contains the main statutory scheme for the regulation of mergers. Sections 32 to 35 of, and Schedule 4ZA to, the Water Industry Act 1991 (c. 56) provide a separate scheme for the regulation of mergers between water or sewerage enterprises in England and Wales. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 4ZA provides that Part 3 of the Enterprise Act 2002 applies to water mergers with such modifications as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State. These modifications are set out in the 2004 Regulations.
These Regulations update the modifications made by the 2004 Regulations to sections 72, 73A to 75 and 79 in Part 3 of the Enterprise Act 2002 in consequence of the amendments to those sections made by Schedule 6 to the DMCCA.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

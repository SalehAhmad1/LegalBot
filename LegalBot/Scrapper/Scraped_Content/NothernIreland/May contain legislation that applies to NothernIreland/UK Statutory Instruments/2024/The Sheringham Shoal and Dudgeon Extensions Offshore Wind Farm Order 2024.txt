(4) For the purpose of carrying out protective works under this article to a building the undertaker may (subject to paragraphs (5) and (6))—
(a)
enter the building and any land within its curtilage; and
(b)
where the works cannot be carried out reasonably conveniently without entering land that is adjacent to the building but outside its curtilage, enter the adjacent land (but not any building erected on it).

(8) Where—
(a)
protective works are carried out under this article to a building; and
(b)
within the period of five years beginning with the day on which the part of the authorised project carried out in the vicinity of the building is brought into commercial operation it appears that the protective works are inadequate to protect the building against damage caused by the carrying out or use of that part of the authorised project;
the undertaker must compensate the owners and occupiers of the building for any loss or damage sustained by them.
(9) Nothing in this article relieves the undertaker of any liability to pay compensation under section 152 (compensation in case where no right to claim in nuisance) of the 2008 Act.
(10) Any compensation payable under paragraph (7) or (8) must be determined, in case of dispute, under Part 1 (determination of questions of disputed compensation) of the 1961 Act.
(11) Section 13 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act(1) applies to the entry onto land under this article to the same extent as it applies in respect of the compulsory acquisition of land under this Order by virtue of section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act.

PART 2
Approval of matters specified in requirements
Applications made under requirements
1.  Where an application has been made to the relevant authority (“the approving authority”) for any agreement or approval required pursuant to a requirement included in this Order, the approving authority must give notice to the undertaker of their decision, including the reasons, on the application, within a period of 56 days beginning with—
(a)
the day immediately following that on which the application is received by the approving authority;
(b)
where further information is requested under requirement 37, the day immediately following that on which the further information has been supplied by the undertaker; or
(c)
such longer period as may be agreed by the undertaker and the approving authority.
Further information
2.—(1) Where an application has been made under paragraph 1 the approving authority has the right to request such reasonable further information from the undertaker as is necessary to enable it to consider the application.
(2) If the approving authority considers further information is needed, and the requirement does not specify that consultation with a requirement consultee is required, it must, within 21 days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing specifying the further information required.
(3) If the requirement indicates that consultation must take place with a consultee the approving authority must issue the consultation to the requirement consultee within seven days of receipt of the application. Where the consultee requires further information they must notify the approving authority in writing specifying the further information required within 21 days of receipt of the consultation. The approving authority must notify the undertaker in writing specifying any further information requested by the consultee within seven days of receipt of such a request.
(4) In the event that the approving authority does not give such notification as specified in sub- paragraphs (2) or (3) it is deemed to have sufficient information to consider the application and is not thereafter entitled to request further information without the prior agreement of the undertaker.
(5) An approving authority may request further information under sub-paragraph (1) on more than one occasion provided that all such requests are made within the period specified in sub- paragraphs (2) and (3).
Provision of information by Consultees
3.—(1) Any consultee who receives a consultation under sub-paragraph 2(3) must respond to that request within 28 days from receipt unless either sub-paragraph (2) of this paragraph applies or a longer period is agreed with both the undertaker and the approving authority.
(2) Where any consultee requests further information in accordance with the timescales set out in sub-paragraph 2(3) then they must respond to the consultation within 14 days from the receipt of the further information requested unless a longer period is agreed with both the undertaker and the approving authority.
Fees
4.—(1) Where an application is made to the approving authority for agreement or approval in respect of a requirement the fee for the discharge of conditions as specified in the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and Site Visits) (England) Regulations 2012(2) (or any regulations replacing the same) is to be paid by the undertaker to the approving authority in accordance with these regulations.
(2) Any fee paid under this Schedule must be refunded to the undertaker within four weeks of the application being rejected as invalidly made.
Appeal
5.—(1) The undertaker may appeal to the Secretary of State in the event that—
(a)
the approving authority refuses an application for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order or grants it subject to conditions;
(b)
the approving authority does not give notice of its decision to the undertaker within the time period specified in paragraph 1;
(c)
on receipt of a request for further information under paragraph 2 the undertaker considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the approving authority is not necessary for the consideration of the application; or
(d)
on receipt of any further information requested, the approving authority notifies the undertaker that the information provided is inadequate and requests additional information which the undertaker considers is not necessary for the consideration of the application.
(2) The appeal process is to be as follows—
(a)
any appeal by the undertaker must be made within 42 days of the notice of the decision or determination, or (where no determination has been made) the expiry of the time period set out in paragraph 36(1), giving rise to the appeal referred to in sub-paragraph (1);
(b)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the requirement which is the subject of the appeal (together with the undertaker, these are the “appeal parties”);
(c)
as soon as is practicable after receiving the appeal documentation, the Secretary of State must appoint a person (the “appointed person”) to determine the appeal and must notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for their attention should be sent, the date of such notification being the “start date” for the purposes of this sub-paragraph (2);
(d)
the relevant planning authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the requirement which is the subject of the appeal must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within 21 days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(e)
the appeal parties must make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within 21 days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph (2)(d); and
(f)
the appointed person must make their decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 42 days of the later of—
(i)
the deadline for receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph (2)(d); or
(ii)
the deadline for the receipt of counter-submissions pursuant to sub-paragraph (2)(e).
(3) The appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (2)(c) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(4) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to consider the appeal, the appointed person must notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required and the date by which the information is to be submitted and the appointed person must make any notification and set the date for the receipt of such further information having regard to the timescales in sub-paragraph (2).
(5) Any further information required under sub-paragraph (4) must be provided by the appeal party from whom the further information was requested to the appointed person and other appeal parties, the relevant planning authority and any consultee required to be consulted pursuant to the requirement the subject of the appeal on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the appointed person within 12 days of the specified date but otherwise is to be in accordance with the process and time limits set out in sub-paragraphs (2)(d) to (2)(f).
(6) On an appeal under this sub-paragraph, the appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal; or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant planning authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not).
(7) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits.
(8) The appointed person may proceed to a decision even though no written representations have been made within the relevant time limits, if it appears to the appointed person that there is sufficient material to enable a decision to be made on the merits of the case and may deal with the application as if it had been made to the appointed person in the first instance.
(9) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, and a court may entertain proceedings for questioning the decision only if the proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(10) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this article, it is to be deemed to be an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 as if it had been given by the approving authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.
(11) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (12) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(12) On application by the approving authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to Planning Practice Guidance: Appeals (March 2014) or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

Modification of compensation and compulsory purchase enactments for creation of new rights and imposition of restrictive covenants
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or the imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation for the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (as modified by paragraph (5(5) of Schedule 8 (modification of compensation and compulsory purchase enactments for creation of new rights and imposition of restrictive covenants) to the Dudgeon and Sheringham Shoal Extensions Offshore Wind Farm Development Consent Order 2024 (the “2024 Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 8 (modification of compensation and compulsory purchase enactments for creation of new rights and imposition of restrictive covenants) to the 2024 Order) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph 2(2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 23 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 17 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant, under article 19 (compulsory acquisition of rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (refusal to convey, failure to make title, etc.);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (conveyance of the land or interest);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11 (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 17), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant (which is deemed for this purpose to have been created on the date of service of the notice); and sections 11A (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12 (unauthorised entry) and 13 (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference
with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 23(4) is modified so as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or enforce the restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND NOT IN NOTICE TO TREAT
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or a restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and has not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 as applied by article 22 (application of the 1981 Act) of the Dudgeon and Sheringham Shoal Extensions Offshore Wind Farm Development Consent Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 23(4) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the Dudgeon and Sheringham Shoal Extensions Offshore Wind Farm Development Consent Order 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
(3) In this Schedule “house”, except in paragraph 10, includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decide to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority do not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serve notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawing of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”

(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the affected undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the affected undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration).
(5) The affected undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration), and after the grant to the affected undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the affected undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the affected undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the affected undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
6.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part, the undertaker affords to an affected undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the affected undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the affected undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that affected undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
7.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works of the type referred to in sub-paragraph 5(2) that are required within 15 metres, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph 5(2) the undertaker must submit to the affected undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the affected undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the affected undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) are to be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If an affected undertaker, in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, the provisions of this Part apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 5(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the affected undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses and costs
8.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to an affected undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that affected undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus (including costs or compensation payable in connection with the acquisition of land for that purpose) which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in sub-paragraph 5(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated;
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration) to be necessary then, if such placing involves cost exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the affected undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to an affected undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the affected undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
9.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraph 5(2) any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that affected undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that affected undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker;
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) An affected undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker and, if such consent is withheld, the undertaker has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signallers, watch-persons and other persons whom it shall be reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer, require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or from the substitution or diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work.

(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 5(1) for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 5(1)) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 5(1) has effect subject to the sub-paragraph.
(6) Prior to the commencement of operation of the authorised development the undertaker shall test the use of the authorised development in a manner that shall first have been agreed with National Rail, and if, notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing of the authorised development causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;

(10) For the purpose of paragraph 10(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph shall be deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
(11) In relation to any dispute arising under this paragraph the reference in article 42 (arbitration) to the Secretary of State shall be read as a reference to the Institution of Engineering and Technology.
12.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as to not adversely affect railway property.
13.

Protective works to buildings
5.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 15 (protective work to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of National Gas Transmission.
Acquisition of land
6.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker must not (a) appropriate or acquire or take temporary possession of any land or apparatus or (b) appropriate, acquire, extinguish, interfere with or override any easement, other interest or right or apparatus of National Gas Transmission otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised development (or in such timeframe as otherwise agreed between National Gas Transmission and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of National Gas Transmission or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Gas Transmission and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Gas Transmission reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as are agreed between National Gas Transmission and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Gas Transmission unless otherwise agreed by National Gas Transmission, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure or secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised development.
(3) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Gas Transmission and the undertaker, the undertaker and National Gas Transmission agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Gas Transmission or other enactments relied upon by National Gas Transmission as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Part of this Schedule shall prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Gas Transmission under paragraph 9 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, shall not be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Gas Transmission to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Gas Transmission in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Gas Transmission advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Gas Transmission reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), secure any necessary consents for the alternative apparatus and afford to National Gas Transmission to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 8(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Gas Transmission may in its sole discretion, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for National Gas Transmission to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Gas Transmission and the undertaker.
(5) National Gas Transmission must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to a written diversion agreement having been entered into between the parties and the grant to National Gas Transmission of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Gas Transmission facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as agreed between the undertaker and National Gas Transmission and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Gas Transmission than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Gas Transmission.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Gas Transmission than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject the matter can be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Gas Transmission as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection
9.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to National Gas Transmission a plan and, if reasonably required by National Gas Transmission, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) In relation to specified works, the plan to be submitted to National Gas Transmission under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply until National Gas Transmission has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of National Gas Transmission required under sub-paragraph (2)—
(a)
can be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (4) or (6); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (1) or (2) apply, National Gas Transmission Gas can require such modifications to be made to the plans as reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works executed under sub-paragraphs (1) or (2) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub paragraph (4), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Gas Transmission and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub- paragraphs (4) or (6) by National Gas Transmission for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Gas Transmission will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where National Gas Transmission requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Gas Transmission’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and National Gas Transmission must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(8) If National Gas Transmission in accordance with sub-paragraphs (4) or (6) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National Gas Transmission notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and comply with sub paragraph (10) at all times.
(11) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order the undertaker must comply with National Gas Transmission’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “Specification for safe working in the vicinity of National Gas Transmission, High pressure Gas pipelines and associated installation requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW/22” and HSE’s “HS(~G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
(12) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that National Gas Transmission retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 10.
Expenses
10.—(1) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Gas Transmission and the undertaker and subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Gas Transmission within 30 days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim from National Gas Transmission all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Gas Transmission in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which are required in consequence of the execution of any authorised development including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Gas Transmission in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Gas Transmission as a consequence of National Gas Transmission—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 7(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Gas Transmission;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as is the case, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 15 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as is the case, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Gas Transmission by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs must be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Gas Transmission in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Gas Transmission any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of National Gas Transmission, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Gas Transmission, or National Gas Transmission becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from National Gas Transmission the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Gas Transmission in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Gas Transmission for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Gas Transmission, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Gas Transmission becoming liable to any third party and including Network Code Claims other than arising from any default of National Gas Transmission.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Gas Transmission on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Gas Transmission or in accordance with any requirement of National Gas Transmission or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless National Gas Transmission fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Gas Transmission, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any authorised development or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by National Gas Transmission as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 5 (benefit of Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised development yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph (3)(b) are to be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 11; or
(c)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working or business interruption) arising from any such damage or interruption, which is not reasonably foreseeable.
(4) National Gas Transmission must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third- party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) National Gas Transmission must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) National Gas Transmission must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within National Gas Transmission’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Gas Transmission’s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker National Gas Transmission must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
Enactments and agreements
12.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between National Gas Transmission and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Gas Transmission in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
13.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or National Gas Transmission requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 7(2) or National Gas Transmission makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 9, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Gas Transmission’s undertaking and National Gas Transmission Gas must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever National Gas Transmission’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
14.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 6(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as required to enable National Gas Transmission to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
15.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 7(2), 7(4) and 8(1) any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Gas Transmission under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Gas Transmission, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration).

4.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under the Order, if National Grid has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street National Grid has the same rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the closure and the undertaker must grant to National Grid, or procure the granting to National Grid of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to National Grid in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the closure of any such street or highway but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or National Grid to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 7 or the power of the undertaker, subject to compliance with this sub-paragraph, to carry out works under paragraph 9.
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under the powers of article 10 (temporary closure of streets), National Grid is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such closed highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the closure or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
5.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 15 (protective work to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of National Grid.
Acquisition of land
6.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker must not (a) appropriate or acquire or take temporary possession of any land or apparatus or (b) appropriate, acquire, extinguish, interfere with or override any easement, other interest or right or apparatus of National Grid otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised development (or in such timeframe as otherwise agreed between National Grid and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of National Grid or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Grid and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Grid reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as are agreed between National Grid and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid unless otherwise agreed by National Grid , and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure or secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised development.
(3) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid or other enactments relied upon by National Grid as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Part of this Schedule shall prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 9 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, shall not be taken to constitute agreement under sub- paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid in accordance with sub- paragraph (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), secure any necessary consents for the alternative apparatus and afford to National Grid to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 8(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation shall not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker.
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to a written diversion agreement having been entered into between the parties and the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Grid facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Grid .
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 15 (Arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection
9.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan of the works to be executed and seek from National Grid details of the underground extent of their electricity assets.
(2) In relation to works which are to be situated on, over, under or within (i) 15 metres measured in any direction of any apparatus, or (ii) involve embankment works within 15 metres of any apparatus, the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)

(3) In relation to any works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres of any part of the foundations of an electricity tower or between any two or more electricity towers, the plan to be submitted under sub-paragraph (1) must, in addition to the matters set out in sub- paragraph (2), include a method statement describing—
(a)
details of any cable trench design including route, dimensions and clearance to pylon foundations;
(b)
demonstration that pylon foundations will not be affected prior to, during and post construction;
(c)
details of load bearing capacities of trenches;
(d)
details of any cable installation methodology including access arrangements, jointing bays and backfill methodology;
(e)
a written management plan for high voltage hazard during construction and ongoing maintenance of any cable route;

(4) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) apply until National Grid has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(5) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
can be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub- paragraphs (6) or (8); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) apply, National Grid can require such modifications to be made to the plans as reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works executed under sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (6), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs or (8) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where National Grid requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised development (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required and National Grid must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised development, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub- paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and comply with sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order, the undertaker must comply with National Grid’s policies for development near overhead lines EN43-8 and HSE’s guidance note 6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Lines”.
Expenses
10.—(1) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Grid and the undertaker and subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid within 30 days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim from National Grid all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which are required in consequence of the execution of any authorised development including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid;
(b)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 7(3); or
(c)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(d)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(e)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(f)
the approval of plans;
(g)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 15 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from National Grid the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid , by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any third party and including STC Claims or an Incentive Deduction other than arising from any default of National Grid .
(2) The fact that any act or thing has been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid or under its supervision does not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless National Grid fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid , its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any authorised development or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by National Grid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 5 (benefit of Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised development yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section (3)(b) are to be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 11; or
(c)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working or business interruption) arising from any such damage or interruption, which is not reasonably foreseeable.
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third-party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) National Grid must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within National Grid’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Grid ‘s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker National Grid must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
Enactments and agreements
12.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between National Grid and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
13.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or National Grid requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 7(2) or National Grid makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 9, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Grid’s undertaking and National Grid must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever National Grid’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
14.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 6(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as required to enable National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
15.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 7(2), 7(4) and 8(1) any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Grid under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 43 (arbitration).
Notices
16.  Notwithstanding article 41 (service of notices), any plans submitted to National Grid by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 9 must be submitted to https://lsbud.co.uk/ or such other address as National Grid may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker in writing.

(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Cadent advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Cadent reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to Cadent to its satisfaction (taking into account sub-paragraph 8(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus);
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus); and
(c)
to allow access to that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus).
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub- paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent may, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation will not extend to the requirement for Cadent to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub- paragraph (2) or (3) have been afforded to Cadent to its satisfaction, then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed (in Cadent’s opinion) then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 15 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator will make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of Cadent
9.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to Cadent a plan and, if reasonably required by Cadent, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc.;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) apply until Cadent has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) Any approval of Cadent required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub- paragraphs (5) or (7); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (1) or (2) apply, Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and (2) or as relevant sub-paragraph (4), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent and in accordance with all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and Cadent will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If Cadent, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph 7(2).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorized works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with—
(a)
the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(11) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order the undertaker must comply with the Cadent’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “CD/SP/SSW/22 Cadent’s policies for safe working in the vicinity of Cadent’s Assets” and HSE’s “HS(~G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
(12) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development the undertaker will implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 10.
Expenses
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Cadent on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by Cadent in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by Cadent in connection with the negotiation or acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including professional fees) incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 7(3) if it elects to do so; or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule;
(g)
any watching brief pursuant to paragraph 9(6).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible or appropriate in the circumstances (including due to statutory or regulatory changes) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Cadent becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) will impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any authorised works or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by Cadent as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 5 (benefit of order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-section 3(b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 11.
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third-party claim or demand and no settlement or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations. Enactments and agreements.
Enactments and agreements
12.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between Cadent and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule will affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Cadent in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
13.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised works, the undertaker or Cadent requires the removal of apparatus under sub-paragraph 7(2) or Cadent makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 9, the undertaker will use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Cadent’s undertaking and Cadent will use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever Cadent’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
14.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 6(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus) is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable Cadent to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
15.  Save for differences or disputes arising under sub-paragraphs 7(2), 7(4), 8(1), 11(5) and paragraph 9 any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and Cadent under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Cadent, be determined by be referred to and settled by a single arbitrator to be agreed between the parties, or failing agreement, to be appointed on the application of either party (after giving notice in writing to the other) to the President of the Institute of Civil Engineers and in settling any difference or dispute, the arbitrator must have regard to the requirements of Cadent for ensuring the safety, economic and efficient operation of Cadent’s apparatus.
Notices
16.

Apparatus in closed streets
3.  Regardless of the temporary closure or diversion of any highway under the powers conferred by article 10 (temporary closure of streets), Anglian Water is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such closed highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the closure or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
4.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 15 (protective work to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
Acquisition of land
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that Anglian Water’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of Anglian Water to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished, until—
(a)
alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (8); and
(b)
facilities and rights have been secured for that alternative apparatus in accordance with paragraph 7.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to Anglian Water 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Anglian Water the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed Anglian Water must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Anglian Water and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration).
(5) Anglian Water must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 42, and after the grant to Anglian Water of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if Anglian Water gives notice in writing to the undertaker that it desires the undertaker to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker or to the extent that Anglian Water fails to proceed with that work in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or the undertaker and Anglian Water otherwise agree, that work, instead of being executed by Anglian Water, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water.
(7) If Anglian Water fails either reasonably to approve, or to provide reasons for its failure to approve along with an indication of what would be required to make acceptable, any proposed details relating to required removal works under sub-paragraph (2) within 28 days of receiving a notice of the required works from the undertaker, then such details are deemed to have been approved. For the avoidance of doubt, any such “deemed consent” does not extend to the actual undertaking of the removal works, which shall remain the sole responsibility of Anglian Water or its contractors.
(8) Whenever alternative apparatus is to be or is being substituted for existing apparatus, the undertaker shall, before taking or requiring any further step in such substitution works, use best endeavours to comply with Anglian Water’s reasonable requests for a reasonable period of time to enable Anglian Water to—
(a)
make network contingency arrangements; or
(b)
bring such matters as it may consider reasonably necessary to the attention of end users of the utility in question.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to Anglian Water facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Anglian Water or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Anglian Water than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Anglian Water as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
(3) Such facilities and rights as are set out in this paragraph are deemed to include any statutory permits granted to the undertaker in respect of the apparatus in question, whether under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 or other legislation.
Retained apparatus
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus (or any means of access to it) the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2), the undertaker must submit to Anglian Water a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub- paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Anglian Water for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Anglian Water is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Anglian Water under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) Any approval of Anglian Water must—
(a)
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
(b)
in the case of a refusal must be accompanied by a statement of grounds for refusal;
(c)
is deemed to have been approved if it is neither given or refused within 28 days of the submission of the relevant information.
(5) If Anglian Water in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) and (6) to (8) of paragraph 6 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2).
(6) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(7) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give to Anglian Water notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances, using its best endeavours to keep the impact of those emergency works on Anglian Water’s apparatus, on the operation of its water and sewerage network and on end-users of the services Anglian Water provides to a minimum.
(8) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) and without prejudice to the generality of the principles set out in that sub-paragraph, works are deemed to be in land near Anglian Water’s apparatus (where it is a pipe) if those works fall within the following distances measured from the medial line of such apparatus—
(a)
4 metres where the diameter of the pipe is less than 250 millimetres;
(b)
5 metres where the diameter of the pipe is between 250 and 400 millimetres, and
(c)
a distance to be agreed on a case-by-case basis and before the submission of the plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted where the diameter of the pipe exceeds 400 millimetres.
Expenses and costs
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Anglian Water all expenses reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Anglian Water by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 4 or 6(2), or by reason of any subsidence resulting from such development or works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Anglian Water, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Anglian Water, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Anglian Water for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by Anglian Water;
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Anglian Water on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Anglian Water or in accordance with any requirement of Anglian Water or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Anglian Water fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and professional like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Anglian Water, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
11.  Anglian Water must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made, without the consent of the undertaker (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
Cooperation
12.  Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, the undertaker or Anglian Water requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 6(2) or Anglian Water makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 8(3), the undertaker must use all reasonable endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Anglian Water’s undertaking, using existing processes where requested by Anglian Water, provided it is appropriate to do so, and Anglian Water must use all reasonable endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
13.  Where the undertaker identifies any apparatus which may belong to or be maintainable by Anglian Water but which does not appear on any statutory map kept for the purpose by Anglian Water, it shall inform Anglian Water of the existence and location of the apparatus as soon as reasonably practicable.
14.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Anglian Water in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
15.  The undertaker and Anglian Water may by written agreement substitute any period of time for those periods set out in this Part of this Schedule.
16.  For the avoidance of doubt whenever Anglian Water’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
17.  Any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and Anglian Water under this Part must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Anglian Water, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration).

PART 12
For the protection of Eastern Power Networks Plc
Application
1.  For the protection of the persons referred to in this part of this Schedule the following provisions will, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the person concerned, have effect.

“apparatus” means in respect of the various protected persons means electric lines or electrical plant as defined in the Electricity Act 1989, belonging to or maintained by that protected person;
“commence” has the same meaning as in article 2 but for the purposes of this Part of Schedule 14 any works whatsoever which are near to or may affect apparatus of the protected person will be included within this definition and for the avoidance of doubt this includes works for the diversion or laying of services;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in”, in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over, across, along or upon such land;
“maintain” and “maintenance” will include the ability and right to do any of the following in relation to any apparatus or alternative apparatus of the protected person including construct, use, repair, alter, inspect, renew or remove the apparatus;

“protected person” means any licence holder within the meaning of Part 1 of the Electricity Act 1989.
3.  Except for paragraph 4 (apparatus in closed streets), and 9 (retained apparatus: protection), this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the protected person are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act (as if this Order did not apply).
Apparatus of Protected Persons in closed streets
4.  Notwithstanding the temporary stopping up or diversion of any highway under the powers of article 10 (temporary closure of streets), or otherwise under this Order, a protected person will be at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such closed highway or to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the closure or diversion was in that highway subject always to the undertaking of works by the undertaker authorised by this Order.
Protective works to buildings
5.—(1) The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by this Order will so exercise those powers as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of the protected person and, if by reason of the exercise of those powers any damage to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal or abandonment) or property of any protected person or any interruption in the supply of electricity, gas or water, as the case may be, by the protected person is caused, the undertaker will bear and pay on demand the cost reasonably incurred by that protected person in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and, subject to sub-paragraph (2), will—
(a)
make compensation to the undertaker for any loss sustained by it; and
(b)
reimburse the protected person against all reasonably made claims, demands, proceedings, costs, damages and expenses which may be made or taken against or recovered from or incurred by that protected person, by reason of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in this paragraph will impose any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that such damage or interruption is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a protected person or its contractors or workmen; and the protected person will give to the undertaker reasonable notice of any claim or demand as aforesaid and no settlement or compromise thereof will be made without first consulting the undertaker and giving it an opportunity to make representations as to the claim or demand.
Acquisition of land
6.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference, the undertaker will not acquire any apparatus or override any easement or other interest of a protected person or acquire any land or other interest of a protected person or create any new rights over the same otherwise than by agreement of the protected person, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 6 or in any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus will not be removed under this part of this Schedule and any right of a protected person to maintain that apparatus in that land will not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the protected person in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it will give to the protected person in question 56 days’ advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a protected person reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker will, subject to sub‑paragraph (3), afford to the protected person to their satisfaction (taking into account sub-paragraph 8(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights for—
(a)
the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the protective person in question will, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation will not extend to the requirement for the protected person to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this part of this Schedule will be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the protected person in question and the undertaker both acting reasonably.
(5) The protected person in question will, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the grant to the protected person of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a protected person facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights will be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the protected person in question and will be no less favourable on the whole to the protected person in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless agreed by the protected person.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with the protected person under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to the protected person in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter will be referred to arbitration and, the arbitrator will make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that protected person as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: Protection
9.—(1) Not less than 56 days before commencing the execution of any works authorised by this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph 7(2) or otherwise, the undertaker will submit to the protected person in question a plan.
(2) In relation to any works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 15 metres measured in any direction of any apparatus, or involve embankment works within 15 metres of any apparatus, the plan to be submitted to the protected person under sub-paragraph (1) will be detailed including a material statement and describing—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant;
(d)
the position of all apparatus; and
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus;
(f)
proposed mitigation required.
(3) The undertaker will not commence the construction or renewal of any works to which sub- paragraph (2) applies until the protected person has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(4) The protected person may require as a condition of their consent the undertaker to enter into an asset protection agreement in a form which is reasonably required by the protected person to ensure that the undertaker provides enough mitigation for the works.
(5) Any approval of the protected person required under sub-paragraph (2)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub- paragraphs (5) or (7);
(b)
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
(c)
will be deemed to be granted 14 days after the expiry of the 56 day period if no response to the request for approval has been provided within that initial 56 day period.
(6) In relation to a work to which sub-paragraph (2) applies, the protected person may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its system against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works executed under this Order will be executed only in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (4), as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and the protected person and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) or (7) by the protected person for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the protected person will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where any protected person requires any protective works to be carried out either by the protected person itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works will be carried out to the protected person’s reasonable satisfaction prior to the carrying out of any works authorised by the Order (or any relevant part thereof) and the protected person in question will give 56 days’ notice of such works from the date of approval of a plan submitted in line with sub-paragraphs (1) or (4) (except in an emergency).
(9) If a protected person in accordance with sub-paragraphs (5) or (7) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 will apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under sub-paragraph 7(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph will preclude the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case will the execution of any works commence until 56 days have lapsed following submission of any new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan; and
(11) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it will give to the protected person in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and will comply with sub-paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
Expenses
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker will repay to a protected person on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably incurred by that protected person in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred or compensation properly paid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation in the event that the protected person elects to use compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under sub-paragraph 7(3) all costs incurred as a result of such action;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 42 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the protected person in question by virtue of sub- paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of operations, capacity, dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)

by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption; and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by the protected person on behalf the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the protected person or in accordance with any requirement of the protected person or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (2), excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this paragraph.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a protected person, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.

(2) The Parties will first use their reasonable endeavours to settle a dispute amicably through negotiations undertaken in good faith by the senior management of the Parties. Any dispute which is not resolved amicably by the senior management of the Parties within 20 business days of the dispute arising, or such longer period as agreed in writing by the Parties, shall be subject to arbitration in accordance with the terms of this Schedule.
(3) The Arbitration is deemed to have commenced when a party (“the Claimant”) serves a written notice of arbitration on the other party (“the Respondent”).
Time periods
2.—(1) All time periods in these Arbitration Rules are measured in days and include weekends, but not bank or public holidays.
(2) Time periods are calculated from the day after the Arbitrator is appointed which is either—

(b)
the date the Arbitrator is appointed by the Secretary of State.
Timetable
3.—(1) The timetable for the Arbitration is set out in sub–paragraphs (2) to (4) below unless amended in accordance with paragraph 5(3).
(2) Within 14 days of the Arbitrator being appointed, the Claimant must provide both the Respondent and the Arbitrator with—

a written Statement of Claim which describes the nature of the difference between the parties, the legal and factual issues, the Claimant’s contentions as to those issues, the amount of its claim and/or the remedy it is seeking; and
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of all documents on which it relies, including contractual documentation, correspondence (including electronic documents), legal precedents and expert witness reports.
(3) Within 14 days of receipt of the Claimant’s statements under sub–paragraph (2) by the Arbitrator and Respondent, the Respondent must provide the Claimant and the Arbitrator with—
(a)
a written Statement of Defence responding to the Claimant’s Statement of Claim, its statement in respect of the nature of the difference, the legal and factual issues in the Claimant’s claim, its acceptance of any element(s) of the Claimant’s claim, its contentions as to those elements of the Claimant’s claim it does not accept;

Procedure
4.—(1) The parties’ pleadings, witness statements and expert reports (if any) must be concise. No single pleading is to exceed 30 single-sided A4 pages using 10pt Arial font.
(2) The Arbitrator must make an award on the substantive difference(s) based solely on the written material submitted by the parties unless the Arbitrator decides that a hearing is necessary to explain or resolve any matters.
(3) Either party may, within 2 days of delivery of the last submission, request a hearing giving specific reasons why it considers a hearing is required.
(4) Within 7 days of receiving the last submission, the Arbitrator must notify the parties whether a hearing is to be held and the length of that hearing.
(5) Within 10 days of the Arbitrator advising the parties that he is to hold a hearing, the date and venue for the hearing must be fixed by agreement with the parties, save that if there is no agreement the Arbitrator must direct a date and venue which he considers is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. The date for the hearing must not be less than 35 days from the date of the Arbitrator’s direction confirming the date and venue of the hearing.
(6) A decision must be made by the Arbitrator on whether there is any need for expert evidence to be submitted orally at the hearing. If oral expert evidence is required by the Arbitrator, then any expert(s) attending the hearing may be asked questions by the Arbitrator.
(7) There is no process of examination and cross-examination of experts, but the Arbitrator must invite the parties to ask questions of the experts by way of clarification of any answers given by the expert(s) in response to the Arbitrator’s questions. Prior to the hearing the procedure for the expert(s) is—
(a)
at least 28 days before a hearing, the Arbitrator must provide a list of issues to be addressed by the expert(s);
(b)
if more than one expert is called, they are to jointly confer and produce a joint report or reports within 14 days of the issues being provided; and
(c)
the form and content of a joint report must be as directed by the Arbitrator and must be provided at least 7 days before the hearing.
(8) Within 14 days of a Hearing or a decision by the Arbitrator that no hearing is to be held the Parties may by way of exchange provide the Arbitrator with a final submission in connection with the matters in dispute and any submissions on costs. The Arbitrator must take these submissions into account in the Award.
(9) The Arbitrator may make other directions or rulings as considered appropriate in order to ensure that the parties comply with the timetable and procedures to achieve an award on the substantive difference within four months of the date on which they are appointed, unless both parties otherwise agree to an extension to the date for the award.
(10) If a party fails to comply with the timetable, procedure or any other direction then the Arbitrator may continue in the absence of a party or submission or document, and may make a decision on the information before them attaching the appropriate weight to any evidence submitted beyond any timetable or in breach of any procedure and/or direction.
(11) The Arbitrator’s award must include reasons. The parties must accept that the extent to which reasons are given are proportionate to the issues in dispute and the time available to the Arbitrator to deliver the award.
Arbitrator’s powers
5.—(1) The Arbitrator has all the powers of the Arbitration Act 1996(1), including the non-mandatory sections, save where modified by these Rules.
(2) There must be no discovery or disclosure, except that the Arbitrator has the power to order the parties to produce such documents as are reasonably requested by another party no later than the Statement of Reply, or by the Arbitrator, where the documents are manifestly relevant, specifically identified and the burden of production is not excessive. Any application and orders are to be made by way of a Redfern Schedule without any hearing.
(3) Any time limits fixed in accordance with this procedure or by the Arbitrator may be varied by agreement between the parties, subject to any such variation being acceptable to and approved by the Arbitrator. In the absence of agreement, the Arbitrator may vary the timescales and/or procedure—
(a)
if the Arbitrator is satisfied that a variation of any fixed time limit is reasonably necessary to avoid a breach of the rules of natural justice; and then
(b)
only for such a period that is necessary to achieve fairness between the parties.
(4) On the date the award is made, the Arbitrator must notify the parties that the award is completed, signed and dated, and that it is to be issued to the parties on receipt of cleared funds for the Arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
Costs
6.—(1) The costs of the Arbitration must include the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator, the reasonable fees and expenses of any experts and the reasonable legal and other costs incurred by the parties for the Arbitration.
(2) Where the difference involves connected/interrelated issues, the Arbitrator must consider the relevant costs collectively.
(3) The final award must fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties must bear them or in what proportion they are to be borne by the parties.
(4) The Arbitrator must award recoverable costs on the general principle that costs follow the event, having regard to all material circumstances, including such matters as exaggerated claims and/or defences, the degree of success for different elements of the claims, claims that have incurred substantial costs, the conduct of the parties and the degree of success of a party.
Confidentiality
7.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (4), any arbitration hearing and documentation shall be open to and accessible by the public.
(2) Where the Arbitration relates to a dispute or difference under the provisions of Schedule 17, the hearings must take place in private unless otherwise agreed between the parties and any matters, materials, documents, awards, expert reports and the like are confidential and must not be disclosed to any third party without prior written consent of the other party.
(3) The Arbitrator may direct that the whole or part of a hearing is to be private and/or any documentation to be confidential where it is necessary in order to protect commercially sensitive information.
(4) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent any disclosure of a document by a party pursuant to an order of a court in England and Wales or where disclosure is required under any enactment.

The Tables in Schedules 1 to 5 to this Order replace tables in Schedules 1 and 2 to the principal Order, in order to adjust the rates prescribed for retired pay, pensions, gratuities and allowances in respect of disablement or death due to service in the armed forces.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

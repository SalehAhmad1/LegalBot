(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/330) (which set fees for the exercise of various functions in connection with immigration and nationality) and the Passport (Fees) Regulations 2022 (S.I. 2022/660) (which set fees for the exercise of various functions in connection with passports).
In particular, the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2018 are amended as follows—
regulation 3 reflects a change in the title of Appendix Shortage Occupations List to the immigration rules to Appendix Immigration Salary List;
regulation 4 makes an amendment consequential on the introduction of Appendix Family Reunion (Protection) to the immigration rules;
regulation 5 amends the exception relating to fees for applications to vary limited leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom to allow recourse to public funds so that the exception applies to all such applications;
regulation 6 introduces a new exception to the requirement to pay a fee in relation to certain applications for limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom under Appendix Hong King British National (Overseas) of the immigration rules;
regulation 7 introduces a new exception to the requirement to pay a fee for variation of an application to settle in the United Kingdom under Appendix Long Residence to the immigration rules where the variation is made by the Secretary of State under paragraph 15.2 of that Appendix;
regulation 8 introduces a new fee, and an exception to the requirement to pay that fee, for contact point meetings required under Appendix Innovator Founder of the immigration rules;
regulation 9 makes various amendments consequential on the introduction of Appendix HM Armed Forces to the immigration rules;
regulation 10 and the table in Schedule 1 increase various fees;
regulation 11 combines two (location specific) fees into a single fee for expedited entry using the Border Force fast track service;
regulation 12 introduces new fees for the approval of sponsors under the Sponsor a Worker scheme.
Regulation 13 makes transitional provision. Regulation 13(1) ensures that the change in title of the Appendix Shortage Occupation List to the Appendix Immigration Salary List does not interfere with the operation of shortage list certificates of sponsorship which are issued before the change comes into force. Regulation 13(3) enables the general fee payable for applications for limited leave to remain in the United Kingdom which are made following unsuccessful waiver applications not to take account of the increases made by these Regulations.
Regulation 14 and the table in Schedule 2 increase various fees specified in the Passport (Fees) Regulations 2022.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs to business has been produced. An Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.

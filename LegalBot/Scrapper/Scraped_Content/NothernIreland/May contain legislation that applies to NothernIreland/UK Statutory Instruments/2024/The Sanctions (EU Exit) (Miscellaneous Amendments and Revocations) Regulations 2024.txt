14th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) (“the Sanctions Act”).
The Regulations make amendments to a number of sanctions regulations which have been made under section 1 of the Sanctions Act.
The Regulations amend the following sanctions regulations to introduce a new power to designate persons for the purpose of disqualifying those persons from being a director of a company or directly or indirectly taking part in or being concerned in the promotion, formation or management of a company; namely—
the Venezuela (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/135),
the Republic of Guinea-Bissau (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/554),
the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/600),
the Zimbabwe (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/604),
the Chemical Weapons (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/618),
the Syria (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/792),
the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/855),
the Guinea (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1145),
the Cyber (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/597),
the Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/608),
the Nicaragua (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/610),
the Global Human Rights Sanctions Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/680),
the Unauthorised Drilling Activities in the Eastern Mediterranean (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1474)
the Global Anti-Corruption Sanctions Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/488), and
the Myanmar (Sanctions) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/496).
The Regulations also amend provisions of the following sanctions regulations relating to the enforcement of trade sanctions, in particular as regards the application of enforcement provisions of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (c. 2):
the Venezuela (Sanctions) (Human Rights) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019,
the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019,
the Zimbabwe (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019,
the Syria (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019,
the Russia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, and
the Myanmar (Sanctions) Regulations 2021.
Regulation 4 also makes further amendments and corrections to the Republic of Belarus (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019:
to introduce a new obligation for designated persons to report funds or economic resources which that person owns, holds or controls, and the location of those. This is supported by a new power for the Treasury to impose civil monetary penalties where a person commits an offence by refusing or failing to comply with that obligation, or knowingly or recklessly, giving false information,
to introduce new trade prohibitions in relation to aluminium and certain critical-industry goods and critical-industry technology concerning:
electronics,
navigation and avionics, and
aerospace and propulsion,
to make minor corrections (see paragraph 6(b), (23) and (24)).
These Regulations also revoke the Burundi (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/1142).

At 10.00 a.m. on 29th February 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001/3998) (“the 2001 Regulations”) and the Misuse of Drugs (Designation) (England, Wales and Scotland) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/704) (“the 2015 Order”) and revoke the Misuse of Drugs and Misuse of Drugs (Designation) (England and Wales and Scotland) (Amendment) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 2024/239) (“the initial 2024 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(2) adds twenty-one substances (including seventeen synthetic opioids, sixteen of which are nitazenes) to Schedule 1 to the 2001 Regulations. Regulation 2(3) removes two synthetic opioids, both of which are nitazenes (clonitazene and etonitazene), from Schedule 2 to the 2001 Regulations, following their insertion into Schedule 1 to the 2001 Regulations by regulation 2(2)(c) and (f). Regulation 2(4) adds remimazolam to Part 1 of Schedule 4 to the 2001 Regulations. The Schedule in which a controlled drug is placed affects the extent to which the drug can be lawfully imported, exported, produced, supplied or possessed and dictates the controls that the drug is subject to, such as the record-keeping, labelling and destruction requirements in relation to that drug.
Regulation 3 adds the twenty-one substances added to Schedule 1 of the 2001 Regulations to Schedule 1 to the 2015 Order. Section 7(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (c. 38) requires the Secretary of State to make regulations to allow drugs controlled under that Act to be used for medicinal purposes. Section 7(3), however, does not apply to any drug which is designated by order under section 7(4) of that Act. Controlled drugs are designated where the Secretary of State is of the opinion that it is in the public interest for production, supply and possession of that drug to be either wholly unlawful or unlawful except for research or other special purposes, or for medicinal use of the drug to be unlawful except under licence. Schedule 1 to the 2015 Order specifies the list of controlled drugs to which section 7(4) applies.
Regulation 4 revokes the initial 2024 Regulations, which were made in error on 20th February 2024 and, if not revoked by these Regulations, would have come into force on 20th March 2024. Regulations 2 and 3 reflect, and replace, the amendments made by the initial 2024 Regulations.

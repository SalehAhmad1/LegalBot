(1)
EUR 2017/625. Annex 6 was inserted by S.I. 2020/1481 for the purposes of its application in relation to the entry of relevant goods from a relevant third country during the transitional staging period. The terms “relevant goods”, “relevant third country” and “the transitional staging period” are defined in paragraph 2 of Annex 6, as amended by S.I. 2022/1315 and 2023/959. Annex 6 was amended by S.I. 2021/429, 2021/809, 2022/621, 2022/1315, 2023/959, 2023/1131 and 2024/20. It was also amended in relation to England and Wales by S.I. 2021/1096, 2021/1443 and in relation to Scotland by S.S.I. 2021/342, 2021/493 and 2022/90.
(2)
S.I. 2011/1197; relevant amending instruments are S.I. 2019/1488, 2020/109, 2020/1462, 2020/1631, 2021/429, 2021/443, 2021/453, 2021/809, 2021/1096, 2021/1443, 2022/1315, 2022/1322, 2024/20. Paragraph 11A of Schedule 2 is inserted by S.I. 2020/1631 and enables the Secretary of State to amend, modify or revoke any retained direct minor EU legislation made under Article 8(4) of Council Directive 2002/99/EC laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (O.J. No. L 18, 23.1.2008, p.11) (“the 2002 Directive”). S.I. 2020/1666, which is amended by regulation 3 of this instrument, modifies Commission Decision 2000/572/EC laying down animal and public health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of minced meat and meat preparations from third countries (EUDN 2000/572). Commission Decision 2000/572/EC (O.J. No. L 240, 23.9.2000, p.19) was adopted under Council Directive 94/65/EC laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations (O.J. No. L 368, 31.12.1994, p.10) (“the 1994 Directive”), but is to be construed as being made under the 2002 Directive by virtue of provision in Directive 2004/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (O.J. No. L 157, 30.4.2004, p.33) (“the 2004 Directive”). The 2004 Directive, which repealed the 1994 Directive, provided in Article 4 that references to certain Directives, including the 1994 Directive, should be construed as being made, as the context demands, to the 2002 Directive; accordingly, that rule of construction has the effect that the power in paragraph 11A of Schedule 2 to S.I. 2011/1197 to modify retained direct minor EU legislation made under Article 8(4) of the 2002 Directive extends to the modification of Commission Decision 2000/572/EC.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 amends Commission Decision 2000/572/EC (EUDN 2000/572) to remove the import condition that meat preparations from third countries have been deep-frozen at the production plant or plants of origin.
Regulation 3 revokes, in consequence, provisions of the Meat Preparations (Amendment and Transitory Modification) (England) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/1666) which modified that import condition.
Regulation 4 amends the Official Controls (Extension of Transitional Periods) Regulations 2021 (S.I. 2021/809) (“the 2021 Regulations”), to change the end date of “the transitional staging period” from 29th April 2024 to 31st January 2025.
“The transitional staging period” is defined in paragraph 2 of Annex 6 to Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council on official controls and other official activities performed to ensure the application of food and feed law, rules on animal health and welfare, plant health and plant protection products (EUR 2017/625). In accordance with that definition, the period ends on the date appointed by the Secretary of State. This date was originally appointed in the 2021 Regulations and is now amended by regulation 4.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

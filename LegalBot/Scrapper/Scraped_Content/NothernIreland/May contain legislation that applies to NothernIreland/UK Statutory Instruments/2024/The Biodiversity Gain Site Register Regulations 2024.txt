5.—(1) Land may be registered in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to a conservation covenant(1) or a section 106 agreement.
(2) But the register operator may not register land in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to a particular conservation covenant or section 106 agreement if the land or any part of it, or any land including it or any part of it, is already registered in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to that conservation covenant or section 106 agreement.
(3) In order for land to be registered in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to a particular conservation covenant or section 106 agreement—
(a)
the land must be eligible to be registered in relation to that conservation covenant or section 106 agreement (see regulation 6), and
(b)
an application to register it in relation to that conservation covenant or section 106 agreement must be made to and accepted by the register operator (see regulations 7, 8 and 9).
(4) Where land is registered in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to a conservation covenant, that land or any part of it, or any land including it or any part of it, may also be registered (separately) in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to a section 106 agreement or a different conservation covenant (subject to paragraphs (2) and (3)).
(5) Where land is registered in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to a section 106 agreement, that land or any part of it, or any land including it or any part of it, may also be registered (separately) in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to a conservation covenant or a different section 106 agreement (subject to paragraphs (2) and (3)).
(1)
For the meaning of “conservation covenant” see section 118(1) of the Environment Act 2021.Land eligible to be registered
6.—(1) Land is eligible to be registered in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to a particular conservation covenant or section 106 agreement if the conditions in paragraphs (2) to (7) are met.
(2) The first condition is that one or more persons are required under the conservation covenant or section 106 agreement to carry out works on the land for the purpose of habitat enhancement(1).
(3) The second condition is that one or more persons are required under the conservation covenant or section 106 agreement to maintain the habitat enhancement to be achieved by the required enhancement works on the land under the conservation covenant or section 106 agreement for at least 30 years after the completion of those works.
(4) The third condition is that one or more persons are required under the conservation covenant or section 106 agreement to monitor habitats on the land to ensure that the habitat enhancement to be achieved by the required enhancement works on the land under the conservation covenant or section 106 agreement is maintained for the period for which the conservation covenant or section 106 agreement requires it to be maintained.
(5) The fourth condition is that, for the purposes of Schedule 7A to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the habitat enhancement to be achieved by the required enhancement works on the land under the conservation covenant or section 106 agreement is made available to be allocated (conditionally or unconditionally, and whether for consideration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the covenant, or (as the case may be) in accordance with the terms of one or more planning obligations in the section 106 agreement, to one or more developments for which planning permission is granted(2).
(6) The fifth condition is that the land is in England.
(7) The sixth condition is that the conservation covenant or (as the case may be) the planning obligations in the section 106 agreement are registered in the local land charges register or the appropriate local land charges register(3).
(8) For the purposes of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4), a person is only to be regarded as being required under a section 106 agreement to carry out works on land, to maintain the habitat enhancement to be achieved by such works or to monitor habitats on land if that person is required to carry out those works, maintain that habitat enhancement or monitor those habitats (as the case may be) under one or more planning obligations in that section 106 agreement.
(9) In this regulation “the required enhancement works” on land under a conservation covenant or section 106 agreement are all of the works required to be carried out on that land for the purpose of habitat enhancement under that conservation covenant or (as the case may be) under the planning obligations in that section 106 agreement.
(1)
“Habitat enhancement” means enhancement of the biodiversity of habitat: see section 100(11) of the Environment Act 2021 and paragraph 12(2) of Schedule 7A to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
(2)
By virtue of section 100(11) of the Environment Act 2021, the expressions “development” and “planning permission” have the same meanings as in Schedule 7A to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
(3)
The local land charges register is kept by the Chief Land Registrar under section 3 of the Local Land Charges Act 1975 (c. 76) which was substituted by paragraph 3 of Schedule 5 to the Infrastructure Act 2015 (c. 7). The “appropriate local land charges register” is the register of local land charges kept by a local authority where the Chief Land Registrar has not yet assumed functions relating to the registration of local land charges for the area of that local authority: see paragraph 40 of Schedule 5 to the Infrastructure Act 2015.Applications to register land in the biodiversity gain site register

2015 c. 26.Rebecca Pow
Parliamentary Under Secretary of State
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
17th January 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision for and in relation to a register of biodiversity gain sites (“the biodiversity gain site register”). “Biodiversity gain site” is defined in section 100(2) of the Environment Act 2021 (“the 2021 Act”).
These Regulations are made in connection with Schedule 7A to the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”), which makes provision for the grant of planning permission for a development in England to be subject to a condition to secure than the biodiversity gain objective in paragraph 2 of that Schedule is met in relation to the development. That objective is met if the biodiversity value attributable to the development exceeds, by at least 10%, the pre-development biodiversity value of habitat on the land to which the planning permission relates. For this purpose, the biodiversity value attributable to a development includes (subject to further conditions in Schedule 7A to the 1990 Act) the biodiversity value of any habitat enhancement which is recorded in the biodiversity gain site register and is allocated to the development. Section 100 of the 2021 Act provides for that register to be established by regulations.
Regulations 3 and 4 require Natural England to establish and maintain the biodiversity gain site register and to ensure that information in it is accessible to the public. References in these Regulations to “the register operator” are to Natural England.
Regulations 5 to 11 provide for the registration of land in the biodiversity gain site register. The Regulations provide for land to be registered in relation to a particular conservation covenant or section 106 agreement. Conservation covenants are provided for by Part 7 of the 2021 Act. Section 106 agreements are instruments by which planning obligations are entered into (whether by agreement or otherwise) under section 106 of the 1990 Act. It is possible for the same land to be registered more than once in the register, but not in relation to the same conservation covenant or section 106 agreement. Regulation 6 deals with eligibility of land to be registered. Regulations 7 and 8 provide for applications to register land. Regulations 9 to 11 provide for the determination of such applications and the registration of land by the register operator.
Regulations 12 to 16 apply where land is already registered in the biodiversity gain site register in relation to a particular conservation covenant or section 106 agreement. They provide for the recording on the register of any allocation of habitat enhancement on the land to a development for which planning permission has been granted. These regulations provide for applications to have such allocations recorded on the register, and for the determination of such applications by the register operator. As mentioned above, Schedule 7A to the 1990 Act provides for the biodiversity value of habitat enhancement allocated to a development to count towards the biodiversity value attributable to that development where the habitat enhancement in question is registered in the biodiversity gain site register.
Regulations 17 to 19 provide for the amendment of information on register on application to the register operator.
Regulations 20 to 23 allow the register operator to amend information on the register on its own initiative.
Regulations 24 to 29 provide for the removal of entries from the register, on application to the register operator and on the register operator’s own initiative.
Regulations 30 to 35 provide for appeals to the First-tier Tribunal against the rejection of applications, and other decisions of the register operator, under these Regulations.
Regulation 36 provides that the provision of any information or document to the register operator under these Regulations for any purpose has effect only for that purpose. It also provides that decisions of the register operator under the Regulations may not be taken as indicating consent to or approval of particular works to be carried out on land.
Regulation 37 provides that copyright is not infringed where the register operator does anything which is necessary to comply with its obligations to place specified documents on the biodiversity gain site register or make them accessible to the public under regulation 4.
Regulations 38 to 40 contain provision about the way in which notices may be given by the register operator under these Regulations and about the postal address or email address to which such a notice is to be sent.
Regulation 41 provides for the Secretary of State to carry out periodic reviews of the regulatory provision (within the meaning of section 32 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015) made by these Regulations.
The Biodiversity Gain Site Register (Financial Penalties and Fees) Regulations 2024 set fees for applications under these Regulations. They also give the register operator a power to impose a financial penalty where false or misleading information is supplied in connection with an application to register land in the biodiversity gain site register under these Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument because no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

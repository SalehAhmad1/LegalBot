(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order grants temporary planning permission for development at the former RAF Scampton relating to the provision of accommodation and other forms of support to single adult male asylum-seekers and failed asylum-seekers.
The land to which the Order applies is shown on a map, a copy of which is available for inspection from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, 2 Marsham Street, London, SW1P 4DF, and online from www.gov.uk.
The development permitted consists of the material change in the use of buildings or other land, building and other operations, and reinstatement works. The specific types of development permitted by the Order are set out in article 4 and Schedule 2 and further detail is given in the documents listed in Schedule 1.
The permission granted under the Order ceases at the end of 10th October 2027.
Planning permission granted by the Order is subject to conditions set out in Schedule 3, as well as any further conditions the Secretary of State may impose when approving a document that is required to be approved under the Order, or a variation to such a document (or to a document listed in Schedule 1). The procedure for such approvals is set out in articles 5 and 6; article 7 provides for relevant documents to be made publicly available, and how they are to be made publicly available.
A full regulatory impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument: as the instrument does not regulate business activity, it is not in the scope of the Government’s Better Regulation Framework.
For illustrative purposes only a plan of the land to which this Order applies is appended below.

(This note is not part of the Order in Council)
This Order amends the Air Navigation (Overseas Territories) Order 2013 (“the Order”) (S.I. 2013/2870) to update regulatory standards and to ensure that the aviation safety regime in the Overseas Territories complies with the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Chicago Convention of 7th December 1944.
The amendments include new provisions in relation to access to aerodromes for enforcement purposes (article 4), maintenance of the aircraft register (article 5), the regulation of small unmanned aircraft and large unmanned aircraft (articles 7 and 13), the acceptance of digital signatures (article 12), ensuring written confirmation to the pilot in command about the carriage of weapons of war in certain circumstances (article 8), and the reporting of dangerous goods (article 9).
The amendments also incorporate some of the latest definitions contained within the Chicago Convention and Procedures for Air Navigation Services - Air Traffic Management (“PANS-ATM”) and ensure compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) standards (article 11).
In addition, this Order makes changes to Schedule 4 to the Order (Rules of the Air) by updating the provisions relating to signals and marking, and makes changes to Schedule 5 to the Order by including penalties in relation to flights by large unmanned aircraft (articles 14 and 15).
A consultation in respect of these amendments was conducted with the territories subject to the Order and no objections were raised in relation to any of them.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside this Order and is available on www.legislation.gov.uk .

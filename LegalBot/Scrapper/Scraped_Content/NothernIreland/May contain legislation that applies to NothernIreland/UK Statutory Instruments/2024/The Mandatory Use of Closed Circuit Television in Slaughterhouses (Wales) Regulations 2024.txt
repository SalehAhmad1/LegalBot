22 May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision complementary to the Welfare of Animals (Transport) (Wales) Order 2007 (“the 2007 Order”), EU Regulation 1099/2009 on the protection of animals at the time of killing (“the EU Regulation”) and the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (Wales) Regulations 2014 (“the 2014 Regulations”).
These Regulations introduce requirements on operators of slaughterhouses (“business operators”) in Wales to install and operate a closed circuit television (“CCTV”) system in all areas where live animals are present (regulation 3). Regulation 4 requires business operators to retain CCTV footage and associated data for a period of 90 days. Inspectors are given powers to require compliance with these Regulations. This includes powers of inspection and seizure where an inspector has entered premises for the purposes of executing and enforcing the 2014 Regulations, the EU Regulation or the 2007 Order (regulation 5) and powers to issue enforcement notices (regulation 6). Regulation 7 makes provision for appeals relating to notices under regulation 6, and regulation 8 makes further provision in relation to notices. Regulations 9 and 10 provide that contravention of regulations 3 and 4, failure to comply with an enforcement notice and obstructing inspectors are offences. Regulations 11 to 14 make further provision in relation to offences and prosecutions.
The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ and is published on www.gov.wales.

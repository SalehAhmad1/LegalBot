(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (c. 13) for the purposes of implementing obligations that the United Kingdom has by virtue of the sanctions measures imposed to counter Al-Shabaab and other terrorist or armed groups operating in Somalia. UN Security Council Resolution 2713 (2023), adopted on 1st December 2023, imposed an arms embargo on Al-Shabaab and other terrorist armed groups. UN Security Council Resolution 2714 (2023), also adopted on 1st December 2023, lifted the arms embargo on Somalia. These Regulations make amendments to the Somalia (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/642) (“the 2020 Regulations”), including to regulation 2 (interpretation) and regulation 4 (purposes), to bring them in line with the wording and content of UN Security Council Resolutions 2713 (2023) and 2714 (2023).
These Regulations also amend regulation 4 (purposes) and regulation 6 (criteria for designating a person) of the 2020 Regulations to enable the UK Government to designate individuals as an “involved person” those who support terrorist or armed groups in Somalia by: supplying arms, weapons or ammunition; supplying IED components goods or IED components technology; by recruiting civilians, or by disseminating extremist material.

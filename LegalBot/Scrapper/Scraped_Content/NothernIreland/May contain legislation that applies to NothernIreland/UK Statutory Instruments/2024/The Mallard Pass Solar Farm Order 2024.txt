(5) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (4), a court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street including the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of that part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given that person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and that those instructions had been carried out.
(6) Paragraphs (2) to (5) do not apply where the undertaker is the street authority for a street in which the works are being carried out.Temporary closure of and permitting vehicular use on public rights of way

1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or the imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply as respects compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5—
(a)
for the words “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for the words “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purpose of exercising a right in pursuant of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 10 to the Mallard Pass Solar Farm Order 2024;
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 10 to the Mallard Pass Solar Farm Order 2024) to acquire an interest in the land; and

the acquiring authority enters on and takes possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land where it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1981) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act to the acquisition of land under article 19 (compulsory acquisition of land) and as modified by article 27 (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right under article 22 (compulsory acquisition of rights)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restriction imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is to be enforceable.
(3) For section 7 of the 1965 Act (measure of compensation in case of severance) substitute—
In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act (which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (persons without power to sell their interests);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified to secure that, as from the date on which the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to compulsory acquisition under article 19 (compulsory acquisition of land), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant (which is deemed for this purpose to have been created on the date of service of the notice); and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (penalty for unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20 (7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 27(4) (modification of Part 1 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965) is so modified as to enable the acquiring authority, in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired or restrictive covenant imposed, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (counter notice requiring purchase of land not in notice to treat substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an acquiring authority serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and have not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the 1981 Act as applied by article 24 (application of the 1981 Act) of the Mallard Pass Solar Farm Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 25(3) (acquisition of subsoil only) of the Mallard Pass Solar Farm Order 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter notice, or
(c)
refer the counter notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of three months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal they must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period they are to be treated as if they had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory; cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making its determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the authority may at any time within the period of six weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes its determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph they must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense cause by the giving and withdrawal of the notice.
(3) Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

SCHEDULE 14
ARBITRATION RULES
Commencing an arbitration
1.  The arbitration is deemed to have commenced when a party (“the claimant”) serves a written notice of arbitration on the other party (“the respondent”).
Time periods
2.—(1) All time periods in these arbitration rules are measured in days and include weekends, but not bank or public holidays.
(2) Time periods are calculated from the day after the arbitrator is appointed which is either—
(a)
the date the arbitrator notifies the parties in writing of his/her acceptance of an appointment by agreement of the parties; or
(b)
the date the arbitrator is appointed by the Secretary of State.
Timetable
3.—(1) The timetable for the arbitration is that which is set out in sub-paragraphs (2) to (4) below unless amended in accordance with paragraph 5(3).
(2) Within 14 days of the arbitrator being appointed, the claimant must provide both the respondent and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement of claim which describes the nature of the difference between the parties, the legal and factual issues, the claimant’s contentions as to those issues, the amount of its claim or the remedy it is seeking;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of all documents on which it relies, including contractual documentation, correspondence (including electronic documents), legal precedents and expert witness reports.
(3) Within 14 days of receipt of the claimant’s statements under sub-paragraph (2) by the arbitrator and respondent, the respondent must provide the claimant and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement of defence consisting of a response to the claimant’s statement of claim, its statement in respect of the nature of the difference, the legal and factual issues in the claimant’s claim, its acceptance of any elements of the claimant’s claim and its contentions as to those elements of the claimant’s claim it does not accept;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of all documents on which it relies, including contractual documentation, correspondence (including electronic documents), legal precedents and expert witness reports;
(c)
any objection it wishes to make to the claimant’s statements, comments on the claimant’s expert reports (if submitted by the claimant) and explanations of the objections.
(4) Within seven days of the respondent serving its statements under sub-paragraph (3), the claimant may make a statement of reply by providing both the respondent and the arbitrator with—
(a)
a written statement responding to the respondent’s submissions, including its reply in respect of the nature of the difference, the issues (both factual and legal) and its contentions in relation to the issues;
(b)
all statements of evidence and copies of documents in response to the respondent’s submissions;
(c)
any expert report in response to the respondent’s submissions;
(d)
any objections to the statements of evidence, expert reports or other documents submitted by the respondent; and
(e)
its written submissions in response to the legal and factual issues involved.
Procedure
4.—(1) The parties’ pleadings, witness statements and expert reports (if any) must be concise. A single pleading must not exceed 30 single-sided A4 pages using 10pt Arial font.
(2) The arbitrator will make an award on the substantive differences based solely on the written material submitted by the parties unless the arbitrator decides that a hearing is necessary to explain or resolve any matters.
(3) Either party may, within two days of delivery of the last submission, request a hearing giving specific reasons why it considers a hearing is required.
(4) Within seven days of receiving the last submission, the arbitrator must notify the parties whether a hearing is to be held and the length of that hearing.
(5) Within ten days of the arbitrator advising the parties that a hearing is to be held, the date and venue for the hearing are to be fixed by agreement with the parties, save that if there is no agreement the arbitrator must direct a date and venue which the arbitrator considers is fair and reasonable in all the circumstances. The date for the hearing must not be less than 35 days from the date of the arbitrator’s direction confirming the date and venue of the hearing.
(6) A decision must be made by the arbitrator on whether there is any need for expert evidence to be submitted orally at the hearing. If oral expert evidence is required by the arbitrator, then any experts attending the hearing may be asked questions by the arbitrator.
(7) There is to be no examination or cross-examination of experts, but the arbitrator must invite the parties to ask questions of the experts by way of clarification of any answers given by the experts in response to the arbitrator’s questions. Prior to the hearing in relation to the experts—
(a)
at least 28 days before a hearing, the arbitrator must provide a list of issues to be addressed by the experts;
(b)
if more than one expert is called, they will jointly confer and produce a joint report or reports within 14 days of the issues being provided; and
(c)
the form and content of a joint report must be as directed by the arbitrator and must be provided at least seven days before the hearing.
(8) Within 14 days of a hearing or a decision by the arbitrator that no hearing is to be held the parties may by way of exchange provide the arbitrator with a final submission in connection with the matters in dispute and any submissions on costs. The arbitrator must take these submissions into account in the award.
(9) The arbitrator may make other directions or rulings as considered appropriate in order to ensure that the parties comply with the timetable and procedures to achieve an award on the substantive difference within four months of the date on which the arbitrator is appointed, unless both parties otherwise agree to an extension to the date for the award.
(10) If a party fails to comply with the timetable, procedure or any other direction then the arbitrator may continue in the absence of a party or submission or document, and may make a decision on the information before the arbitrator attaching the appropriate weight to any evidence submitted beyond any timetable or in breach of any procedure or direction.
(11) The arbitrator’s award must include reasons. The parties must accept that the extent to which reasons are given must be proportionate to the issues in dispute and the time available to the arbitrator to deliver the award.
Arbitrator’s powers
5.—(1) The arbitrator has all the powers of the Arbitration Act 1996, save where modified in this Schedule.
(2) There must be no discovery or disclosure, except that the arbitrator is to have the power to order the parties to produce such documents as are reasonably requested by another party no later than the statement of reply, or by the arbitrator, where the documents are manifestly relevant, specifically identified and the burden of production is not excessive. Any application and orders should be made by way of a Redfern Schedule without any hearing.
(3) Any time limits fixed in accordance with this procedure or by the arbitrator may be varied by agreement between the parties, subject to any such variation being acceptable to and approved by the arbitrator. In the absence of agreement, the arbitrator may vary the timescales or procedure—
(a)
if the arbitrator is satisfied that a variation of any fixed time limit is reasonably necessary to avoid a breach of the rules of natural justice and then;
(b)
only for such a period that is necessary to achieve fairness between the parties.
(4) On the date the award is made, the arbitrator will notify the parties that the award is completed, signed and dated, and that it will be issued to the parties on receipt of cleared funds for the arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
Costs
6.—(1) The costs of the arbitration must include the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the reasonable fees and expenses of any experts and the reasonable legal and other costs incurred by the parties for the arbitration.
(2) Where the difference involves connected or interrelated issues, the arbitrator must consider the relevant costs collectively.
(3) The final award must fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties are to bear them or in what proportion they are to be borne by the parties.
(4) The arbitrator must award recoverable costs on the general principle that each party should bear its own costs, having regard to all material circumstances, including such matters as exaggerated claims or defences, the degree of success for different elements of the claims, claims that have incurred substantial costs, the conduct of the parties and the degree of success of a party.
Confidentiality
7.—(1) Hearings in this arbitration are to take place in private.
(2) Materials, documents, awards, expert reports and any matters relating to the arbitration are confidential and must not be disclosed to any third party without prior written consent of the other party, save for any application to the courts or where disclosure is required under any legislative or regulatory requirement.Article 41

Regardless of the temporary prohibition or restriction of use of streets under the powers conferred by article 11 (temporary closure of and permitting vehicular use on public rights of way), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the prohibition or restriction was in that street.
5.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
6.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or over which access to any apparatus is enjoyed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land and to gain access to it must not be extinguished, until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation, and access to it has been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use reasonable endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40, and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that it desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work, in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land controlled by the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
7.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
8.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan, section and description of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan, section and description submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan, section and description under sub-paragraph (1) are submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 7 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 6(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan, section and description instead of the plan, section and description previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan, section and description.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan, section and description of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (2) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
9.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker the reasonable expenses incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2).
(2) There is to be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus where such extension is required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 6(2); and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
10.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any of the works referred to in paragraph 6(2), any damage is caused to any apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(3) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker which, if it withholds such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
11.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and a utility undertaking in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.

Protective works to buildings
21.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 17 (protective work to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of National Gas.
Acquisition of land
22.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker may not (a) appropriate or acquire or take temporary possession of any land or apparatus or (b) appropriate, acquire, extinguish, interfere with or override any easement, other interest or right and/or apparatus of National Gas otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between National Gas and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of National Gas or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Gas and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Gas reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between National Gas and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Gas unless otherwise agreed by National Gas, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure and/or secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works.
(3) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Gas and the undertaker, the undertaker and National Gas agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation and/or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation and/or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Gas and/or other enactments relied upon by National Gas as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule will prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Gas under paragraph 25 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, must not be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
23.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Gas to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Gas in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Gas advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Gas reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), secure any necessary consents for the alternative apparatus and afford to National Gas to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 24(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Gas may in its sole discretion, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to assist the undertaker to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation must not extend to the requirement for National Gas to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Gas and the undertaker.
(5) National Gas must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to a written diversion agreement having been entered into between the parties and the grant to National Gas of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
24.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Gas facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Gas and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Gas than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Gas.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Gas than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 31 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Gas as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection

(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;

(5) Any approval of National Gas required under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (6) or (8); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (1) and/or (2) apply, National Gas may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works executed under sub-paragraph (1) or (2) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (6), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Gas and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (9) by National Gas for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Gas will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where National Gas requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Gas’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and National Gas must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(9) If National Gas in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 17 to 19 and 22 to 24 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 23(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National Gas notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (8) and (9) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and comply with sub-paragraph (12) at all times.
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order National Gas must comply with National Gas’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “Specification for safe working in the vicinity of National Gas, High pressure Gas pipelines and associated installation requirements for third parties T/SP/SSW22” and HSE’s “HS(~G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
(13) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development the undertaker will implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that National Gas retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 26.
Expenses
26.—(1) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Gas and the undertaker and subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Gas within 30 days of receipt of an invoice or claim from National Gas all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Gas in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Gas in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Gas as a consequence of National Gas—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 23(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Gas;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 31 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Gas by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Gas in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Gas any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
27.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by it) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of National Gas, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods or energy, by National Gas, or National Gas becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from National Gas the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Gas in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Gas for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Gas, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Gas becoming liable to any third party and including Network Code Claims other than arising from any default of National Gas.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Gas on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Gas or in accordance with any requirement of National Gas or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless National Gas fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) will impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Gas, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any authorised works and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by National Gas as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 35 (consent to transfer the benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph (b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 27; and/or
(c)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working, or business interruption) arising from any such damage or interruption, which is not reasonably foreseeable.
(4) National Gas must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) National Gas must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) National Gas must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within National Gas’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Gas’s control and, if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker, National Gas must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
(7) Not to commence construction (and not to permit the commencement of such construction) of the authorised works on any land owned by National Gas or in respect of which National Gas has an easement or wayleave for its apparatus or any other interest or to carry out any works within 15 metres of National Gas’s apparatus until the following conditions are satisfied—
(a)
unless and until National Gas is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has first provided the acceptable security (and provided evidence that it will maintain such acceptable security for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and National Gas has confirmed the same to the undertaker in writing; and
(b)
unless and until National Gas is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and provided evidence to National Gas that it will maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and National Gas has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker.
(8) In the event that the undertaker fails to comply with 27(7) on this Part of this Schedule, nothing in this Part of this Schedule will prevent National Gas from seeking injunctive relief (or any other equitable remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Enactments and agreements
28.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between National Gas and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Gas in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
29.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised works, the undertaker or National Gas requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 23(2) or National Gas makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 25, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised works and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Gas’s undertaking and National Gas must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever National Gas’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
30.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 22(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable National Gas to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
31.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraphs 23(2), 23(4), 24(1) and 25 any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Gas under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Gas, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
Notices
32.  Notwithstanding article 42 (service of notices), any plans submitted to National Gas by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 25 must be submitted to https://lsbud.co.uk/ or such other address as National Gas may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker in writing.

On Street Apparatus
35.  Except for paragraphs 36 (apparatus of National Grid in stopped up streets), 41 (retained apparatus: protection), 42 (expenses) and 43 (indemnity) of this Schedule which will apply in respect of the exercise of all or any powers under this Order affecting the rights and apparatus of National Grid, the other provisions of this Schedule do not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and National Grid are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus of National Grid in stopped up streets
36.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 8 (street works), 9 (power to alter layout, etc., of streets), 10 (construction and maintenance of altered streets) or 11 (temporary closure of and permitting vehicular use on public rights of way), if National Grid has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street National Grid has the same rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up or temporary closure and the undertaker must grant to National Grid, or procure the granting to National Grid of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to National Grid in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up or temporary closure of any such street or highway but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or National Grid to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 39 of the power of the undertaker, subject to compliance with this sub-paragraph, to carry out works under paragraph 41.
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary closure or diversion of any highway under the powers of article 11, National Grid is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such temporarily closed highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the temporary closure or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
37.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 17 (protective works to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of National Grid.
Acquisition of land
38.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker may not (a) appropriate or acquire or take temporary possession of any land or apparatus or (b) appropriate, acquire, extinguish, interfere with or override any easement, other interest or right and/or apparatus of National Grid otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of National Grid or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Grid and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Grid reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid unless otherwise agreed by National Grid, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure and/or secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works.
(3) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Grid and the undertaker, the undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation and/or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation and/or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid and/or other enactments relied upon by National Grid as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule will prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 41 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, must not be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
39.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), secure any necessary consents for the alternative apparatus and afford to National Grid to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 40(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of or land secured by the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid may in its sole discretion, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to assist the undertaker to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation must not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker.
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to a written diversion agreement having been entered into between the parties and the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
40.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Grid facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Grid.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 47 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection
41.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan of the works to be executed and seek from National Grid details of the underground extent of their electricity assets.

(3) In relation to any works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres of any part of the foundations of an electricity tower or between any two or more electricity towers, the plan to be submitted under sub-paragraph (1) must, in addition to the matters set out in sub-paragraph (2), include a method statement describing—
(a)
details of any cable trench design including route, dimensions, clearance to pylon foundations;
(b)
demonstration that pylon foundations will not be affected prior to, during and post construction;
(c)
details of load bearing capacities of trenches;
(d)
details of any cable installation methodology including access arrangements, jointing bays and backfill methodology;
(e)
a written management plan for high voltage hazard during construction and ongoing maintenance of any cable route;
(f)
written details of the operations and maintenance regime for any cable, including frequency and method of access;
(g)
assessment of earth rise potential if reasonably required by National Grid’s engineers; and
(h)
evidence that trench bearing capacity is to be designed to support overhead line construction traffic of up to and including 26 tonnes in weight.
(4) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraph (2) or (3) apply until National Grid has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(5) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (6) or (7); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraph (2) or (3) apply, National Grid may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works executed under sub-paragraph (2) or (3) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (6), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where National Grid requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any authorised development (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required and National Grid must give notice its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraph (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 33 to 35 and 38 to 40 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 39(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the authorised development, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and comply with sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(12) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order, the undertaker must comply with National Grid’s policies for development near overhead lines EN43-8 and HSE’s guidance note 6 “Avoidance of Danger from Overhead Lines”.

42.—(1) Save where otherwise agreed in writing between National Grid and the undertaker and subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid within 30 days of receipt of an invoice or claim from National Grid all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 39(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 47 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
43.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by it) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from National Grid the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any third party and including STC Claims or an Incentive Deduction other than arising from any default of National Grid.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (2) unless National Grid fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) will impose any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any authorised works and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by National Grid as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of this Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 35 (consent to transfer the benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any authorised works yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph (b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 43; and/or
(c)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working, or business interruption) arising from any such damage or interruption, which is not reasonably foreseeable.
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) National Grid must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within National Grid’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Grid’s control and, if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker, National Grid must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
(7) Not to commence construction (and not to permit the commencement of such construction) of the authorised works on any land owned by National Grid or in respect of which National Grid has an easement or wayleave for is apparatus or any other interest to carry out any works within 15 metres of National Grid’s apparatus until the following conditions are satisfied—
(a)
unless and until National Grid is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has first provided the acceptable security (and provided evidence that it will maintain such acceptable security for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and National Grid has confirmed the same to the undertaker in writing; and
(b)
unless and until National Grid is satisfied acting reasonably (but subject to all necessary regulatory constraints) that the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (and the undertaker has procured acceptable insurance (all provided evidence to National Grid that it will maintain such acceptable insurance for the construction period of the authorised works from the proposed date of commencement of construction of the authorised works) and National Grid has confirmed the same in writing to the undertaker.
(8) In the event that the undertaker fails to comply with (7) of this Part of this Schedule, nothing in this Part of this Schedule will prevent National Grid from seeking injunctive relief (or any other equitable remedy) in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Enactments and agreements
44.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between National Grid and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
45.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised works, the undertaker or National Grid requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 39(2) or National Grid makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 41, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised works and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Grid’s undertaking and National Grid must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever National Grid’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by the undertaker, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
46.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 38(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.

64.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 11 (temporary closure of and permitting vehicular use on public rights of way), where Anglian Water has apparatus in the street or accessed by virtue of that street, it has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up or temporary closure and the undertaker must grant to Anglian Water legal easements reasonably satisfactory to Anglian Water in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of Anglian Water to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 67 or the power of the undertaker to carry out works under paragraph 69.
(2) Regardless of the temporary closure or diversion of any highway under the powers conferred by article 11, Anglian Water is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such temporarily closed highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the temporary closure or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
65.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 17 (protective works to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
Acquisition of land
66.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.

(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed Anglian Water must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Anglian Water and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(5) Anglian Water must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40, and after the grant to Anglian Water of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if Anglian Water gives notice in writing to the undertaker that it desires the undertaker to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker or to the extent that Anglian Water fails to proceed with that work in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or the undertaker and Anglian Water otherwise agree, that work, instead of being executed by Anglian Water, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water.
(7) If Anglian Water fails either reasonably to approve, or to provide reasons for its failure to approve along with an indication of what would be required to make acceptable, any proposed details relating to required removal works under sub-paragraph (2) within 28 days of receiving a notice of the required works from the undertaker, then such details are deemed to have been approved. For the avoidance of doubt, any such “deemed consent” does not extend to the actual undertaking of the removal works, which must remain the sole responsibility of Anglian Water or its contractors.
(8) Whenever alternative apparatus is to be or is being substituted for existing apparatus, the undertaker must, before taking or requiring any further step in such substitution works, use best endeavours to comply with Anglian Water’s reasonable requests for a reasonable period of time to enable Anglian Water to—
(a)
make network contingency arrangements; or
(b)
bring such matters as it may consider reasonably necessary to the attention of end users of the utility in question.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
68.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Anglian Water or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Anglian Water than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Anglian Water as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
(3) Such facilities and rights as are set out in this paragraph are deemed to include any statutory permits granted to the undertaker in respect of the apparatus in question, whether under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 or other legislation.
Retained apparatus
69.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus (or any means of access to it) the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 67(2), the undertaker must submit to Anglian Water a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Anglian Water for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Anglian Water is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Anglian Water under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If Anglian Water in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) and (6) to (7) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 67(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give to Anglian Water notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances, using reasonable endeavours to keep the impact of those emergency works on Anglian Water’s apparatus, ,on the operation of its water and sewerage network and on end-users of the services Anglian Water provides to a minimum.
(7) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) and without prejudice to the generality of the principles set out in that sub-paragraph, works are deemed to be in land near Anglian Water’s apparatus (where it is a pipe) if those works fall within the following distances measured from the medial line of such apparatus—
(a)
4 metres where the diameter of the pipe is less than 250 millimetres;
(b)
5 metres where the diameter of the pipe is between 250 and 400 millimetres; and
(c)
a distance to be agreed on a case by case basis and before the submission of the Plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted where the diameter of the pipe exceeds 400 millimetres.
Expenses and costs
70.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Anglian Water all expenses reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from the sub-paragraph would be payable to Anglian Water by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
71.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraph 65 or 67(2), or by reason of any subsidence resulting from such development or works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Anglian Water, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Anglian Water, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Anglian Water, accompanied by an invoice or claim from Anglian Water, in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Anglian Water for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Anglian Water on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Anglian Water or in accordance with any requirement of Anglian Water or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Anglian Water fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and professional like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the unlawful or unreasonable act, neglect or default of Anglian Water, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) Anglian Water must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made, without the consent of the undertaker (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.
(5) Anglian Water must use reasonable endeavours to mitigate in whole or in part and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands and penalties to which the undertaker must bear and pay the costs for.
Cooperation
72.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any of the authorised development, the undertaker or Anglian Water requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 67(2) or Anglian Water makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 69, the undertaker must use all reasonable endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Anglian Water’s undertaking, using existing processes where requested by Anglian Water, provided it is appropriate to do so, and Anglian Water must use all reasonable endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) Where the undertaker identifies any apparatus which may belong to or be maintainable by Anglian Water but which does not appear on any statutory map kept for the purpose by Anglian Water, it must inform Anglian Water of the existence and location of the apparatus as soon as reasonably practicable.
(3) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Anglian Water in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
(4) The undertaker and Anglian Water may by written agreement substitute any period of time for those periods set out in this Part of this Schedule.

supply the engineer with all such information as they may reasonably require with regard to a specified work or the method of constructing it.
80.  Network Rail must at all times afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker and its agents for access to any works carried out by Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule during their construction and must supply the undertaker with such information as it may reasonably require with regard to such works or the method of constructing them.
81.—(1) If any permanent or temporary alterations or additions to railway property are reasonably necessary in consequence of the construction or completion of a specified work in order to ensure the safety of railway property or the continued safe operation of the railway of Network Rail, such alterations and additions may be carried out by Network Rail and if Network Rail gives to the undertaker 56 days’ notice (or in the event of an emergency or safety critical issue such notice as is reasonable in the circumstances) of its intention to carry out such alterations or additions (which must be specified in the notice), the undertaker must pay to Network Rail the reasonable cost of those alterations or additions including, in respect of any such alterations and additions as are to be permanent, a capitalised sum representing the increase of the costs which may be expected to be reasonably incurred by Network Rail in maintaining, working and, when necessary, renewing any such alterations or additions.
(2) If during the construction of a specified work by the undertaker, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct that part of the specified work which in the opinion of the engineer is endangering the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker decides that part of the specified work is to be constructed, Network Rail must assume construction of that part of the specified work and the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval of a specified work under paragraph 77(3), pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may suffer by reason of the execution by Network Rail of that specified work.
(3) The engineer must, in respect of the capitalised sums referred to in this paragraph and paragraph 82(a), provide such details of the formula by which those sums have been calculated as the undertaker may reasonably require.

(a)
in constructing any part of a specified work on behalf of the undertaker as provided by paragraph 77(3) or in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 77(4) including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signallers, watch-persons and other persons whom it will be reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer, require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or from the substitution or diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work.
83.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
“Network Rail’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised development) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 77(1) for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 77(1)) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 77(1) has effect subject to the sub-paragraph.
(6) Prior to the commencement of operation of the authorised development the undertaker will test the use of the authorised development in a manner that will first have been agreed with Network Rail and if, notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing of the authorised development causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)
the undertaker must afford reasonable facilities to Network Rail for access to the undertaker’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(b)
Network Rail must afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker for access to Network Rail’s apparatus in the investigation of such EMI;
(c)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker any additional material information in its possession reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus or such EMI; and
(d)
the undertaker will not allow the use or operation of the authorised development in a manner that has caused or will cause EMI until measures have been taken in accordance with this paragraph to prevent EMI occurring.
(8) Where Network Rail approves modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus pursuant to sub-paragraph (5) or (6)—
(a)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of the relevant part of Network Rail’s apparatus;
(b)
any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus approved pursuant to those sub-paragraphs must be carried out and completed by the undertaker in accordance with paragraph 78.
(9) To the extent that it would not otherwise do so, the indemnity in paragraph 87(1) applies to the costs and expenses reasonably incurred or losses suffered by Network Rail through the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph (including costs incurred in connection with the consideration of proposals, approval of plans, supervision and inspection of works and facilitating access to Network Rail’s apparatus) or in consequence of any EMI to which sub-paragraph (6) applies.
(10) For the purpose of paragraph 82(a) any modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus under this paragraph will be deemed to be protective works referred to in that paragraph.
84.  If at any time after the completion of a specified work, not being a work vested in Network Rail, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker informing it that the state of maintenance of any part of the specified work appears to be such as adversely affects the operation of railway property, the undertaker must, on receipt of such notice, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to put that specified work in such state of maintenance as not adversely to affect railway property.
85.  The undertaker must not provide any illumination or illuminated sign or signal on or in connection with a specified work in the vicinity of any railway belonging to Network Rail unless it has first consulted Network Rail and it must comply with Network Rail’s reasonable requirements for preventing confusion between such illumination or illuminated sign or signal and any railway signal or other light used for controlling, directing or securing the safety of traffic on the railway.
86.  Any additional expenses which Network Rail may reasonably incur in altering, reconstructing or maintaining railway property under any powers existing at the making of this Order by reason of the existence of a specified work must, provided that 56 days’ previous notice of the commencement of such alteration, reconstruction or maintenance has been given to the undertaker, be repaid by the undertaker to Network Rail.
87.—(1) The undertaker must pay to Network Rail all reasonable costs, charges, damages and expenses not otherwise provided for in this Part of this Schedule which may be occasioned to or reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)
by reason of the construction, maintenance or operation of a specified work or the failure thereof; or
(b)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst engaged upon a specified work;
(c)
by reason of any act or omission of the undertaker or any person in its employ or of its contractors or others whilst accessing to or egressing from the authorised development;
(d)
in respect of any damage caused to or additional maintenance required to, railway property or any such interference or obstruction or delay to the operation of the railway as a result of access to or egress from the authorised development by the undertaker or any person in its employment or of its contractors or others;
(e)
in respect of costs incurred by Network Rail in complying with any railway operational procedures or obtaining any regulatory consents which procedures are required to be followed or consents obtained to facilitate the carrying out or operation of the authorised development,
and the undertaker must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or any such failure, act or omission: and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision will not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Network Rail must—
(a)
give the undertaker reasonable written notice of any such claims or demands;
(b)
not make any settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand without the prior consent of the undertaker; and
(c)

(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised development (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker) that are subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement and/or other legal or land interest of Cadent and/or affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Cadent and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as Cadent reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent and variations upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(3) The undertaker and Cadent agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation and/or removal of apparatus/including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation and/or removal of apparatus and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by Cadent and/or other enactments relied upon by Cadent as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by Cadent under paragraph 103 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, do not constitute agreements under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1) that involves decommissioned apparatus being left in situ the undertaker must accept a surrender of any existing easement and/or other interest of Cadent in such decommissioned apparatus and consequently acquire title to such decommissioned apparatus and release Cadent from all liabilities in respect of such decommissioned apparatus from the date of such surrender.
(6) Where an undertaker acquires land which is subject to any Cadent right or interest (including, without limitation, easements and agreements relating to rights or other interests) and the provisions of paragraph 101 do not apply, the undertaker must—
(a)
retain any notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land; and
(b)
where no such notice of Cadent’s easement right or other interest exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register) include (with its application to register title to the undertaker’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry) a notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land.
Removal of apparatus
101.—(1) If, in the exercise of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 100 or in any other authorised manner, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of Cadent to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and the rights and facilities referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the satisfaction of Cadent and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Cadent advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Cadent reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to Cadent to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 102(1) below) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus);
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus); and
(c)
to allow access to that apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus).
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent may, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for Cadent to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to do so.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3) have been afforded to Cadent to its satisfaction, then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
102.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed (in Cadent’s opinion) then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter will be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 109 (arbitration) of this Part of this Schedule and the arbitrator makes such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of Cadent
103.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to Cadent a plan and, if reasonably required by Cadent, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.

(4) Any approval of Cadent required under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (5) or (7); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(5) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (1) and/or (2) apply, Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Works to which this paragraph applies must only be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) or as relevant sub-paragraph (4), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent and in accordance with all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and Cadent will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of the authorised development (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If Cadent, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3)(3), (6) and (7) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 101(2), provided that such written notice must be given by Cadent to the undertaker within 28 days of submission of a plan pursuant to sub-paragraph (1).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(10) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works as defined in the 1991 Act but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with—
(a)
the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and
(b)
sub-paragraph (11) at all times.
(11) At all times when carrying out any works authorised under the Order the undertaker must comply with Cadent’s policies for safe working in proximity to gas apparatus “CD/SP/SSW/22 Cadent’s policies for safe working in the vicinity of Cadent’s Assets” and HSE’s “HS(~G)47 Avoiding Danger from underground services”.
(12) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme save that Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 104.
Expenses
104.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Cadent on demand all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or incurred by Cadent in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of the authorised development as are referred to in this Part of this Schedule including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by Cadent in connection with the negotiation or acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including professional fees) incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent—

using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 101(3) if it elects to do so; and/or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent;

the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule; and
(g)
any watching brief pursuant to paragraph 103(6).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 40 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save where it is not possible or appropriate in the circumstances (including due to statutory or regulatory changes) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
105.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from Cadent the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Cadent becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any negligence or default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (2) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan or as otherwise agreed between the undertaker and Cadent.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
the authorised development and/or any other works authorised by this Part of this Schedule carried out by Cadent as an assignee, transferee or lessee of the undertaker with the benefit of the Order pursuant to section 156 of the Planning Act 2008 or article 35 (consent to transfer the benefit of the Order) subject to the proviso that once such works become apparatus (“new apparatus”), any part of the authorised development yet to be executed and not falling within this sub-paragraph (b) will be subject to the full terms of this Part of this Schedule including this paragraph 105.
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaking and considering its representations.
Enactments and agreements
106.  Save to the extent provided for to the contrary elsewhere in this Part of this Schedule or by agreement in writing between Cadent and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Cadent in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
107.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or Cadent requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 101(2) or Cadent makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 103, the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Cadent’s undertaking and Cadent must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever Cadent’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by the undertaker or the taking of action by Cadent, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
108.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 100(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus (including appropriate working areas required to reasonably and safely undertake necessary works by Cadent in respect of the apparatus) is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable Cadent to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.

Further information and consultation
3.—(1) In relation to any application to which this Schedule applies, the relevant planning authority may request such reasonable further information from the undertaker as is necessary to enable it to consider the application.
(2) In the event that the relevant planning authority considers such further information to be necessary and the provision governing or requiring the application does not specify that consultation with a requirement consultee is required, the relevant planning authority must, within 20 working days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing specifying the further information required.
(3) If the provision governing or requiring the application specifies that consultation with a requirement consultee is required, the relevant planning authority must issue the consultation to the requirement consultee within 10 working days of receipt of the application, and must notify the undertaker in writing specifying any further information the relevant planning authority considers necessary or that is requested by the requirement consultee within 10 working days of receipt of such a request and in any event within 20 working days of receipt of the application (or such other period as is agreed in writing between the undertaker and the relevant planning authority).

the relevant planning authority refuses an application for any discharge or grants it subject to conditions;
(b)
the relevant planning authority is deemed to have refused an application pursuant to paragraph 2(4);

on receipt of a request for further information pursuant to paragraph 3 the undertaker considers that either the whole or part of the specified information requested by the relevant planning authority is not necessary for consideration of the application; or

(2) The steps to be followed in the appeal process are as follows—
(a)
any appeal by the undertaker must be made within 42 days of the date of the notice of the decision or the determination, or (where no determination has been made) the expiry of the time period set out in paragraph 2(1), giving rise to the appeal referred to in sub-paragraph (1);
(b)
the undertaker must submit the appeal documentation to the Secretary of State and must on the same day provide copies of the appeal documentation to the relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee;
(c)
the Secretary of State must appoint a person to determine the appeal as soon as reasonably practicable and must forthwith notify the appeal parties of the identity of the appointed person and the address to which all correspondence for the appointed person’s attention should be sent;
(d)
the relevant planning authority and any requirement consultee must submit written representations to the appointed person in respect of the appeal within 10 working days of the start date and must ensure that copies of their written representations are sent to each other and to the undertaker on the day on which they are submitted to the appointed person;
(e)
the undertaker may make any counter-submissions to the appointed person within 10 working days of receipt of written representations pursuant to sub-paragraph (d);
(f)
the appointed person must make their decision and notify it to the appeal parties, with reasons, as soon as reasonably practicable; and
(g)
the appointment of the person pursuant to sub-paragraph (c) may be undertaken by a person appointed by the Secretary of State for this purpose instead of by the Secretary of State.
(3) In the event that the appointed person considers that further information is necessary to enable the appointed person to consider the appeal they must as soon as reasonably practicable, notify the appeal parties in writing specifying the further information required.
(4) Any further information required pursuant to sub-paragraph (3) must be provided by the relevant party to the appointed person and the other appeal parties on the date specified by the appointed person (the “specified date”), and the appointed person must notify the appeal parties of the revised timetable for the appeal on or before that day. The revised timetable for the appeal must require submission of written representations to the appointed person within 10 working days of the specified date, but otherwise the process and time limits set out in sub-paragraphs (d) to (f) of sub-paragraph (2) apply.
(5) The appointed person may—
(a)
allow or dismiss the appeal; or
(b)
reverse or vary any part of the decision of the relevant planning authority (whether the appeal relates to that part of it or not),

(6) The appointed person may proceed to a decision on an appeal taking into account only such written representations as have been sent within the relevant time limits.

(8) The decision of the appointed person on an appeal is to be final and binding on the parties, unless proceedings are brought by a claim for judicial review.
(9) If an approval is given by the appointed person pursuant to this Schedule, it is to be deemed to be an approval for the purpose of Schedule 2 (requirements) as if it had been given by the relevant planning authority. The relevant planning authority may confirm any determination given by the appointed person in identical form in writing but a failure to give such confirmation (or a failure to give it in identical form) is not to be taken to affect or invalidate the effect of the appointed person’s determination.
(10) Save where a direction is given pursuant to sub-paragraph (11) requiring the costs of the appointed person to be paid by the relevant planning authority, the reasonable costs of the appointed person must be met by the undertaker.
(11) On application by the relevant planning authority or the undertaker, the appointed person may give directions as to the costs of the appeal parties and as to the parties by whom the costs of the appeal are to be paid. In considering whether to make any such direction and the terms on which it is to be made, the appointed person must have regard to advice on planning appeals and award costs published in Planning Practice Guidance: Appeals (March 2014) or any circular or guidance which may from time to time replace it.

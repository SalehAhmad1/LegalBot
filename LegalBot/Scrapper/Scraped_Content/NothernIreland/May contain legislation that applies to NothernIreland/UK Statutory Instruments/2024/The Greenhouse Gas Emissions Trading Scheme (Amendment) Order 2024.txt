Clerk of the Privy CouncilEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The United Kingdom Emissions Trading Scheme (the “UK ETS”) was established by the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Order 2020 (the “UK ETS Order”). The UK ETS runs for ten years, split into two five-year “allocation periods”. Operators of certain industrial installations are required to monitor, submit verified reports on, and surrender “allowances” equivalent to, their greenhouse gas emissions each year. Allowances are sold at auction, but some operators of installations and aircraft operators receive an allocation of allowances free of charge. For installations that meet the eligibility criteria, there are two schemes in addition to the main scheme, one for “hospitals or small emitters”, the other for “ultra-small emitters”.
This Order amends the UK ETS Order and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331 (the “Free Allocation Regulation”). The main changes are as follows—
the window for operators of installations to apply for free allocation, or to be in the schemes for hospital or small emitters or for ultra-small emitters, in the 2026-2030 allocation period or, where no such application is made, to provide information for the purposes of the scheme is moved to 1 April-30 June 2025;
the date by which the lists of hospital or small emitters and ultra-small emitters for the 2026-2030 allocation period must be published is moved to 17 October 2025;
the date before which the allocation table for the 2026-2030 allocation period must be published is moved to 28 February 2026.
No impact assessment has been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

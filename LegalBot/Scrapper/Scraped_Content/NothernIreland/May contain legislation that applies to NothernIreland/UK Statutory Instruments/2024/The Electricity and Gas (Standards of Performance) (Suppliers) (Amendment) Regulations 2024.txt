(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Electricity and Gas (Standards of Performance) (Suppliers) Regulation 2015 (S.I. 2015/1544) (the “Principal Regulations”). The Principal Regulations impose minimum guaranteed standards of performance in respect of the service provided by gas and electricity suppliers in Great Britain, and prescribe sums payable to a customer by way of compensation for failure to meet these performance standards.
Regulation 2 amends Regulation 6ZA of the Principal Regulations (obligation to complete a supplier transfer), which is the performance standard relating to the obligation on energy suppliers to complete a supplier transfer by a certain date. If a customer has requested that the new supplier begin the supply of energy before the end of a contractual or statutory cooling off period, the amendment will require the new supplier to complete the transfer request within 5 working days of receiving sufficient information to complete the transfer. Where the customer does not wish the new supplier to supply energy before the end of the cooling off period, the 5 working days will start either once sufficient information to complete the transfer has been received or at the expiry of 14 days beginning with the date on which the customer and new supplier entered into the contract, whichever is the latest to occur. Where a customer enters into a contract with a new supplier after 5pm on a working day, the reference to 5 working days is read as 6 working days.
Regulation 3 makes provision for dealing with a supplier transfer request under regulation 6ZA of the Principal Regulations where the request has been made but not completed before the coming into force of these Regulations. In such circumstances the Principal Regulations will continue to have effect as they did immediately before the coming into force of these Regulations to enable the request to continue to be dealt with in accordance with Regulation 6ZA as it applied before the changes were made to it by these Regulations.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

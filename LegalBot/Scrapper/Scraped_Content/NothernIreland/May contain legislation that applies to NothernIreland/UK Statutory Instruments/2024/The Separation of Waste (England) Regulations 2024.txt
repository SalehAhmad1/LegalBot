S.I. 2012/811; there are amendments to paragraph 1 of Schedule 1, none of which are relevant.EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations set out descriptions of the household waste and the relevant waste which is recyclable household waste and recyclable relevant waste for the purposes of sections 45A, 45AZA and 45AZB of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (c. 43) (“the 1990 Act”). These sections place requirements on English waste collection authorities and other waste collectors in England to meet conditions relating to the separate collection of recyclable household waste and recyclable relevant waste.
These Regulations also specify descriptions of premises which are to be considered relevant non-domestic premises for the purpose of section 45AZA of the 1990 Act, in addition to those premises referred to in section 45AZA (11)(a), (b) and (c) of the 1990 Act.
These Regulations also amend the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 (S.I. 2011/998), as they apply in relation to England, in order to omit regulation 13. Regulation 13 places duties on establishments and undertakings, and waste collection authorities, in relation to the collection of waste, which are no longer necessary given the new requirements set out in sections 45A, 45AZA and 45AZB of the 1990 Act. The provisions of the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 are to be repealed in stages, as section 45A and sections 45AZA and 45AZB are subject to different transitional arrangements and will come into force at difference times.

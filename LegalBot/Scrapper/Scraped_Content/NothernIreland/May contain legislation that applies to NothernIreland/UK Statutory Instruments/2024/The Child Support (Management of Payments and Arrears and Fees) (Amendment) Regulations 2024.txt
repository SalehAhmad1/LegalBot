23rd January 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulations 3 to 6 amend the Child Support (Management of Payments and Arrears) Regulations 2009 (S.I. 2009/3151) to make provision for further circumstances in which the Secretary of State may extinguish liability in respect of arrears of child support maintenance where it appears to the Secretary of State that it would be unfair or otherwise inappropriate to enforce liability in respect of those arrears.
These further circumstances in which the Secretary of State may extinguish liability arise when a maintenance calculation has ceased under specific provisions of the Child Support Act 1991, the arrears are less than £7 and the non-resident parent has failed to make any payments in the three months preceding the date on which the Secretary of State makes the decision to extinguish liability.
Regulation 7 revokes Part 2 of the Child Support Fees Regulations 2014 (S.I. 2014/612) to remove the application fee for child support maintenance from the date the revocation comes into force in accordance with regulation 1(2).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen. An Explanatory Memorandum has been published alongside these Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/2869) (“the 1995 Regulations”) and the Goods Vehicles (International Road Transport Permits and Haulage Within the EU) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 2024/679) (“the 2024 Regulations”). The 1995 Regulations extend to Great Britain and the 2024 Regulations extend to the United Kingdom.
Regulation 2 amends Schedule 3 to the 1995 Regulations in order to—
(a)
remove the requirement for the driver of a vehicle registered in Northern Ireland, brought temporarily into Great Britain and used for the carriage of goods other than for hire or reward, to carry a document setting out certain information in order to be exempt from the requirement to hold an operator licence in Great Britain;
(b)
update the classes of vehicles registered in Norway and brought temporarily into Great Britain for which there is an exemption to the requirement to have an operator licence, for example those carrying only certain goods or in respect of which a permit has been issued;
(c)
make minor amendments to address errors identified in the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) (Exemptions and Modifications) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (S.I. 2023/805) (“the 2023 Regulations”), which amended the 1995 Regulations (see regulation 2(2)(a), (c), (e) and (f)).
Regulation 2 also amends Schedule 3A to the 1995 Regulations to make a further modification to section 5 of the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 (c. 23) to address an error identified in the 2023 Regulations (see regulation 2(3)).
Regulation 3 amends the 2024 Regulations to provide for the issuing of permits for journeys to, in or through Norway. This includes providing for the duration of such permits, and specifying the uses which do not require a permit.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

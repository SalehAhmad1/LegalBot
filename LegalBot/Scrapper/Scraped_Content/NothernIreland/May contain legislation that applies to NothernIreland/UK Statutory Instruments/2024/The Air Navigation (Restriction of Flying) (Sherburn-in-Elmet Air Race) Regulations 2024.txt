EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Regulations) 
These Regulations impose restrictions on flying in the vicinity of Sherburn-in-Elmet, Yorkshire, 
by the reason of the intended holding there of a Royal Aero Club Air Race on 18th May 2024 and 
19th May 2024. 
A large number of aircraft will be involved in high energy manoeuvres during the event and

The times mentioned in regulation 3(1) are Co-ordinated Universal Time (UTC) which is one hour 
behind British Summer Time (BST).

air-ground service and the Royal Aero Club Records, Racing and Rally Association Race Officials 
may be contacted as notified.

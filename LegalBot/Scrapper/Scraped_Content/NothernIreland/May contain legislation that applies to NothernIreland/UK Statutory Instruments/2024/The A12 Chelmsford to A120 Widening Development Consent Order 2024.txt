The application was examined by a Panel of three members (“the Panel”) appointed as an examining authority (appointed by the Secretary of State) in accordance with Chapter 4 of Part 6 of the 2008 Act and the Infrastructure Planning (Examination Procedure) Rules 2010(3).
The Panel, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn and the application together with the accompanying documents, in accordance with section 74(2) of the 2008 Act has submitted a report and recommendation to the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State, having considered the representations made and not withdrawn, and the report and recommendation of the Panel, has decided to make an Order granting development consent for the development described in the application with modifications which in the opinion of the Secretary of State do not make any substantial changes to the proposals comprised in the application.

The Secretary of State, having considered the report and recommendation of the Panel, is satisfied that special category (rights) land identified in Part 3 of Schedule 8 to this Order, when burdened with the new rights authorised for compulsory acquisition under the terms of this Order, will be no less advantageous than it was before such acquisition, to the persons in whom it is vested, other persons, if any, entitled to rights of common or other rights, and the public and that, accordingly, section 132(3) of the 2008 Act applies.
The Secretary of State is satisfied that replacement land (as that land is defined in section 132(12) of the 2008 Act) has been or will be given in exchange for order rights (as defined in that section) to be acquired over the special category (rights) land identified in Part 2 of Schedule 8 to this Order, and replacement land has been or will be vested in the persons or persons in whom the special category land is vested and subject to the same rights, trusts and incidents as attach to the special category land, and that, accordingly, section 132(4) of the 2008 Act applies.
The Secretary of State, in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 114(4), 115(5), 117(6), 120(7), 122(8) and 123(9) of, and paragraphs 1 to 3, 10 to 17, 19 to 23, 26, 33, 36 and 37 of Part 1 of Schedule 5(10) to, the 2008 Act, makes the following Order—

13.—(1) Any highway (other than a trunk road) to be constructed under this Order must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the relevant local highway authority in whose area the highway lies and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the relevant local highway authority, the highway must be maintained by and at the expense of the relevant local highway authority from its completion.
(2) Where a highway (other than a trunk road) is altered or diverted under this Order, the altered or diverted part of the highway must be completed to the reasonable satisfaction of the relevant local highway authority and, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the relevant local highway authority, that part of the highway must be maintained by and at the expense of the relevant local highway authority from its completion.
(3) Where a highway is de-trunked under this Order—
(a)
section 265(1) (transfer of property and liabilities upon a highway becoming or ceasing to be a trunk road) of the 1980 Act applies in respect of that highway; and
(b)
any alterations to that highway undertaken under powers conferred by this Order prior to and in connection with that de-trunking must, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the relevant local highway authority, be maintained by and at the expense of the relevant local highway authority from the date of de-trunking.
(4) In the case of a bridge constructed under this Order to carry a highway (other than a trunk road) over a trunk road, the highway surface (being those elements over the waterproofing membrane) must be maintained by and at the expense of the relevant local highway authority unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the relevant local highway authority, and the remainder of the bridge, including the waterproofing membrane, the structure below the waterproof membrane and the parapets must be maintained by and at the expense of the undertaker.
(5) In any action against the undertaker in respect of loss or damage resulting from any failure by it to maintain a street under this article, it is a defence (without prejudice to any other defence or the application of the law relating to contributory negligence) to prove that the undertaker had taken such care as in all the circumstances was reasonably required to secure that the part of the street to which the action relates was not dangerous to traffic.
(6) For the purposes of a defence under paragraph (5), the court must in particular have regard to the following matters—
(a)
the character of the street and the traffic which was reasonably to be expected to use it;
(b)
the standard of maintenance appropriate for a street of that character and used by such traffic;
(c)
the state of repair in which a reasonable person would have expected to find the street;
(d)
whether the undertaker knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that the condition of the part of the street to which the action relates was likely to cause danger to users of the street; and
(e)
where the undertaker could not reasonably have been expected to repair that part of the street before the cause of action arose, what warning notices of its condition had been displayed,
but for the purposes of such a defence it is not relevant to prove that the undertaker had arranged for a competent person to carry out or supervise the maintenance of the part of the street to which the action relates unless it is also proved that the undertaker had given the competent person proper instructions with regard to the maintenance of the street and the competent person had carried out those instructions.
(1)
Section 265 was amended by paragraph 52 of Schedule 1 to the Infrastructure Act 2015 (c. 7).Classification of roads, etc.
14.—(1) On the date on which the roads described in Part 1 (trunk roads) of Schedule 3 (classification of roads etc.) are completed and open for traffic, they are to become trunk roads as if they had become so by virtue of an order under section 10(2)(1) (general provision as to trunk roads) of the 1980 Act specifying that date as the date on which they were to become trunk roads.
(2) On the date on which the roads described in Part 2 (classified A roads), Part 3 (classified B roads) and Part 4 (classified C roads) of Schedule 3 are completed and open for traffic, they are to become classified roads for the purpose of any enactment or instrument which refers to highways classified as classified roads as if such classification had been made under section 12(3) (general provision as to principal and classified roads) of the 1980 Act.
(3) On and after the date on which the roads described in Part 5 (unclassified roads) of Schedule 3 are completed and open for traffic, they are to become unclassified roads for the purpose of any enactment or instrument which refers to roads which are not classified roads.
(4) On such day as the undertaker may determine, the orders specified in column (3) of Part 12 (revocations & variations of existing traffic regulation orders) of Schedule 3 are to be varied or revoked as specified in the corresponding row of column (4) of that Part in respect of the lengths of roads specified in the corresponding row of column (2) of that Part.

(6) On such day as the undertaker may determine, the roads described in Part 14 (roads to be de-trunked) of Schedule 3 are to cease to be trunk roads as if they had ceased to be trunk roads by virtue of an order made under section 10(2) of the 1980 Act specifying that date as the date on which they were to cease to be trunk roads.
(7) The undertaker may only make a determination for the purposes of paragraph (6) with the consent of the Secretary of State, who must consult the relevant local highway authority as to the date and as to whether the highway to be de-trunked is of a reasonably satisfactory standard for use as a local highway.
(8) The application of paragraphs (1) to (6) may be varied or revoked by any instrument made under any enactment which provides for the variation or revocation of such matters.
(1)
Section 10(2) was amended by section 22 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 Act and by section 1 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Infrastructure Act 2015 (c. 7).Speed limits

(2) Where the words “national speed limit” appear in column (3) of the table in Part 6 of Schedule 3, on and after the date on which the lengths of road identified in the corresponding row of column (2) of that table are open to traffic the national speed limit will apply to those lengths of roads.
(3) On and after the date on which the roads specified in Part 7 (variable speed limits) of Schedule 3 are open for traffic no person is to drive any motor vehicle on the lengths of road identified in column (2) of that Part at a speed exceeding the lesser of—
(a)
the national speed limit (if no limit in miles per hour is indicated by a variable message sign); or
(b)
the limit in miles per hour indicated by a speed limit sign displayed on a variable message sign, if one is so indicated.
(4) A section of road is subject to a variable speed limit in relation to a vehicle being driven along it if—

(b)
the vehicle has passed a speed limit sign displayed on a variable message sign; and
(c)
the vehicle has not subsequently passed—

another speed limit sign indicating a different speed limit; or
(ii)
a traffic sign which indicates that the national speed limit is in force.
(5) For the purposes of paragraph (3)—
(a)
the speed limit indicated by a variable message sign is the speed shown at the time the vehicle passes the sign, or, if higher, the speed limit shown by the sign ten seconds before the vehicle passed the sign;
(b)
if, ten seconds before the vehicle passed it, no speed limit in miles per hour is indicated by a variable message sign, the national speed limit applies.
(6) On and after the date on which the roads specified in the tables in Parts 6 (speed limits) and 7 (variable speed limits) of Schedule 3 are open for traffic, where the words “Removal of restricted road status” appear in column (3) of those tables, those lengths of road will cease to be restricted roads as if, on that date, a direction had been made under section 82(2)(a) (what roads are restricted roads) of the 1984 Act.
(7) No speed limit imposed by or under this Order applies to vehicles falling within regulation 3(4) of the Road Traffic Exemptions (Special Forces) (Variation and Amendment) Regulations 2011(1) when used in accordance with regulation 3(5) of those Regulations.
(8) The application of paragraphs (1) to (6) may be varied or revoked by any instrument under any enactment which provides for the variation or revocation of such matters, including by an instrument made under the 1984 Act where the matter in question could have been included in an order made under that Act.
(9) In this article—
“national speed limit” has the same meaning as in Schedule 1 to the 2016 Regulations and Directions and a traffic sign which indicates that the national speed limit applies means a traffic sign of the type shown in diagram 671 in Part 2 of Schedule 10 to the 2016 Regulations and Directions which is—
(a)
placed on or near a road; and
(b)
directed at traffic on the carriageway on which the vehicle is being driven,

(5) Any application to which this article applies must include a statement that the provisions of paragraph (4) apply to that application.
(6) Paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) do not apply where the undertaker is the street authority for a street in which the works are being carried out.Street Works

(2) Where a street is stopped up under article 19 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access) any statutory utility whose apparatus is under, in, on, over, along or across the street may, and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker must—
(a)
remove the apparatus and place it or other apparatus provided in substitution for it in such other position as the statutory utility may reasonably determine and have power to place it; or
(b)
provide other apparatus in substitution for the existing apparatus and place it in such position as described in sub-paragraph (a).
(3) Subject to the following provisions of this article, the undertaker must pay to any statutory utility an amount equal to the cost reasonably incurred by the statutory utility in or in connection with—

the execution of the relocation works required in consequence of the stopping up of the street; and

apparatus of a better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker, or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration to be necessary, then, if it involves cost in the execution of the relocation works exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be payable to the statutory utility by virtue of paragraph (3) is to be reduced by the amount of that excess.

(7) Paragraphs (3) to (6) do not apply where the authorised development constitutes major highway works, major bridge works or major transport works for the purposes of Part 3 of the 1991 Act, but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of cost of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section; and
(b)
the allowable costs are to be borne by the undertaker and the statutory utility in such proportions as may be prescribed by any such regulations.

“statutory utility” means a statutory undertaker for the purposes of the 1980 Act or a public communications provider as defined in section 151(1) (interpretation of Chapter 1) of the Communications Act 2003(1).

PART 2
PROCEDURE FOR DISCHARGE OF REQUIREMENTS
Applications made under requirements
22.—(1) Where an application has been made to the approving authority for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement (including agreement or approval in respect of part of a requirement) included in this Order, the approving authority must give notice to the undertaker of the decision on the application within a period of 8 weeks beginning with—
(a)
the day immediately following that on which the application is received by the approving authority;
(b)
the day immediately following that on which further information has been supplied by the undertaker under paragraph 22 (further information); or
(c)
such longer period as may be agreed between the parties.
(2) Subject to paragraph (3), in the event that the approving authority does not determine an application within the period set out in paragraph (1), the approving authority is taken to have granted all parts of the application (without any condition or qualification) at the end of that period.
(3) Where—
(a)
an application has been made to the approving authority for any consent, agreement or approval required by a requirement included in this Order;
(b)
the approving authority does not determine such application within the period set out in sub-paragraph (1); and
(c)
the application is accompanied by a report from a body required to be consulted under that requirement that considers it likely that the subject matter of the application is to give rise to any materially new or materially different environmental effects in comparison with those reported in the environmental statement,
the application is taken to have been refused by the approving authority at the end of that period.
Further information
23.—(1) In relation to any part of an application made under this Schedule, the approving authority has the right to request such further information from the undertaker as is necessary to enable the approving authority to consider the application.
(2) In the event that the approving authority considers such further information to be necessary, the approving authority must, within 21 business days of receipt of the application, notify the undertaker in writing specifying the further information required and (if applicable) to which part of the application it relates. In the event that the approving authority does not give such notification within that 21 business day period the approving authority is deemed to have sufficient information to consider the application and is not subsequently entitled to request further information without the prior agreement of the undertaker.
(3) Where further information is requested under this paragraph in relation to part only of an application, that part is treated as separate from the remainder of the application for the purposes of calculating the time periods referred to in paragraph 24 (applications made under requirements) and in this paragraph.
(4) In this paragraph, “business day” means a day other than Saturday or Sunday which is not Christmas Day, Good Friday or a bank holiday under section 1 (bank holidays) of the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971(3).
Register of requirements
24.—(1) The undertaker must, as soon as practicable following the making of this Order, establish and maintain in an electronic form suitable for inspection by members of the public a register of those requirements contained in Part 1 of this Schedule that provide for further approvals to be given by the approving authority.
(2) The register must set out in relation to each such requirement the status of the requirement, in terms of whether any approval to be given by the approving authority has been applied for or given, providing an electronic link to any document containing any approved details.
(3) The register must be maintained by the undertaker for a period of 3 years following completion of the authorised development.
Anticipatory steps towards compliance with any requirement
25.  If before the coming into force of this Order the undertaker or any other person has taken any steps that were intended to be steps towards compliance with any provision of Part 1 of this Schedule, those steps may be taken into account for the purpose of determining compliance with that provision if they would have been valid steps for that purpose had they been taken after this Order came into force.
Timing of consultation
26.—(1) With respect to any requirement which requires the undertaker to consult another party (“the consultee”), the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (2), provide the consultee with not less than 28 days beginning with the start date to respond to the consultation.
(2) If no later than the expiry of 21 days beginning with the start date, a consultee requests more time to respond to the consultation than was given under paragraph (1), the undertaker may consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to an extension of that period so that the consultee has a longer period to respond (such period to be not less than 42 days but no more than 56 days, beginning with the start date).
(3) In this paragraph, “the start date” is the day following the date on which the consultee received the document being consulted on.
Details of consultation
27.—(1) With respect to any requirement which requires details to be submitted to the Secretary of State for approval under this Schedule following consultation with another party, the details submitted must be accompanied by—

copies of all consultation responses received.
(2) At the time of submission to the Secretary of State for approval, the undertaker must provide a copy of the summary report referred to under sub-paragraph (1) to the relevant consultees referred to in the requirement in relation to which approval is being sought from the Secretary of State.
(3) The undertaker must ensure that any consultation responses are reflected in the details submitted to the Secretary of State for approval under this Schedule, but only where it is appropriate, reasonable and feasible to do so, taking into account considerations including, but not limited to, cost and engineering practicality.
(4) Where the consultation responses are not reflected in the details submitted to the Secretary of State for approval, the undertaker must state in the summary report referred to under sub-paragraph (1), the reasons why the consultation responses have not been reflected in the submitted details.

SCHEDULE 6
MODIFICATION OF COMPENSATION AND COMPULSORY PURCHASE ENACTMENTS FOR CREATION OF NEW RIGHTS AND IMPOSITION OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS
Compensation enactments
1.  The enactments for the time being in force with respect to compensation for the compulsory purchase of land apply, with the necessary modifications as respects compensation, in the case of a compulsory acquisition under this Order of a right by the creation of a new right or imposition of a restrictive covenant as they apply in respect of compensation on the compulsory purchase of land and interests in land.
2.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the 1961 Act has effect subject to the modification set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) For section 5A(5A) (relevant valuation date) of the 1961 Act substitute—
“(5A) If—
(a)
the acquiring authority enters on land for the purposes of exercising a right in pursuance of a notice of entry under section 11(1) of the 1965 Act (as modified by paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 6 (modification of compensation and compulsory purchase enactments for creation of new rights and imposition of restrictive covenants) to the A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening Development Consent Order 2024 (“the A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening Order”));
(b)
the acquiring authority is subsequently required by a determination under paragraph 12 of Schedule 2A to the 1965 Act (as substituted by paragraph 5(8) of Schedule 6 to the A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening Order 2024) to acquire an interest in the land; and
(c)
the acquiring authority enter on and take possession of that land,
the authority is deemed for the purposes of subsection (3)(a) to have entered on that land when it entered on that land for the purpose of exercising that right.”.
3.—(1) Without limitation on the scope of paragraph 1, the Land Compensation Act 1973(1) has effect subject to the modifications set out in sub-paragraph (2).
(2) In section 44(1) (compensation for injurious affection), as it applies to compensation for injurious affection under section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act as substituted by paragraph 5(3)—
(a)
for “land is acquired or taken from” substitute “a right or restrictive covenant over land is purchased from or imposed on”; and
(b)
for “acquired or taken from him” substitute “over which the right is exercisable or the restrictive covenant enforceable”.
Application of Part 1 of the 1965 Act
4.  Part 1 (compulsory purchase under Acquisition of Land Act 1946) of the 1965 Act, as applied by section 125 (application of compulsory acquisition provisions) of the 2008 Act (and modified by article 36 (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act)) to the acquisition of land under article 27 (compulsory acquisition of land), applies to the compulsory acquisition of a right by the creation of a new right, or to the imposition of a restrictive covenant under article 30(1) (compulsory acquisition of rights and imposition of restrictive covenants)—
(a)
with the modifications specified in paragraph 5; and
(b)
with such other modifications as may be necessary.
5.—(1) The modifications referred to in paragraph 4(a) are as follows.
(2) References in the 1965 Act to land are, in the appropriate contexts, to be read (according to the requirements of the particular context) as referring to, or as including references to—
(a)
the right acquired or to be acquired, or the restrictive covenant imposed or to be imposed; or
(b)
the land over which the right is or is to be exercisable, or the restriction is or is to be enforceable.
(3) For Section 7 (measure of compensation in case of severance) of the 1965 Act substitute—
“7.  In assessing the compensation to be paid by the acquiring authority under this Act, regard must be had not only to the extent (if any) to which the value of the land over which the right is to be acquired or the restrictive covenant is to be imposed is depreciated by the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant but also to the damage (if any) to be sustained by the owner of the land by reason of its severance from other land of the owner, or injuriously affecting that other land by the exercise of the powers conferred by this or the Special Act.”.
(4) The following provisions of the 1965 Act which state the effect of a deed poll executed in various circumstances where there is no conveyance by persons with interests in the land), that is to say—
(a)
section 9(4) (failure by owners to convey);
(b)
paragraph 10(3) of Schedule 1 (owners under incapacity);
(c)
paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 (absent and untraced owners); and
(d)
paragraphs 2(3) and 7(2) of Schedule 4 (common land),
are modified so as to secure that, as against persons with interests in the land which are expressed to be overridden by the deed, the right which is to be compulsorily acquired or the restrictive covenant which is to be imposed is vested absolutely in the acquiring authority.
(5) Section 11(2) (powers of entry) of the 1965 Act is modified so as to secure that, where the acquiring authority has served notice to treat in respect of any right or restrictive covenant, as well as the notice of entry required by subsection (1) of that section (as it applies to a compulsory acquisition under article 27 (compulsory acquisition of land)), it has power, exercisable in equivalent circumstances and subject to equivalent conditions, to enter for the purpose of exercising that right or enforcing that restrictive covenant; and sections 11A(3) (powers of entry: further notices of entry), 11B(4) (counter-notice requiring possession to be taken on specified date), 12(5) (unauthorised entry) and 13(6) (refusal to give possession to acquiring authority) of the 1965 Act are modified correspondingly.
(6) Section 20(7) (tenants at will, etc.) of the 1965 Act applies with the modifications necessary to secure that persons with such interests in land as are mentioned in that section are compensated in a manner corresponding to that in which they would be compensated on a compulsory acquisition under this Order of that land, but taking into account only the extent (if any) of such interference with such an interest as is actually caused, or likely to be caused, by the exercise of the right or the enforcement of the restrictive covenant in question.
(7) Section 22 (interests omitted from purchase) of the 1965 Act as modified by article 36(4) (modification of Part 1 of the 1965 Act) is also modified so as to enable the acquiring authority in circumstances corresponding to those referred to in that section, to continue to be entitled to exercise the right acquired, subject to compliance with that section as respects compensation.
(8) For Schedule 2A of the 1965 Act substitute—
“SCHEDULE 2A
COUNTER-NOTICE REQUIRING PURCHASE OF LAND NOT IN NOTICE TO TREAT
Introduction
1.—(1) This Schedule applies where an undertaker serves a notice to treat in respect of a right over, or a restrictive covenant affecting, the whole or part of a house, building or factory and has not executed a general vesting declaration under section 4 of the Compulsory Purchase (Vesting Declarations) Act 1981 as applied by article 37(5) (application of the 1981 Act) of the A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening Development Consent Order 2024 in respect of the land to which the notice to treat relates.
(2) But see article 38(3) (acquisition of subsoil or airspace only) of the A12 Chelmsford to A120 Widening Development Consent Order 2024 which excludes the acquisition of subsoil or airspace only from this Schedule.
2.  In this Schedule, “house” includes any park or garden belonging to a house.
Counter-notice requiring purchase of land
3.  A person who is able to sell the house, building or factory (“the owner”) may serve a counter-notice requiring the acquiring authority to purchase the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
4.  A counter-notice under paragraph 3 must be served within the period of 28 days beginning with the day on which the notice to treat was served.
Response to counter-notice
5.  On receiving a counter-notice, the acquiring authority must decide whether to—
(a)
withdraw the notice to treat,
(b)
accept the counter-notice, or
(c)
refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal.
6.  The acquiring authority must serve notice of their decision on the owner within the period of 3 months beginning with the day on which the counter-notice is served (“the decision period”).
7.  If the acquiring authority decides to refer the counter-notice to the Upper Tribunal it must do so within the decision period.
8.  If the acquiring authority does not serve notice of a decision within the decision period it is to be treated as if it had served notice of a decision to withdraw the notice to treat at the end of that period.
9.  If the acquiring authority serves notice of a decision to accept the counter-notice, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in the house, building or factory.
Determination by the Upper Tribunal
10.  On a referral under paragraph 7, the Upper Tribunal must determine whether the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the restrictive covenant would—
(a)
in the case of a house, building or factory, cause material detriment to the house, building or factory, or
(b)
in the case of a park or garden, seriously affect the amenity or convenience of the house to which the park or garden belongs.
11.  In making the determination, the Upper Tribunal must take into account—
(a)
the effect of the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant,
(b)
the use to be made of the right or covenant proposed to be acquired or imposed, and
(c)
if the right or covenant is proposed to be acquired or imposed for works or other purposes extending to other land, the effect of the whole of the works and the use of the other land.
12.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquisition of the right or the imposition of the covenant would have either of the consequences described in paragraph 10, it must determine how much of the house, building or factory the acquiring authority ought to be required to take.
13.  If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the compulsory purchase order and the notice to treat are to have effect as if they included the owner’s interest in that land.
14.—(1) If the Upper Tribunal determines that the acquiring authority ought to be required to take some or all of the house, building or factory, the acquiring authority may at any time within the period of 6 weeks beginning with the day on which the Upper Tribunal makes it determination withdraw the notice to treat in relation to that land.
(2) If the acquiring authority withdraws the notice to treat under this paragraph it must pay the person on whom the notice was served compensation for any loss or expense caused by the giving and withdrawing of the notice.
15.  Any dispute as to the compensation is to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.”.

SCHEDULE 11
PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS
PART 1
FOR THE PROTECTION OF ELECTRICITY, GAS, WATER AND SEWERAGE UNDERTAKERS
1.  For the protection of the utility undertakers referred to in this Part of this Schedule the following provisions have effect, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and the utility undertaker concerned.
2.  In this Part of this Schedule—
“alternative apparatus” means alternative apparatus adequate to enable the utility undertaker in question to fulfil its statutory functions in a manner no less efficient than previously;
“apparatus” means—
(a)
in the case of an electricity undertaker, electric lines or electrical plant (as defined in the Electricity Act 1989(1), belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker;
(b)
in that case of a gas undertaker, any mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 of the Gas Act 1986(2) for the purposes of gas supply;
(c)
in the case of water undertaker, mains, pipes or other apparatus belonging to or maintained by that utility undertaker for the purposes of water supply; and
(d)
in the case of a sewerage undertaker—
(i)
any drain or works vested in the utility undertaker under the Water Industry Act 1991(3); and
(ii)
any sewer which is so vested or is the subject of a notice of intention to adopt given under section 102(4)(4) (adoption of sewers and disposal works) of that Act or an agreement to adopt made under section 104 (agreement to adopt sewers, drains or sewage disposal works at future date) of that Act(5),
and includes a sludge main, disposal main (within the meaning of section 219 (general interpretation) of that Act or sewer outfall and any manholes, ventilating shafts, pumps or other accessories forming part of any such sewer, drain or works,
and includes any structure in which apparatus is or is to be lodged or which gives or will give access to apparatus;
“functions” includes powers and duties;
“in” in a context referring to apparatus or alternative apparatus in land includes a reference to apparatus or alternative apparatus under, over or upon land;
“plan” includes all designs, drawings, specifications, method statements, soil reports, programmes, calculations, risk assessments and other documents that are reasonably necessary properly and sufficiently to describe the works to be executed; and
“utility undertaker” means—
(a)
any licence holder within the meaning of Part 1 (electricity supply) of the Electricity Act 1989;
(b)
a gas transporter within the meaning of Part 1 (gas supply) of the Gas Act 1986;
(c)
a water undertaker within the meaning of the Water Industry Act 1991; and
(d)
a sewerage undertaker within the meaning of Part 1 (preliminary) of the Water Industry Act 1991,
for the area of the authorised development, and in relation to any apparatus, means the utility undertaker to whom it belongs or by whom it is maintained.
On street apparatus
3.  This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and the utility undertaker are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus in stopped up streets
4.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 19 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access), any utility undertaker whose apparatus is in the street has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to the utility undertaker legal easements reasonably satisfactory to the utility undertaker in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of the utility undertaker to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 7 or the power of the undertaker to carry out works under paragraph 9.
(2) Regardless of the temporary alteration, diversion, prohibition and restriction of the use of streets under the powers conferred by article 18 (temporary alteration, diversion, prohibition and restriction of the use of streets), a utility undertaker is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
5.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 25 (protective work to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
Acquisition of land
6.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
7.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that the utility undertaker’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of a utility undertaker to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker in question in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (7).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to the utility undertaker in question 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order a utility undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3) afford to the utility undertaker the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, the utility undertaker in question must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between the utility undertaker in question and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration).
(5) The utility undertaker in question must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration), and after the grant to the utility undertaker of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if the undertaker gives notice in writing to the utility undertaker in question that the undertaker desires itself to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, that work, instead of being executed by the utility undertaker, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of the utility undertaker.
(7) Nothing in sub-paragraph (6) authorises the undertaker to execute the placing, installation, bedding, packing, removal, connection or disconnection of any apparatus, or execute any filling around the apparatus (where the apparatus is laid in a trench) within 300 millimetres of the apparatus.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
8.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to a utility undertaker facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and the utility undertaker in question or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to the utility undertaker in question than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to that utility undertaker as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus
9.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2), the undertaker must submit to the utility undertaker in question a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by the utility undertaker for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and the utility undertaker is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by a utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (2) are to be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If a utility undertaker, in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 1 to 3 and 6 to 8 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 7(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case it must give to the utility undertaker in question notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(7) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres measured in any direction of any electricity apparatus, or involve embankment works within 10 metres of any electricity apparatus, the plan to be submitted to the utility undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) must be detailed, include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which they are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal;
(d)
the position of all electricity apparatus; and
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to such apparatus.
Expenses and costs
10.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to a utility undertaker all expenses reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in paragraph 7(2).
(2) The value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1), that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to the utility undertaker in question by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus must not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole must be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to a utility undertaker in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on the utility undertaker any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
11.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 5 or 7(2) any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of a utility undertaker, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by any utility undertaker, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by that utility undertaker in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to that utility undertaker for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the utility undertaker,
by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by a utility undertaker on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by a utility undertaker or in accordance with any requirement of a utility undertaker or under its supervision does not, subject to subparagraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1).
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of a utility undertaker, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) A utility undertaker must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made without the consent of the undertaker and, if such consent is withheld, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

Apparatus in stopped up streets
22.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 19 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access), where Anglian Water has apparatus in the street or accessed by virtue of that street, it has the same powers and rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to Anglian Water legal easements reasonably satisfactory to Anglian Water in respect of such apparatus and access to it, but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or of Anglian Water to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 25 or the power of the undertaker to carry out works under paragraph 27.
(2) Regardless of the temporary alteration, diversion or prohibition of the use of or restriction of the use of any highway under the powers conferred by article 18 (temporary alteration, diversion, prohibition and restriction of the use of streets), Anglian Water is at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such altered, diverted, prohibited or restricted highway and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such highway as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the alteration, diversion or prohibition of use of or restriction of use was in that highway.
Protective works to buildings
23.  The undertaker, in the case of the powers conferred by article 25 (protective work to buildings), must exercise those powers so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus.
Acquisition of land
24.  Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker must not acquire any apparatus otherwise than by agreement.
Removal of apparatus
25.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed or requires that Anglian Water’s apparatus is relocated or diverted, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule, and any right of Anglian Water to maintain that apparatus in that land must not (without the prior written consent of Anglian Water) be extinguished, until—
(a)
alternative apparatus has been constructed and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (8); and
(b)
facilities and rights have been secured for that alternative apparatus in accordance with paragraph 26.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, the undertaker must give to Anglian Water 28 days’ written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order an undertaker reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to Anglian Water the necessary facilities and rights for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of the undertaker and subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed Anglian Water must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, as soon as reasonably possible use its best endeavours to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Anglian Water and the undertaker or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration).
(5) Anglian Water must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed or settled by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration), and after the grant to Anglian Water of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraphs (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
(6) Regardless of anything in sub-paragraph (5), if Anglian Water gives notice in writing to the undertaker that it desires the undertaker to execute any work, or part of any work in connection with the construction or removal of apparatus in any land of the undertaker, or to the extent that Anglian Water fails to proceed with that work in accordance with sub-paragraph (5) or the undertaker and Anglian Water otherwise agree, that work, instead of being executed by Anglian Water, must be executed by the undertaker without unnecessary delay under the superintendence, if given, and to the reasonable satisfaction of Anglian Water.
(7) Notice under sub-paragraph (6) that Anglian Water desires the undertaker to execute any work, or part of any work, must be given within 14 days of agreement under sub-paragraph (4) or, in default of agreement, within 14 days of the date of settlement by arbitration under sub-paragraph (4).
(8) If Anglian Water fails either reasonably to approve, or to provide reasons for its failure to approve along with an indication of what would be required to make acceptable, any proposed details relating to required removal works under sub-paragraph (2) within 28 days of receiving a notice of the required works from the undertaker, then such details are deemed to have been approved. For the avoidance of doubt, any such “deemed consent” does not extend to the actual undertaking of the removal works, which shall remain the sole responsibility of Anglian Water or its contractors.
(9) Whenever alternative apparatus is to be or is being substituted for existing apparatus, the undertaker shall, before taking or requiring any further step in such substitution works, use best endeavours to comply with Anglian Water’s reasonable requests for a reasonable period of time to enable Anglian Water to—
(a)
make network contingency arrangements; or
(b)
bring such matters as it may consider reasonably necessary to the attention of end users of the utility in question.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
26.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to Anglian Water facilities and rights for the construction and maintenance in land of the undertaker of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights are to be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Anglian Water or in default of agreement settled by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration).
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are in the opinion of the arbitrator less favourable on the whole to Anglian Water than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Anglian Water as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
(3) Such facilities and rights as are set out in this paragraph are deemed to include any statutory permits granted to the undertaker in respect of the apparatus in question, whether under the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2016(11) or other legislation.
Retained apparatus
27.—(1) Not less than 28 days before starting the execution of any works in, on or under any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order that are near to, or will or may affect, any apparatus (or any means of access to it) the removal of which has not been required by the undertaker under paragraph 25(2), the undertaker must submit to Anglian Water a plan of the works to be executed.
(2) Those works must be executed only in accordance with the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) by Anglian Water for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and Anglian Water is entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(3) Any requirements made by Anglian Water under sub-paragraph (2) must be made within a period of 21 days beginning with the date on which a plan under sub-paragraph (1) is submitted to it.
(4) If Anglian Water, in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) and (6) to (7) apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 25(2).
(5) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 28 days before commencing the execution of any works, a new plan instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(6) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) in a case of emergency but in that case must give to Anglian Water notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works as soon as reasonably practicable subsequently and must comply with sub-paragraph (3) in so far as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances and will keep the impact of those emergency works on Anglian Water’s apparatus, on the operation of its water and sewerage network and on end-users of the services Anglian Water provides to a minimum.
(7) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), works are deemed to be in land near Anglian Water’s apparatus (where it is a pipe) if those works fall within the following distances measured from the medial line of such apparatus—
(a)
2.25 metres where the diameter of the pipe is less than 150 millimetres;
(b)
3 metres where the diameter of the pipe is between 150 and 450 millimetres;
(c)
4.5 metres where the diameter of the pipe is between 451 and 750 millimetres; and
(d)
6 metres where the diameter of the pipe exceeds 750 millimetres.
Expenses and costs
28.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must repay to Anglian Water all expenses reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any such works as are referred to in this Part of the Schedule.
(2) There must be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated, and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Anglian Water by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) must be reduced by the amount of that excess.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus is not to be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole is to be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Anglian Water in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1), if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Anglian Water any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, is to be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
29.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works referred to in paragraphs 23 or 25(2), or by reason of any subsidence resulting from such development or works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of those works) or property of Anglian Water, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Anglian Water, the undertaker must—
(a)
bear and pay the cost reasonably incurred by Anglian Water in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
make reasonable compensation to Anglian Water for any other expenses, loss, damages, penalty or costs incurred by the undertaker, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Anglian Water on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Anglian Water or in accordance with any requirement of Anglian Water or under its supervision does not, subject to sub-paragraph (3), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of sub-paragraph (1) unless Anglian Water fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and professional like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the act, neglect or default of Anglian Water, its officers, servants, contractors or agents.
(4) Anglian Water must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise is to be made, without the consent of the undertaker (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) who, if withholding such consent, has the sole conduct of any settlement or compromise or of any proceedings necessary to resist the claim or demand.

Except for paragraphs 37 (apparatus of National Grid in stopped up streets), 42 (retained apparatus: protection of electricity undertaker), 43 (expenses) and 44 (indemnity) which will apply in respect of the exercise of all or any powers under the Order affecting the rights and apparatus of National Grid, the other provisions of this Part of this Schedule do not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and National Grid are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
Apparatus of National Grid in stopped up streets
37.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 19 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access), if National Grid has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street National Grid has the same rights in respect of that apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to National Grid, or procure the granting to National Grid of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to National Grid in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up of any such street but nothing in this paragraph affects any right of the undertaker or National Grid to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 40 or the power of the undertaker, subject to compliance with this sub-paragraph, to carry out works under paragraph 42.
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary alteration, diversion or restriction of any highway under the powers of article 18 (temporary alteration, diversion, prohibition and restriction of the use of streets), National Grid will be at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such stopped up street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to enable it to maintain any apparatus which at the time of the alteration, diversion or restriction was in that street.
Protective works to buildings
38.  The undertaker must exercise the powers conferred by article 25 (protective work to buildings) so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of National Grid (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
Acquisition of land
39.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans, the undertaker may not acquire any interest in land or apparatus or override any easement or other interest of National Grid otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of an agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out of any part of the authorised works (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of National Grid or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between National Grid and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as National Grid reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid unless otherwise agreed by National Grid, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure and secure the consent and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised works.
(3) The undertaker and National Grid agree that where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus (including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus) and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by National Grid or other enactments relied upon by National Grid as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Part of this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by National Grid under paragraph 42 or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
Removal of apparatus
40.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, the undertaker acquires any interest in or possesses temporarily any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of National Grid to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, and is in operation to the reasonable satisfaction of National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5).
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to National Grid advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order National Grid reasonably needs to remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must, subject to sub-paragraph (3), afford to National Grid to its reasonable satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 41(1)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus in other land of, or secured by, the undertaker; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If alternative apparatus or any part of such apparatus is to be constructed elsewhere than in other land of or land secured by the undertaker, or the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, National Grid must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to obtain the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for National Grid to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between National Grid and the undertaker.
(5) National Grid must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the grant to National Grid of any such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
41.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for National Grid facilities and rights in land for the construction, use, maintenance and protection of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and National Grid and must be no less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed unless otherwise agreed by National Grid.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) above in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to National Grid than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be removed and the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject, the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 48 (arbitration) and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to National Grid as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of electricity undertaker
42.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to National Grid a plan of the works to be executed and seek from National Grid details of the underground extent of their electricity tower foundations.
(2) In relation to works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within (i) 15 metres measured in any direction of any apparatus, or (ii) involve embankment works within 15 metres of any apparatus, the plan to be submitted to National Grid under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus;
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes; and
(g)
an assessment of risks of rise of earth issues.
(3) In relation to any works which will or may be situated on, over, under or within 10 metres of any part of the foundations of an electricity tower or between any two or more electricity towers, the plan to be submitted under sub-paragraph (1) must, in addition to the matters set out in sub-paragraph (2), include a method statement describing—
(a)
details of any cable trench design including route, dimensions, clearance to pylon foundations;
(b)
demonstration that pylon foundations will not be affected prior to, during and post construction;
(c)
details of load bearing capacities of trenches;
(d)
details of any cable installation methodology including access arrangements, jointing bays and backfill methodology;
(e)
a written management plan for high voltage hazard during construction and ongoing maintenance of any cable route;
(f)
written details of the operations and maintenance regime for any cable, including frequency and method of access;
(g)
assessment of earth rise potential if reasonably required by National Grid’s engineers; and
(h)
evidence that trench bearing capacity is to be designed to support overhead line construction traffic of up to 26 tonnes in weight.
(4) The undertaker must not commence any works to which sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) apply until National Grid has given written approval of the plan so submitted.
(5) Any approval of National Grid required under sub-paragraph (4)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraphs (6) or (8); and,
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld.
(6) In relation to any work to which sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) apply, National Grid may require such modifications to be made to the plans as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage, for the provision of protective works or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(7) Works executed under sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) must be executed in accordance with the plan, submitted under sub-paragraph (1) or as relevant sub-paragraph (6), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and National Grid and in accordance with such reasonable requirements as may be made in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) or (8) by National Grid for the alteration or otherwise for the protection of the apparatus, or for securing access to it, and National Grid will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(8) Where under sub-paragraph (6) National Grid requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to National Grid’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works for which protective works are required and National Grid must give notice of its requirement for such works within 42 days of the date of submission of a plan pursuant to this paragraph (except in an emergency).
(9) If National Grid in accordance with sub-paragraphs (6) or (8) and in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 34 to 36 and 39 to 41 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 40(2).
(10) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan, instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph apply to and in respect of the new plan.
(11) The undertaker will not be required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to National Grid notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with sub-paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(12) In sub-paragraph (11) “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to or to prevent the occurrence of circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works believes on reasonable grounds to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.
Expenses
43.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to National Grid within 30 days of receipt of an itemised invoice or claim from National Grid all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated within the following three months or reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised works including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by National Grid in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs incurred by National Grid as a consequence of National Grid—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 40(3); or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers in the Order transferred to or benefitting National Grid;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus, where no written diversion agreement is otherwise in place;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule.
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 48 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) Any amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to National Grid in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on National Grid any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
44.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any works authorised by this Part of this Schedule or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised works by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by him) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised works) or property of National Grid, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by National Grid, or National Grid becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from National Grid the cost reasonably and properly incurred by National Grid in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify National Grid for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty or costs incurred by or recovered from National Grid, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or National Grid becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of National Grid.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by National Grid on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by National Grid or in accordance with any requirement of National Grid or under its supervision will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies), excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless National Grid fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of National Grid, its officers, servants, contractors or agents;
(b)
any part of the authorised works carried out by National Grid in the exercise of any functions conferred by this Order pursuant to a grant or transfer under article 11 (consent to transfer benefit of Order).
(4) National Grid must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
(5) National Grid must, in respect of any matter covered by the indemnity given by the undertaker in this paragraph, at all times act reasonably and in the same manner as it would as if settling third party claims on its own behalf from its own funds.
(6) National Grid must use its reasonable endeavours to mitigate and to minimise any costs, expenses, loss, demands, and penalties to which the indemnity under this paragraph applies where it is within National Grid’s reasonable ability and control to do so and which expressly excludes any obligation to mitigate liability arising from third parties which is outside of National Grid’s control and if reasonably requested to do so by the undertaker National Grid must provide an explanation of how the claim has been minimised, where relevant.
Enactments and agreements
45.  Nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and National Grid in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
46.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised works, the undertaker or National Grid requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 40(2) or National Grid makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 42(9), the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised works and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of National Grid’s undertaking and National Grid must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever the undertaker’s or National Grid’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted under this schedule, or agreement is required to be reached between the parties under this Part of this Schedule, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
47.  If in consequence of the agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 39(1) or the powers granted under this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative means of access to such apparatus as will enable National Grid to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
48.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 40(2), 40(4) and 41(1), any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and National Grid under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and National Grid, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration).
Notice
49.  Notwithstanding article 60 (service of notices), any plans submitted to National Grid by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 42 must be sent to https://lsbud.co.uk/ and National Grid Plant Protection at plantprotection@nationalgrid.com or such other address as National Grid may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker in writing.

On street apparatus
52.—(1) This Part of this Schedule does not apply to apparatus in respect of which the relations between the undertaker and Cadent are regulated by the provisions of Part 3 (street works in England and Wales) of the 1991 Act, except for—
(a)
paragraphs 53 (apparatus of Cadent in stopped up streets), 58(2) (retained apparatus: protection of Cadent), 59 (expenses) and 60 (indemnity); and
(b)
where sub-paragraph (2) applies, paragraphs 56 (removal of apparatus) and 57 (facilities and rights for alternative apparatus).
(2) This sub-paragraph applies where any apparatus is diverted from an alignment within the existing adopted public highway but not wholly replaced within the existing adopted public highway, notwithstanding that any diversion may be carried out under the provisions of Part 3 of the 1991 Act.
(3) Paragraph 59 (expenses) does not apply where the authorised development constitutes major highway works, major bridge works or major transport works for the purposes of Part 3 of the 1991 Act, but instead—
(a)
the allowable costs of the relocation works are to be determined in accordance with section 85 (sharing of cost of necessary measures) of that Act and any regulations for the time being having effect under that section; and
(b)
the allowable costs are to be borne by the undertaker and Cadent in such proportions as may be prescribed by any such regulations.
Apparatus of Cadent in stopped up streets
53.—(1) Where any street is stopped up under article 19 (permanent stopping up and restriction of use of streets and private means of access), if Cadent has any apparatus in the street or accessed via that street Cadent is entitled to the same rights in respect of such apparatus as it enjoyed immediately before the stopping up and the undertaker must grant to Cadent, or procure the granting to Cadent of, legal easements reasonably satisfactory to Cadent in respect of such apparatus and access to it prior to the stopping up of any such street or highway, but nothing in this paragraph shall affect any right of the undertaker or of Cadent to require the removal of that apparatus under paragraph 56 (removal of apparatus).
(2) Notwithstanding the temporary alteration, diversion or restriction of use of any street under the powers of article 18 (temporary alteration, diversion, prohibition and restriction of the use of streets), Cadent will be at liberty at all times to take all necessary access across any such street and to execute and do all such works and things in, upon or under any such street as it would have been entitled to do immediately before such temporary alteration, diversion or restriction of use in respect of any apparatus which at the time of the stopping up or diversion was in that street.
Protective works to buildings
54.  The undertaker must exercise the powers conferred by article 25 (protective work to buildings) so as not to obstruct or render less convenient the access to any apparatus without the written consent of Cadent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
Acquisition of land
55.—(1) Regardless of any provision in this Order or anything shown on the land plans or contained in the book of reference to the Order, the undertaker may not appropriate or acquire any interest in land or appropriate, acquire, extinguish, interfere with or override any easement or other interest in land of Cadent otherwise than by agreement.
(2) As a condition of agreement between the parties in sub-paragraph (1), prior to the carrying out or maintenance of any part of the authorised development (or in such other timeframe as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker) that is subject to the requirements of this Part of this Schedule that will cause any conflict with or breach the terms of any easement or other legal or land interest of Cadent or affect the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between Cadent and the undertaker in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to or secured by the undertaker, the undertaker must as Cadent reasonably requires enter into such deeds of consent upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker acting reasonably and which must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent unless otherwise agreed by Cadent, and it will be the responsibility of the undertaker to procure or secure the consent to and entering into of such deeds and variations by all other third parties with an interest in the land at that time who are affected by such authorised development or maintenance thereof.
(3) Where there is any inconsistency or duplication between the provisions set out in this Part of this Schedule relating to the relocation or removal of apparatus, including but not limited to the payment of costs and expenses relating to such relocation or removal of apparatus and the provisions of any existing easement, rights, agreements and licences granted, used, enjoyed or exercised by Cadent and other enactments relied upon by Cadent as of right or other use in relation to the apparatus, then the provisions in this Part of this Schedule prevail.
(4) Any agreement or consent granted by Cadent under paragraph 58 (retained apparatus: protection of Cadent) or any other paragraph of this Part of this Schedule, is not to be taken to constitute agreement under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) As a condition of an agreement under sub-paragraph (1) that involves de-commissioned apparatus being left in situ the undertaker must accept a surrender of any existing easement or other interest of Cadent in such decommissioned apparatus and release Cadent from all liabilities in respect of such de-commissioned apparatus from the date of such surrender.
(6) Where an undertaker acquires land which is subject to any Cadent right or interest (including, without limitation, easements and agreements relating to rights or other interests) and the provisions of paragraph 56 (removal of apparatus) do not apply, the undertaker must, unless Cadent agrees otherwise—
(a)
retain any notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest on the title to the relevant land when registering the undertaker’s title to such acquired land; and
(b)
(where no such notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest exists in relation to such acquired land or any such notice is registered only on the Land Charges Register) include (with its application to register title to the undertaker’s interest in such acquired land at the Land Registry) a notice of Cadent’s easement, right or other interest in relation to such acquired land.
Removal of apparatus
56.—(1) If, in the exercise of the powers conferred by this Order, including pursuant to any agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 55 (acquisition of land), the undertaker acquires any interest in any land in which any apparatus is placed, that apparatus must not be decommissioned or removed under this Part of this Schedule and any right of Cadent to maintain that apparatus in that land must not be extinguished until alternative apparatus has been constructed, is in operation, and the facilities and rights referred to in sub-paragraph (2) have been provided, to the reasonable satisfaction of Cadent and in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) to (5) inclusive.
(2) If, for the purpose of executing any works in, on, under or over any land purchased, held, appropriated or used under this Order, the undertaker requires the removal of any apparatus placed in that land, it must give to Cadent advance written notice of that requirement, together with a plan and section of the work proposed, and of the proposed position of the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed and in that case (or if in consequence of the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Order Cadent reasonably needs to move or remove any of its apparatus) the undertaker must afford to Cadent to its satisfaction (taking into account paragraph 57(1) (facilities and rights for alternative apparatus)) the necessary facilities and rights—
(a)
for the construction of alternative apparatus; and
(b)
subsequently for the maintenance of that apparatus.
(3) If the undertaker is unable to afford such facilities and rights as are mentioned in sub-paragraph (2), in the land in which the alternative apparatus or part of such apparatus is to be constructed, Cadent must, on receipt of a written notice to that effect from the undertaker, take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances in an endeavour to assist the undertaker in obtaining the necessary facilities and rights in the land in which the alternative apparatus is to be constructed save that this obligation does not extend to the requirement for Cadent to use its compulsory purchase powers to this end unless it (in its absolute discretion) elects to so do.
(4) Any alternative apparatus to be constructed in land of or land secured by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule must be constructed in such manner and in such line or situation as may be agreed between Cadent and the undertaker.
(5) Cadent must, after the alternative apparatus to be provided or constructed has been agreed, and subject to the prior grant to Cadent of such facilities and rights as are referred to in sub-paragraph (2) or (3), then proceed without unnecessary delay to construct and bring into operation the alternative apparatus and subsequently to decommission or remove any apparatus required by the undertaker to be decommissioned or removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule.
Facilities and rights for alternative apparatus
57.—(1) Where, in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule, the undertaker affords to or secures for Cadent facilities and rights in land for the access to, construction and maintenance of alternative apparatus in substitution for apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, those facilities and rights must be granted upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the undertaker and Cadent and must be no less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed unless otherwise agreed by Cadent.
(2) If the facilities and rights to be afforded by the undertaker and agreed with Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) in respect of any alternative apparatus, and the terms and conditions subject to which those facilities and rights are to be granted, are less favourable on the whole to Cadent than the facilities and rights enjoyed by it in respect of the apparatus to be decommissioned or removed, then the terms and conditions to which those facilities and rights are subject in the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 64 (arbitration) and the arbitrator must make such provision for the payment of compensation by the undertaker to Cadent as appears to the arbitrator to be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.
Retained apparatus: protection of Cadent
58.—(1) Not less than 56 days before the commencement of any specified works the undertaker must submit to Cadent a plan and, if reasonably required by Cadent, a ground monitoring scheme in respect of those works.
(2) The plan to be submitted to Cadent under sub-paragraph (1) must include a method statement and describe—
(a)
the exact position of the works;
(b)
the level at which these are proposed to be constructed or renewed;
(c)
the manner of their construction or renewal including details of excavation, positioning of plant etc.;
(d)
the position of all apparatus;
(e)
by way of detailed drawings, every alteration proposed to be made to or close to any such apparatus; and
(f)
any intended maintenance regimes.
(3) The undertaker must not commence any specified works until Cadent has given written approval of the plan so submitted (and the ground monitoring scheme if required).
(4) Any approval of Cadent given under sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
may be given subject to reasonable conditions for any purpose mentioned in sub-paragraph (5); and
(b)
must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and Cadent must meaningfully engage with the undertaker within 28 days of the date of submission of the plan under sub-paragraph (1).
(5) Cadent may require such modifications to be made to the plan as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of securing its apparatus against interference or risk of damage or for the purpose of providing or securing proper and convenient means of access to any apparatus.
(6) Specified works must only be executed in accordance with—
(a)
the plan submitted under sub-paragraph (1) (and ground monitoring scheme if required), as approved or as amended from time to time by agreement between the undertaker and Cadent; and
(b)
all conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a), and Cadent will be entitled to watch and inspect the execution of those works.
(7) Where Cadent requires any protective works to be carried out by itself or by the undertaker (whether of a temporary or permanent nature) such protective works, inclusive of any measures or schemes required and approved as part of the plan approved pursuant to this paragraph, must be carried out to Cadent’s satisfaction prior to the commencement of any specified works (or any relevant part thereof) for which protective works are required prior to commencement.
(8) If Cadent, in consequence of the works proposed by the undertaker, reasonably requires the removal of any apparatus and gives written notice to the undertaker of that requirement, paragraphs 50 to 52 and 55 to 57 apply as if the removal of the apparatus had been required by the undertaker under paragraph 56(1) (removal of apparatus).
(9) Nothing in this paragraph precludes the undertaker from submitting at any time or from time to time, but in no case less than 56 days before commencing the execution of the specified works, a new plan (and ground monitoring scheme if required), instead of the plan previously submitted, and having done so the provisions of this paragraph will apply to and in respect of the new plan (and ground monitoring scheme if required).
(10) As soon as reasonably practicable after any ground subsidence event attributable to the authorised development (including such an event attributable to its maintenance)—
(a)
the undertaker must implement an appropriate ground mitigation scheme; and
(b)
Cadent retains the right to carry out any further necessary protective works for the safeguarding of its apparatus and can recover any such costs in line with paragraph 59 (expenses).
(11) The undertaker is not required to comply with sub-paragraph (1) where it needs to carry out emergency works but in that case it must give to Cadent notice as soon as is reasonably practicable and a plan of those works and must comply with the conditions imposed under sub-paragraph (4)(a) insofar as is reasonably practicable in the circumstances.
(12) In this paragraph, “emergency works” means works whose execution at the time when they are executed is required in order to put an end to, or to prevent the occurrence of, circumstances then existing or imminent (or which the person responsible for the works believes on reasonable grounds to be existing or imminent) which are likely to cause danger to persons or property.
Expenses
59.—(1) Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, the undertaker must pay to Cadent on demand, all charges, costs and expenses reasonably anticipated or reasonably incurred by Cadent in, or in connection with, the inspection, removal, relaying or replacing, alteration or protection of any apparatus or the construction of any new or alternative apparatus which may be required in consequence of the execution of any authorised development including without limitation—
(a)
any costs reasonably incurred by or compensation properly paid by Cadent in connection with the acquisition of rights or the exercise of statutory powers for such apparatus including without limitation all costs (including professional fees) incurred by Cadent as a consequence of Cadent—
(i)
using its own compulsory purchase powers to acquire any necessary rights under paragraph 56(1) (removal of apparatus) if it elects to do so; or
(ii)
exercising any compulsory purchase powers under this Order transferred to or benefitting Cadent;
(b)
in connection with the cost of the carrying out of any diversion work or the provision of any alternative apparatus;
(c)
the cutting off of any apparatus from any other apparatus or the making safe of redundant apparatus;
(d)
the approval of plans;
(e)
the carrying out of protective works, plus a capitalised sum to cover the cost of maintaining and renewing permanent protective works;
(f)
the survey of any land, apparatus or works, the inspection and monitoring of works or the installation or removal of any temporary works reasonably necessary in consequence of the execution of any such works referred to in this Part of this Schedule;
(g)
any watching brief pursuant to sub-paragraph 58(6) (retained apparatus: protection of Cadent).
(2) There will be deducted from any sum payable under sub-paragraph (1) the value of any apparatus removed under the provisions of this Part of this Schedule and which is not re-used as part of the alternative apparatus, that value being calculated after removal.
(3) If in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
apparatus of better type, of greater capacity or of greater dimensions is placed in substitution for existing apparatus of worse type, of smaller capacity or of smaller dimensions; or
(b)
apparatus (whether existing apparatus or apparatus substituted for existing apparatus) is placed at a depth greater than the depth at which the existing apparatus was situated,
and the placing of apparatus of that type or capacity or of those dimensions or the placing of apparatus at that depth, as the case may be, is not agreed by the undertaker or, in default of agreement, is not determined by arbitration in accordance with paragraph 64 (arbitration) to be necessary, then, if such placing involves cost in the construction of works under this Part of this Schedule exceeding that which would have been involved if the apparatus placed had been of the existing type, capacity or dimensions, or at the existing depth, as the case may be, the amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will be reduced by the amount of that excess save to the extent that it is not possible in the circumstances (or it would be unlawful due to a statutory or regulatory change) to obtain the existing type of apparatus at the same capacity and dimensions or place at the existing depth in which case full costs will be borne by the undertaker.
(4) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
an extension of apparatus to a length greater than the length of existing apparatus will not be treated as a placing of apparatus of greater dimensions than those of the existing apparatus; and
(b)
where the provision of a joint in a pipe or cable is agreed, or is determined to be necessary, the consequential provision of a jointing chamber or of a manhole will be treated as if it also had been agreed or had been so determined.
(5) An amount which apart from this sub-paragraph would be payable to Cadent in respect of works by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) will, if the works include the placing of apparatus provided in substitution for apparatus placed more than 7 years and 6 months earlier so as to confer on Cadent any financial benefit by deferment of the time for renewal of the apparatus in the ordinary course, be reduced by the amount which represents that benefit.
Indemnity
60.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), if by reason or in consequence of the construction of any such works authorised by this Part of this Schedule (including without limitation relocation, diversion, decommissioning, construction and maintenance of apparatus or alternative apparatus) or in consequence of the construction, use, maintenance or failure of any of the authorised development (including works carried out under article 25 (protective work to buildings)) by or on behalf of the undertaker or in consequence of any act or default of the undertaker (or any person employed or authorised by the undertaker) in the course of carrying out such works, including without limitation works carried out by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or any subsidence resulting from any of these works, any damage is caused to any apparatus or alternative apparatus (other than apparatus the repair of which is not reasonably necessary in view of its intended removal for the purposes of the authorised development) or property of Cadent, or there is any interruption in any service provided, or in the supply of any goods, by Cadent, or Cadent becomes liable to pay any amount to any third party, the undertaker will—
(a)
bear and pay on demand accompanied by an invoice or claim from Cadent, the cost reasonably incurred by Cadent in making good such damage or restoring the supply; and
(b)
indemnify Cadent for any other expenses, loss, demands, proceedings, damages, claims, penalty, compensation or costs properly incurred by, paid by or recovered from Cadent, by reason or in consequence of any such damage or interruption or Cadent becoming liable to any third party as aforesaid other than arising from any default of Cadent.
(2) The fact that any act or thing may have been done by Cadent on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with a plan approved by Cadent or in accordance with any requirement of Cadent or under its supervision including under any watching brief will not (unless sub-paragraph (3) applies) excuse the undertaker from liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph (1) unless Cadent fails to carry out and execute the works properly with due care and attention and in a skilful and workman like manner or in a manner that does not accord with the approved plan.
(3) Nothing in sub-paragraph (1) imposes any liability on the undertaker in respect of—
(a)
any damage or interruption to the extent that it is attributable to the neglect or default of Cadent, its officers, servants, contractors or agents; and
(b)
any part of the authorised development carried out by Cadent in the exercise of any functions conferred by this Order pursuant to a grant or transfer under article 11 (consent to transfer benefit of the Order).
(c)
any indirect or consequential loss of any third party (including but not limited to loss of use, revenue, profit, contract, production, increased cost of working or business interruption) arising from any such damage or interruption, which is not reasonably foreseeable at the commencement of the relevant works referred to in sub-paragraph (1).
(4) Cadent must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such third party claim or demand and no settlement, admission of liability or compromise must, unless payment is required in connection with a statutory compensation scheme, be made without first consulting the undertaker and considering their representations.
Enactments and agreements
61.  Except where this Part of this Schedule provides otherwise or by agreement in writing between Cadent and the undertaker, nothing in this Part of this Schedule affects the provisions of any enactment or agreement regulating the relations between the undertaker and Cadent in respect of any apparatus laid or erected in land belonging to the undertaker on the date on which this Order is made.
Co-operation
62.—(1) Where in consequence of the proposed construction of any part of the authorised development, the undertaker or Cadent requires the removal of apparatus under paragraph 56(2) (removal of apparatus) or Cadent makes requirements for the protection or alteration of apparatus under paragraph 58 (retained apparatus: protection of Cadent), the undertaker must use its best endeavours to co-ordinate the execution of the works in the interests of safety and the efficient and economic execution of the authorised development and taking into account the need to ensure the safe and efficient operation of Cadent’s undertaking and Cadent must use its best endeavours to co-operate with the undertaker for that purpose.
(2) For the avoidance of doubt whenever Cadent’s consent, agreement or approval is required in relation to plans, documents or other information submitted by Cadent or the taking of action by Cadent, it must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Access
63.  If in consequence of any agreement reached in accordance with paragraph 55(1) (acquisition of land) or the powers conferred by this Order the access to any apparatus is materially obstructed, the undertaker must provide such alternative rights and means of access to such apparatus as will enable Cadent to maintain or use the apparatus no less effectively than was possible before such obstruction.
Arbitration
64.  Save for differences or disputes arising under paragraph 56(2) and 56(4) (removal of apparatus) and 58(11) (retained apparatus: protection of Cadent) any difference or dispute arising between the undertaker and Cadent under this Part of this Schedule must, unless otherwise agreed in writing between the undertaker and Cadent, be determined by arbitration in accordance with article 61 (arbitration).
Notices
65.  Notwithstanding article 60 (service of notices) any plans submitted to Cadent by the undertaker pursuant to paragraph 58(1) (retained apparatus: protection of Cadent) must be sent by email to Cadent Gas Limited Plant Protection at plantprotection@cadentgas.com as well as by post to Plant Protection, Cadent Gas Limited, Brick Kiln Street, Hinckley, Leicestershire, LE10 0NA, or such other address as Cadent may from time to time appoint instead for that purpose and notify to the undertaker in writing.

(6) Where Network Rail is asked to give its consent pursuant to this paragraph, such consent must not be unreasonably withheld but may be given subject to reasonable conditions, but it is not unreasonable to withhold consent for reasons of operational or railway safety (such matters to be in Network Rail’s absolute discretion).
(7) The undertaker must enter into an asset protection agreement prior to the carrying out of any specified work.
70.—(1) The undertaker must before commencing construction of any specified work supply to Network Rail proper and sufficient plans of that work for the reasonable approval of the engineer and the specified work must not be commenced except in accordance with such plans as have been approved in writing by the engineer or settled by arbitration.
(2) The approval of the engineer under sub-paragraph (1) must not be unreasonably withheld, and if by the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which such plans have been supplied to Network Rail the engineer has not intimated their disapproval of those plans and the grounds of such disapproval the undertaker may serve upon the engineer written notice requiring the engineer to intimate approval or disapproval within a further period of 28 days beginning with the date upon which the engineer receives written notice from the undertaker. If by the expiry of the further 28 days the engineer has not intimated approval or disapproval, the engineer shall be deemed to have approved the plans as submitted.
(3) If by the end of the period of 28 days beginning with the date on which written notice was served upon the engineer under sub-paragraph (2), Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct any part of a specified work which in the opinion of the engineer will or may affect the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker desires such part of the specified work to be constructed, Network Rail must construct it without unnecessary delay on behalf of and to the reasonable satisfaction of the undertaker in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to be approved or settled under this paragraph, and under the supervision (where appropriate and if given) of the undertaker.
(4) When signifying their approval of the plans the engineer may specify any protective works (whether temporary or permanent) which in the engineer’s opinion should be carried out before the commencement of the construction of a specified work to ensure the safety or stability of railway property or the continuation of safe and efficient operation of the railways of Network Rail or the services of operators using the same (including any relocation de-commissioning and removal of works, apparatus and equipment necessitated by a specified work and the comfort and safety of passengers who may be affected by the specified works), and such protective works as may be reasonably necessary for those purposes must be constructed by Network Rail or by the undertaker, if Network Rail so desires, and such protective works must be carried out at the expense of the undertaker in either case without unnecessary delay and the undertaker must not commence the construction of the specified works until the engineer has notified the undertaker that the protective works have been completed to their reasonable satisfaction.
71.—(1) Any specified work and any protective works to be constructed by virtue of paragraph 70(3) must, when commenced, be constructed—
(a)
without unnecessary delay in accordance with the plans approved or deemed to have been approved or settled under paragraph 70(1);
(b)
under the supervision (where appropriate and if given) and to the reasonable satisfaction of the engineer;
(c)
in such manner as to cause as little damage as is possible to railway property; and
(d)
so far as is reasonably practicable, so as not to interfere with or obstruct the free, uninterrupted and safe use of any railway of Network Rail or the traffic thereon and the use by passengers of railway property.
(2) If any damage to railway property or any such interference or obstruction shall be caused by the carrying out of, or in consequence of the construction of a specified work, the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval, make good such damage and must pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may sustain by reason of any such damage, interference or obstruction.
(3) Nothing in this Part of this Schedule imposes any liability on the undertaker with respect to any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of Network Rail or its servants, contractors or agents or any liability on Network Rail with respect of any damage, costs, expenses or loss attributable to the negligence of the undertaker or its servants, contractors or agents.
72.  The undertaker must—
(a)
at all times afford reasonable facilities to the engineer for access to a specified work during its construction; and
(b)
supply the engineer with all such information as they may reasonably require with regard to a specified work or the method of constructing it.
73.  Network Rail must at all times afford reasonable facilities to the undertaker and its agents for access to any works carried out by Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule during their construction and must supply the undertaker with such information as it may reasonably require with regard to such works or the method of constructing them.
74.—(1) If any permanent or temporary alterations or additions to railway property are reasonably necessary in consequence of the construction or completion of a specified work, or during a period of 24 months after the completion of that work, in order to ensure the safety of railway property or the continued safe operation of the railway of Network Rail, such alterations and additions may be carried out by Network Rail and if Network Rail gives to the undertaker 56 days’ notice (or in the event of an emergency or safety critical issue such notice as is reasonable in the circumstances) of its intention to carry out such alterations or additions (which must be specified in the notice), the undertaker must pay to Network Rail the reasonable cost of those alterations or additions including, in respect of any such alterations and additions as are to be permanent, a capitalised sum representing the increase of the costs which may be expected to be reasonably incurred by Network Rail in maintaining, working and, when necessary, renewing any such alterations or additions.
(2) If during the construction of a specified work or a protective work by the undertaker, Network Rail gives notice to the undertaker that Network Rail desires itself to construct that part of the specified work or a protective work which in the opinion of the engineer is endangering the stability of railway property or the safe operation of traffic on the railways of Network Rail then, if the undertaker decides that part of the specified work or a protective work is to be constructed, Network Rail must assume construction of that part of the specified work or a protective work and the undertaker must, notwithstanding any such approval of a specified work under paragraph 70(3), pay to Network Rail all reasonable expenses to which Network Rail may be put and compensation for any loss which it may suffer by reason of the execution by Network Rail of that specified work or a protective work.
(3) The engineer must, in respect of the capitalised sums referred to in this paragraph and paragraph 75(a) provide such details of the formula by which those sums have been calculated as the undertaker may reasonably require.
(4) If the cost of maintaining, working or renewing railway property is reduced in consequence of any such alterations or additions a capitalised sum representing such saving must be set off against any sum payable by the undertaker to Network Rail under this paragraph.
75.  The undertaker must repay to Network Rail all reasonable fees, costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred by Network Rail—
(a)
in constructing any part of a specified work on behalf of the undertaker under the provisions of paragraph 70(3) or in constructing any protective works under the provisions of paragraph 70(4) including, in respect of any permanent protective works, a capitalised sum representing the cost of maintaining and renewing those works;
(b)
in respect of the approval by the engineer of plans submitted by the undertaker and the supervision by the engineer of the construction of a specified work or a protective work;
(c)
in respect of the employment or procurement of the services of any inspectors, signallers, watch-persons and other persons whom it shall be reasonably necessary to appoint for inspecting, signalling, watching and lighting railway property and for preventing, so far as may be reasonably practicable, interference, obstruction, danger or accident arising from the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work;
(d)
in respect of any special traffic working resulting from any speed restrictions which may in the opinion of the engineer, require to be imposed by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work or from the substitution or diversion of services which may be reasonably necessary for the same reason; and
(e)
in respect of any additional temporary lighting of railway property in the vicinity of the specified works, being lighting made reasonably necessary by reason or in consequence of the construction or failure of a specified work or a protective work.
76.—(1) In this paragraph—
“EMI” means, subject to sub-paragraph (2), electromagnetic interference with Network Rail apparatus generated by the operation of the authorised development where such interference is of a level which adversely affects the safe operation of Network Rail’s apparatus; and
“Network Rail’s apparatus” means any lines, circuits, wires, apparatus or equipment (whether or not modified or installed as part of the authorised development) which are owned or used by Network Rail for the purpose of transmitting or receiving electrical energy or of radio, telegraphic, telephonic, electric, electronic or other like means of signalling or other communications.
(2) This paragraph applies to EMI only to the extent that such EMI is not attributable to any change to Network Rail’s apparatus carried out after approval of plans under paragraph 70(1) for the relevant part of the authorised development giving rise to EMI (unless the undertaker has been given notice in writing before the approval of those plans of the intention to make such change).
(3) Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the undertaker must in the design and construction of the authorised development take all measures necessary to prevent EMI and must establish with Network Rail (both parties acting reasonably) appropriate arrangements to verify their effectiveness.
(4) In order to facilitate the undertaker’s compliance with sub-paragraph (3)—
(a)
the undertaker must consult with Network Rail as early as reasonably practicable to identify all Network Rail’s apparatus which may be at risk of EMI, and thereafter must continue to consult with Network Rail (both before and after formal submission of plans under paragraph 70(1)) in order to identify all potential causes of EMI and the measures required to eliminate them;
(b)
Network Rail must make available to the undertaker all information in the possession of Network Rail reasonably requested by the undertaker in respect of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a); and
(c)
Network Rail must allow the undertaker reasonable facilities for the inspection of Network Rail’s apparatus identified pursuant to sub-paragraph (a).
(5) In any case where it is established that EMI can only reasonably be prevented by modifications to Network Rail’s apparatus, Network Rail must not withhold its consent unreasonably to modifications of Network Rail’s apparatus, but the means of prevention and the method of their execution must be selected in the reasonable discretion of Network Rail, and in relation to such modifications paragraph 70(1) has effect subject to this sub-paragraph.
(6) Prior to the commencement of operation of the authorised development the undertaker shall test the use of the authorised development in a manner that shall first have been agreed with Network Rail and if, notwithstanding any measures adopted pursuant to sub-paragraph (3), the testing of the authorised development causes EMI then the undertaker must immediately upon receipt of notification by Network Rail of such EMI either in writing or communicated orally (such oral communication to be confirmed in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after it has been issued) forthwith cease to use (or procure the cessation of use of) the undertaker’s apparatus causing such EMI until all measures necessary have been taken to remedy such EMI by way of modification to the source of such EMI or (in the circumstances, and subject to the consent, specified in sub-paragraph (5)) to Network Rail’s apparatus.
(7) In the event of EMI having occurred—
(a)

in respect of costs incurred by Network Rail in complying with any railway operational procedures or obtaining any regulatory consents which procedures are required to be followed or consents obtained to facilitate the carrying out or operation of the authorised development,
and the undertaker must indemnify and keep indemnified Network Rail from and against all claims and demands arising out of or in connection with a specified work or a protective work or any such failure, act or omission: and the fact that any act or thing may have been done by Network Rail on behalf of the undertaker or in accordance with plans approved by the engineer or in accordance with any requirement of the engineer or under the engineer’s supervision shall not (if it was done without negligence on the part of Network Rail or of any person in its employ or of its contractors or agents) excuse the undertaker from any liability under the provisions of this sub-paragraph.
(2) Network Rail must give the undertaker reasonable notice of any such claim or demand and no settlement or compromise of such a claim or demand is to be made without the prior written consent of the undertaker.
(3) In no circumstances is the undertaker liable to Network Rail under sub-paragraph (1) for any indirect or consequential loss that was not in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time of making the Order.
(4) The sums payable by the undertaker under sub-paragraph (1) may include a sum equivalent to the relevant costs.

(6) The obligation under sub-paragraph (4) to pay Network Rail the relevant costs shall, in the event of default, be enforceable directly by any train operator concerned to the extent that such sums would be payable to that operator pursuant to sub paragraph (5).
(7) In this paragraph—
“the relevant costs” means the costs, direct losses and expenses (including loss of revenue) reasonably incurred by each train operator as a consequence of any specified work including but not limited to any restriction of the use of Network Rail’s railway network as a result of the construction, maintenance or failure of a specified work or any such act or omission as mentioned in subparagraph (1); and
“train operator” means any person who is authorised to act as the operator of a train by a licence under section 8 of the Railways Act 1993.

82.  In the assessment of any sums payable to Network Rail under this Part of this Schedule there must not be taken into account any increase in the sums claimed that is attributable to any action taken by or any agreement entered into by Network Rail if that action or agreement was not reasonably necessary and was taken or entered into with a view to obtaining the payment of those sums by the undertaker under this Part of this Schedule or increasing the sums so payable.
83.  The undertaker and Network Rail may, subject in the case of Network Rail to compliance with the terms of its network licence, enter into, and carry into effect, agreements for the transfer to the undertaker of—

87.  In relation to any dispute arising under this part of this Schedule (except for those disputes referred to in paragraph 76(11)) the provisions of article 61 (arbitration) shall not apply and any such dispute, unless otherwise provided for, must be referred to and settled by a single arbitrator to be agreed between the parties or, failing agreement, to be appointed on the application of either party (after giving notice in writing to the other) to the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers.

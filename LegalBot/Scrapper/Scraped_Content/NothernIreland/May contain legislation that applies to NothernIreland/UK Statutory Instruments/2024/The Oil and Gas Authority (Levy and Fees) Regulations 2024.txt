27th February 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision in respect of a levy and fees payable to the Oil and Gas Authority (“the OGA”).
Regulations 2 to 9 make provision for calculating and imposing a levy on the holders of petroleum licences in respect of the period beginning on 1st April 2024 and ending on 31st March 2025 (“the relevant charging period”). The levy is payable to meet costs incurred by the OGA in carrying out its functions as well as costs incurred by the Lord Chancellor in connection with the provision of Tribunals to consider appeals against the decisions of the OGA.
Regulation 3 sets out liability to pay the production levy for the relevant charging period. This is the highest rate of levy.
Regulation 4 sets out liability to pay the non-production levy. Paragraphs (2) and (3) provide that micro-enterprises holding promote or innovate licences at the relevant time in certain circumstances qualify to pay the non-production levy at discounted rates in respect of those licences.
Regulation 5 provides the methodology for calculating the production levy and the non-production levy.
Regulations 6 to 8 provide for the process by which licensees are notified as to the amount of levy payable, for interest to be payable on late payments, and for the OGA to be able to take action to recover any unpaid levy as a civil debt.
Regulation 9 requires the amount of the levy to be paid by licensees under regulations 3 and 4 to be adjusted if the total amount of levy to be recovered under these Regulations exceeds the leviable costs incurred by the OGA and the Lord Chancellor in respect of the relevant charging period. The OGA will credit the licensees appropriately should that be the case.
Regulation 10 amends the Oil and Gas Authority (Fees) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/904) to change certain fees charged by the OGA relating to the offshore oil and gas industry including in relation to carbon dioxide storage. The changes (some fees are increased and some decreased) do not reflect changes in inflation and are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum published alongside this instrument on www.legislation.gov.uk.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen. An impact assessment was produced for the original levy regulations, namely the Oil and Gas Authority (Levy) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 2015/1661), and is available from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero at 55 Whitehall, London SW1A 2HP and on www.legislation.gov.uk.

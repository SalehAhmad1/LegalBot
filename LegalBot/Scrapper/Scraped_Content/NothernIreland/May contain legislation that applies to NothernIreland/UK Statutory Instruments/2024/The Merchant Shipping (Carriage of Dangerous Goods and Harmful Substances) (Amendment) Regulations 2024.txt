These Regulations amend and substantially replace the Merchant Shipping (Dangerous Goods and Marine Pollutants) Regulations 1997 (S.I. 1997/2367), as well as revoking and replacing the Merchant Shipping (Gas Carriers) Regulations 1994 (S.I. 1994/2464) and the Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Packaged Irradiated Nuclear Fuel etc.) (INF Code) Regulations 2000 (S.I. 2000/3216).
These Regulations apply, with certain limited exceptions, to United Kingdom ships wherever they are (including those engaged on domestic voyages) and to non-United Kingdom ships when in United Kingdom waters or controlled waters (regulation 4).
These Regulations specifically make provision to give effect to the incident reporting requirements in Chapter VII of SOLAS and Protocol I to MARPOL, and for this purpose revoke and replace existing corresponding provisions in the Merchant Shipping (Reporting Requirements for Ships Carrying Dangerous or Polluting Goods) Regulations 1995 (S.I. 1995/2498) and the Merchant Shipping (Vessel Traffic Monitoring and Reporting Requirements) Regulations 2004 (S.I. 2004/2110).
These Regulations implement all amendments to Chapter VII and Annex III as at the date on which this instrument comes into force. Chapter VII also gives effect to the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (“the IMDG Code”), the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes Code (“the IMSBC Code”), the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk (“the IBC Code”), the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (“the IGC Code”) and the International Code for the Safe Carriage of Packaged Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes on board Ships (“the INF Code”). These Regulations also therefore give effect to the mandatory requirements in those Codes.
All future amendments to the provisions of Chapter VII, Annex III, Protocol I, the IMDG Code, the IMSBC Code, the IBC Code, the IGC Code and the INF Code will be automatically incorporated into United Kingdom law by way of the ambulatory reference provision (regulation 5) made under the power in section 306A of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995.
These Regulations provide for the granting of exemptions (regulation 6), the approval of equivalents (regulation 7) and the granting of approvals (regulation 8).
Part 2 (regulations 9 to 12) makes provision for the requirements applying in relation to ships carrying dangerous goods and harmful substances in packaged form. Regulation 12 makes specific provision in respect of the duties on shippers and forwarders.
Part 3 (regulations 13 to 16) makes provision for the requirements applying in relation to ships carrying dangerous goods in solid form in bulk. Regulation 16 makes specific provision in respect of the duties on shippers.
Part 4 (regulations 17 to 20) makes provision in respect of the requirements for the construction and equipment of ships carrying dangerous liquid chemicals in bulk.
Part 5 (regulations 21 to 24) makes provision in respect of the requirements for the construction and equipment of ships carrying liquefied gases in bulk.
Part 6 (regulations 25 to 27) makes provision in respect of the requirements for the carriage of packaged irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes on board ships.
Part 7 (regulations 28 to 30) makes provision in respect of the incident reporting requirements in Chapter VII of SOLAS and Protocol I to MARPOL.
Part 8 (regulations 31 to 33) makes provision for control and enforcement. Regulation 31 makes it an offence by the owner and master for a ship to be used in contravention of any of the requirements of these regulations (including the specific requirements in regulations 11 and 15). Regulation 32 makes it an offence by shippers and forwarders to contravene the requirements specified in regulations 12 and 16 respectively. Regulation 33 contains power to detain a ship in cases of non-compliance with these Regulations.
Regulation 34 requires the Secretary of State to review the operation and effect of these Regulations and publish a report before the end of the period of five years beginning with the date on which these Regulations come into force and at intervals not exceeding five years after that. Following a review, it will fall to the Secretary of State to consider whether the Regulations should remain as they are, or be amended or revoked. A further instrument would be needed to amend or revoke the Regulations.

28th May 2024EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order, which comes into force on 8th July 2024, amends the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax to Museums and Galleries) Order 2001 (S.I. 2001/2879) (“the 2001 Order”). The 2001 Order specifies the bodies that are entitled under section 33A of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (c.23) (“the Act”) to claim a refund of the VAT incurred by them that is attributable to the provision of free admission to specified museums and galleries which they operate.
The Schedule to the 2001 Order (“the Schedule”), in which the specified bodies and their related museums and galleries are listed, is amended by articles 3 to 6 of this Order. Article 3 omits eight bodies and their corresponding museums or galleries from the Schedule. Three additional museums or galleries are omitted by article 4 although their related bodies remain in the Schedule. Article 5 makes miscellaneous amendments to the details included in the Schedule. Nineteen new bodies, with their corresponding museums or galleries, are inserted at the end of the Schedule by Article 6.
Article 6 also includes (in the entries to be inserted in column 3 of the Schedule) the dates from which section 33A of the Act is to have effect in the case of each of the museums or galleries added. The relevant dates for twenty of the new entries are prior to the date on which this Order comes into force. This means that claims for refunds relating to these entries may be made in respect of VAT incurred before the commencement date for this Order in accordance with provision made in section 33A(1)(c) and (9)(d) of the Act.

particulars of the alibi, or
(ii)
the details of the alibi witness, or witnesses, required by the Act; or

(a)
notice of the confiscation proceedings;
(b)
notice that the prosecutor has named that person as an interested person, with the reasons why; and

notice of what that person must do under paragraph (9) of this rule, giving addresses for the court office, the prosecutor and the defendant.

(i)
the defendant or the prosecutor identifies an interested person,
(ii)
other information may affect the date fixed for the confiscation hearing, or
(iii)

(11) The court must not determine the extent of the defendant’s interest in property in which it appears to the court that another person holds an interest unless that interested person has had a reasonable opportunity to make representations.
(12) With or without a hearing, the court may—
(a)
shorten or extend a time limit which it has set;
(b)
vary, discharge or supplement an order (other than a confiscation order) which it has made where this rule applies; and
(c)
postpone the confiscation hearing.
[Note. Under section 6 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002(4), where a defendant is convicted of an offence the Crown Court must (with some exceptions)—
(a)
decide whether the defendant has ‘a criminal lifestyle’, within the meaning of the Act, or has benefited from particular criminal conduct;
(b)
decide the ‘recoverable amount’, within the meaning of the Act; and
(c)
make a confiscation order requiring the defendant to pay that amount.
Under section 14 of the 2002 Act(5), unless exceptional circumstances apply the court may postpone confiscation proceedings for a maximum of 2 years from the date of conviction, or until the end of a period of 3 months following the determination of an appeal by the defendant against conviction, if that is later.
Under section 16 of the 2002 Act, where the Crown Court is considering confiscation the prosecutor must give the court a statement of information which the prosecutor believes to be relevant to what the court must decide, within such period as the court directs. Under section 17 of the Act, where the prosecutor gives such a statement the court may order the defendant to respond and, if the defendant does not do so, then the court may treat the defendant as accepting the prosecutor’s allegations. Under section 18, for the purpose of obtaining information to help it in carrying out its functions the court may at any time order the defendant to give it information specified in the order and, if the defendant does not do so, then the court may draw such inference as it believes appropriate. Under section 18A(6), for the purpose of obtaining information to help it to determine the extent of the defendant’s interest in property the court may at any time order a person who the court thinks may hold an interest in that property to give it information specified in the order and, if that person does not do so, then the court may draw such inference as it believes appropriate.
Under section 27 of the 2002 Act(7), special provisions apply where the defendant absconds.

(ii)

“(d)
state the name and address of the relevant financial institution at which the account in which the money ordered to be paid is held and the sort code, if known;”, and

“[Note. Under section 67(8) of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002(9), “relevant financial institution” means a bank, a building society, an electronic money institution or a payment institution; “electronic money institution” means an institution or person registered by the Financial Conduct Authority under the Electronic Money Regulations 2011; and “payment institution” means a person registered by that Authority under the Payment Services Regulations 2017.]”;

“Application to realise seized property or to realise or destroy cryptoassets
33.25.—(1) This rule applies where a magistrates’ court can make an order—
(a)
under section 67A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002(10) authorising the realisation of seized personal property;
(b)
under section 67B of the 2002 Act(11) determining any storage, insurance or realisation costs recoverable by the officer;
(c)
under section 67ZA of the 2002 Act(12) requiring the realisation of seized cryptoassets; or
(d)
under section 67AA of the 2002 Act(13) authorising the destruction of seized cryptoassets.
(2) An applicant for such an order must—
(a)
apply in writing; and
(b)
serve the application on—
(i)
the court officer, and
(ii)
any person whom the applicant believes would be affected by an order, including (where the application concerns cryptoassets) the UK-connected cryptoasset service provider which administers the crypto wallet in which the cryptoassets are held.
(3) The application must—
(a)
specify the property or cryptoassets concerned;
(b)
explain the applicant’s entitlement to apply and, as applicable—
(i)
how the proposed realisation of personal property meets the conditions prescribed by section 67A of the 2002 Act,
(ii)
how any storage, etc. costs have been calculated,
(iii)
how the proposed realisation of cryptoassets meets the conditions prescribed by section 67ZA of the 2002 Act, and
(iv)
how the proposed destruction of cryptoassets meets the conditions prescribed by section 67AA of the 2002 Act;
(c)
attach any material on which the applicant relies; and
(d)
propose the terms of the order, including an assessment of the market value of any cryptoassets ordered to be destroyed.
(4) The court may—
(a)
determine the application at a hearing, or without a hearing;
(b)
consider an application made orally instead of in writing; and
(c)
consider an application which has not been served on a person likely to be affected by an order.
(5) If the court authorises a realisation of personal property or a realisation or destruction of cryptoassets, the applicant must—
(a)
notify any person affected by the order who was absent when it was made; and
(b)
serve on the court officer a list of those so notified.
[Note. Under sections 67ZA and 67A of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, one of the officers listed in section 41A of the Act(14) may apply to a magistrates’ court for authority to realise personal property or cryptoassets seized by such an officer if—
(a)
a confiscation order has been made against a person who holds that property or those cryptoassets;
(b)
no receiver has been appointed in relation to that property or those cryptoassets; and
(c)
any period allowed for payment of the confiscation order has expired.
Under section 67AA of the 2002 Act, in those same circumstances an officer may apply to a magistrates’ court for authority to destroy cryptoassets if it is not reasonably practicable to realise them or there are reasonable grounds to believe that their realisation would be contrary to the public interest, having regard in particular to how likely it is that the entry of the cryptoassets into general circulation would facilitate criminal conduct by any person.
Under section 67B of the 2002 Act(15), if a magistrates’ court makes an order under section 67A then on the same or a subsequent occasion the court may determine an amount which may be recovered by the applicant in respect of reasonable costs incurred in storing or insuring the property, or realising it.
In the 2002 Act, for the purposes of the provisions to which this rule refers—
(a)
section 84(16) makes general provisions about property; and
(b)
section 84A(17) defines ‘cryptoasset’ and related expressions.]”;

(l)

(i)
in paragraph (1)(a) for “an officer to realise property” substitute “the realisation of personal property or requiring the realisation of cryptoassets”,
(ii)
in paragraph (1)(b) omit “so authorised”,
(iii)
in paragraph (1)(d) after “the property” insert “or cryptoassets”, and
(iv)
in paragraph (3)(a) for “which was” substitute “or cryptoassets”;
(m)
in rule 33.28 (Application for approval to seize property or to search)—
(i)
in paragraph (1) omit “who is entitled to apply”,
(ii)
for paragraph (1)(a) substitute—
“(a)
under section 47C of that Act(19), to seize—
(i)
realisable property which is not cash or exempt property, or
(ii)
any free property which is a cryptoasset-related item; or”, and
(iii)
for the first paragraph of the note to the rule substitute—
“[Note. Under section 47C of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, if any of the conditions listed in section 47B of the Act(20) are met then one of the officers listed in section 47A(21) may seize—
(a)
realisable property other than cash or exempt property as defined in section 47C, if the officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that—
(i)
the property may otherwise be made unavailable for satisfying any confiscation order that has been or may be made against a defendant; or
(ii)
the value of the property may otherwise be diminished as a result of conduct by the defendant or any other person; and
(b)
any free property if the officer has reasonable grounds for suspecting that it is a cryptoasset-related item as defined in section 47C.
In the 2002 Act, for the purposes of the provisions to which this rule refers—
(a)
section 82(22) defines ‘free property’;
(b)
section 83 defines ‘realisable property’;
(c)
section 84 makes general provisions about property; and
(d)
section 84A defines ‘cryptoasset’ and related expressions.”;
(n)
in rule 33.53 (Application for discharge or variation of restraint or ancillary order by a person affected by the order) after paragraph (4) insert—
“(5) Where the application is for the Crown Court to make or vary an exception for the applicant’s reasonable living expenses it must include—
(a)
details of the applicant’s current income and expenditure, with evidence of each item; and
(b)
representations about proposed expenditure that include—
(i)
the applicant’s previous standard of living and usual expenditure;
(ii)
the possibility that the expenditure might maintain or improve the value of assets available to meet a confiscation order,
(iii)
the possibility that the expenditure might reduce the value of such assets to less than the likely value of a confiscation order,

in respect of each set of premises, whether specified or not, explain the grounds for believing (where the application is under Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act) or suspecting (where the application is under Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act) that material sought is on those premises;
(e)
in relation to any set of premises which the applicant wants to be searched on more than one occasion—
(i)
explain why it is necessary to search on more than one occasion in order to achieve the purpose for which the applicant wants the court to issue the warrant, and
(ii)
specify any proposed maximum number of occasions; and
(f)
in relation to any set of premises which the applicant wants to be searched by the officers executing the warrant with other persons authorised by the court—
(i)
identify those other persons, by function or description, and
(ii)
explain why those persons are required.
(3) Where the grounds of an application for a search warrant are those listed in paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act (terrorist investigation; application to a justice of the peace), the application must explain—
(a)
the grounds for believing that—
(i)
the material sought does not consist of or include excluded material, special procedure material or items subject to legal privilege,
(ii)
the material is likely to be of substantial value to a terrorist investigation (whether by itself, or together with other material), and
(iii)
the material must be seized in order to prevent it from being concealed, lost, damaged, altered or destroyed; and
(b)
why the issue of a warrant is likely to be necessary in the circumstances of the case, unless the application—
(i)
is made by a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent, and
(ii)
does not relate to residential premises.
(4) Where the grounds of an application for a search warrant are those listed in paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act (relevant act investigation; application to a justice of the peace), the application must explain the grounds for suspecting that the material sought—
(a)
is likely to be evidence that a relevant act has been, or is about to be, committed; and

does not consist of or include confidential material.
(5) Where the grounds of an application for a search warrant are those listed in paragraphs 11 and 12(1) of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act(29) or paragraph 9(2) of the 2023 Act (non-compliance with a production, etc. order; application to a judge) the application must—

identify the order and describe its terms; and
(b)
specify the date on which it was served.
(6) Where the grounds of an application for a search warrant are those listed in paragraphs 11 and 12(2) to (4) of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act (terrorist investigation; application to a judge), the application must explain the grounds for believing that—
(a)
the material sought consists of or includes excluded material or special procedure material but does not include items subject to legal privilege;
(b)
the material is likely to be of substantial value to a terrorist investigation (whether by itself, or together with other material); and
(c)
it is not appropriate to make an order under paragraph 5 of Schedule 11 to the 2000 Act in relation to the material because—
(i)
it is not practicable to communicate with any person entitled to produce the material,
(ii)
it is not practicable to communicate with any person entitled to grant access to the material or entitled to grant entry to premises to which the application for the warrant relates, or
(iii)
a terrorist investigation may be seriously prejudiced unless a constable can secure immediate access to the material.
(7) Where the grounds of an application for a search warrant are those listed in paragraph 9(3) of Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act (relevant act investigation; application to a judge), the application must—
(a)
explain the grounds for suspecting that the material sought—
(i)
is likely to be evidence that a relevant act has been, or is about to be, committed, and
(ii)
consists of or includes confidential material but does not include items subject to legal privilege;
(b)
explain the grounds for believing that the material is likely to be of substantial value, whether by itself or with other material, to an investigation into whether a relevant act has been, or is about to be, committed;
(c)
explain the grounds for believing that it is in the public interest for the material to be obtained having regard to—
(i)
the benefit likely to accrue to the investigation if it is obtained, and
(ii)
the circumstances in which the respondent has any of the material; and
(d)
explain how any one or more of the following applies—
(i)
it is not practicable to communicate with any person entitled to grant entry to those premises,
(ii)
it is not practicable to communicate with any person entitled to grant access to the material,
(iii)
the investigation may be seriously prejudiced unless a constable can secure immediate access to the material.
(8) Where the application is for a warrant for the retention of confidential journalistic material under paragraph 15A of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act or under paragraph 13 of Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act, as well as complying with rule 47.26 the application must—
(a)
be made as soon as reasonably practicable after the confidential journalistic material is seized;
(b)
describe the circumstances of the seizure;
(c)
specify the offence or relevant act under investigation and, as applicable, either—
(i)
explain how the investigation constitutes a terrorist investigation within the meaning of the 2000 Act, or
(ii)
explain the grounds for suspecting that a relevant act within the meaning of the 2023 Act has been, or is about to be, committed;
(d)
explain the grounds for believing that the confidential journalistic material seized is likely to be of substantial value, whether by itself or with other material, to the investigation;
(e)
explain the grounds for believing that it is in the public interest for that material to be retained having regard to the benefit likely to accrue to the investigation if it is retained;
(f)
explain to what conditions, if any, the applicant proposes that the retention of the material should be made subject, if the court issues a warrant; and

[Note. Under paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to the Terrorism Act 2000, where the conditions listed in that paragraph are fulfilled a constable may apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant authorising a search for material, other than excluded material or special procedure material, on specified premises or on any premises of a specified person. Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 to the National Security Act 2023, where the conditions listed in that paragraph are fulfilled a constable may apply to a justice of the peace for a warrant authorising a search for material, other than confidential material. Under paragraphs 11 and 12 of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act a constable may apply to a Circuit judge for such a warrant in respect of excluded or special procedure material. Under paragraph 9 of Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act, a constable may apply to a Crown Court judge for a warrant in respect of confidential material. No such warrant authorises the seizure of items subject to legal privilege.
Under paragraph 4 of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act, ‘legal privilege’, ‘excluded material’ and ‘special procedure material’ mean the same as under sections 10, 11 and 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984(30).
Under paragraph 15 of Schedule 5 to the 2000 Act, ‘confidential journalistic material’ means material which is excluded material by virtue of section 11(1)(c) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (journalistic material which a person holds in confidence and which consists of documents or records other than documents).
Under paragraph 17 of Schedule 2 to the 2023 Act, ‘confidential material’ means—
(a)
material created or acquired for the purposes of journalism which is held in confidence or which the sender of that material to someone else intends the intended recipient to hold in confidence (‘confidential journalistic material’);
(b)
items subject to legal privilege within the meaning of section 10 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; and
(c)
excluded material and special procedure material within the meaning of sections 11 and 14 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, other than journalistic material.
Under section 16(3) of the 1984 Act(31), entry and search under a warrant must be within 3 months from the date of its issue.
See also the code of practice for the search of premises issued under section 66 of the 1984 Act(32).]”; and

Rule Amendment
Part 2 Rule 2.2 is amended to include a reference to live links in extradition proceedings. Rule 2.8 is amended to allow a justices’ legal adviser to direct the correction of a court record (and see the amendment to rule 5.4).
Part 3 Rule 3.1 is amended to include a reference to extradition proceedings. Rules 3.3 and 3.8 are amended to provide for witness companions and advisors. Rule 3.19 is amended to list all the circumstances in which the prosecutor is required to serve evidence in the Crown Court. Rule 3.35 is amended (i) to apply the rule in extradition proceedings, and (ii) to require the applicant for a live link from abroad to obtain any permission needed from the authorities there.
Part 5 Rule 5.4 is amended to acknowledge the powers of courts and court officers to correct errors in court records.
Part 14 Rule 14.6 is amended to require an application to vary bail conditions to be made to the court that authorised the extension of pre-charge bail, where a defendant is on pre-charge bail that has been extended.
Part 15 Rules 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5 and 15.9 are amended, and the notes at the end of the rule are omitted, (i) to clarify the procedures required by the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, and (ii) to provide for the service of a prosecutor’s disclosure management document.
Part 18 Rule 18.1 is amended, and rules 18.14 to 18.17 are omitted, to remove redundant rules about defendant’s evidence directions. Rule 18.8 is amended to provide for the editing of a video recording of pre-trial cross-examination if that is ordered by the court.
Part 33 Rules 33.2 and 33.3 are omitted to allow time limits equivalent to existing time limits to be expressed in business days, as in other Criminal Procedure Rules.

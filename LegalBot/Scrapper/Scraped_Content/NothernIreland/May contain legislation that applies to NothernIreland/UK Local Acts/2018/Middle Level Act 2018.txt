(4)
A byelaw made by the Commissioners in exercise of the power conferred upon them by this section shall be made under the common seal of the Commissioners and may revoke or vary a byelaw made by them either pursuant to section 51 of the Middle Level Act 1874 or in the exercise of that power.
(5)
No byelaw made under the provisions of this section shall render unlawful the doing on private land outside a waterway or its banks of any act by, or with the lawful authority of, the owner or occupier of that land which does not obstruct the use of a waterway, or injure or endanger any person lawfully using a waterway or its banks or enjoying its amenities.
(6)
Byelaws made under this section may make it an offence for any person to contravene, or fail to comply with, the provisions of the byelaws, and for such person to be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.

In any proceedings for such an offence it shall be a defence for the person charged to prove—

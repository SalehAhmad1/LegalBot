“Modification of premises licences to authorise off-sales for limited period
172F
Authorisation of off-sales for limited period
(1)
Subsection (2) applies to a premises licence if—
(a)
the licence has effect, or is capable of having effect, on the day on which this section comes into force (“day X”),
(b)
immediately before day X, it is an on-sales only licence, and
(c)
no disqualifying event has occurred in relation to the licence in the period of three years ending with day X.
(2)
The premises licence is to be treated as if, at the beginning of day X, it is varied so that it authorises off-sales during the relevant period subject to the condition that every off-sale must be made at a pre-cut off time when the licensed premises are open for the purposes of selling alcohol for consumption on the premises.
(3)
Any provisions of the premises licence on day X are suspended in so far as they are inconsistent with the authorisation granted by virtue of subsection (2) (and for so long as that authorisation has effect).
(4)
Subsection (5) applies to a premises licence if—
(a)
the licence has effect, or is capable of having effect, on day X,
(b)
immediately before day X, it authorises the sale by retail of alcohol for consumption on the licensed premises and it also authorises off-sales, and
(c)
at that time that authorisation is subject to one or more of the following—
(i)
one or more conditions relating to the time when an off-sale may be made that would prevent an off-sale during the relevant period being made at a pre-cut off time when the licensed premises are open for the purposes of selling alcohol for consumption on the premises;
(ii)
one or more conditions applicable to pre-cut off times that would prevent an off-sale during the relevant period where the alcohol is sold in an open container;
(iii)
one or more conditions applicable to pre-cut off times that would prevent an off-sale during the relevant period where it is a sale for delivery.
(5)
The premises licence is to be treated as if, at the beginning of day X, it is varied so that, in so far as and for so long as it authorises off-sales during the relevant period, it includes—
(a)
where the requirement in subsection (4)(c)(i) is met, a condition that off-sales that would otherwise have been prevented by the condition or conditions mentioned in subsection (4)(c)(i) from being made at a pre-cut off time when the licensed premises are open for the purposes of selling alcohol for consumption on the premises may be made at such a time;
(b)
where the requirement in subsection (4)(c)(ii) is met, a condition that off-sales at a pre-cut off time that would otherwise have been prevented by the condition or conditions mentioned in subsection (4)(c)(ii) from being in the form of alcohol sold in an open container may be in that form;
(c)
where the requirement in subsection (4)(c)(iii) is met, a condition that off-sales at a pre-cut off time that would otherwise have been prevented by the condition or conditions mentioned in subsection (4)(c)(iii) from being a sale for delivery may be such a sale.
(6)
For so long as a condition has effect by virtue of subsection (5)(a), (b) or (c), the conditions of the licence referred to in subsection (4)(c)(i), (ii) or (iii) (as the case may be) are suspended in so far as they prevent the matters mentioned in that provision.
(7)

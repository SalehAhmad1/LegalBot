(1)
This paragraph applies where—
(a)
at any time during an emergency period, a local authority begins to meet needs under section 18, 19, 20 or 62 of CA 2014,
(b)
at that time, the authority would have been entitled to make a charge under section 14 of that Act for meeting any of those needs, but
(c)
the authority decided not to carry out an assessment under section 17 of that Act before beginning to meet those needs.
In this paragraph “emergency period”, in relation to section 18, 19, 20 or 62 of CA 2014, means a period for which paragraph 4, 5, 6 or (as the case may be) 9 of this Schedule has effect.
(2)
The local authority is not prevented by that decision from subsequently carrying out an assessment under section 17 of CA 2014 (whether during or after the emergency period) and deciding to make a charge for meeting those needs during that period; and nothing in that section is to be taken to prevent the authority from carrying out such an assessment, even though the authority has already begun to meet, or has met, those needs.
(3)
In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 18 or 19(2) of CA 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 1, 2 or 3 in section 18 of that Act is not met at the time of the making of the charge does not affect anything already done under section 18 or (as the case may be) 19(2) of that Act.
(4)
In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 20(1) of CA 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 1, 2, 3 or 4 in that section is not met at the time of the making of the charge does not affect anything already done under that section.

This paragraph applies where—
(a)
at any time during an emergency period, a local authority begins to meet needs under section 35 or 40 of SSW(W)A 2014,
(b)
at that time, the authority would have been entitled to impose a charge under section 59 of that Act for meeting any of those needs, but
(c)
the authority decided not to carry out an assessment under section 63(2) of that Act before beginning to meet those needs.
In this paragraph “emergency period” means a period for which paragraph 26 or (as the case may be) 27 has effect.
(2)
The local authority is not prevented by that decision from subsequently carrying out an assessment under section 63(2) of SSW(W)A 2014 (whether during or after the emergency period) and deciding to impose a charge for meeting those needs during that period; and nothing in that section is to be taken to prevent the authority from carrying out such an assessment, even though the authority has already begun to meet, or has met, those needs.
(3)
In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 35 of SSW(W)A 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 3 in that section is not met at the time of the imposition of the charge does not affect anything already done under that section.
(4)
In so far as there is any charge for meeting any needs under section 40 of SSW(W)A 2014 during the emergency period, the fact that condition 3 in that section is not met at the time of the imposition of the charge does not affect anything already done under that section.]

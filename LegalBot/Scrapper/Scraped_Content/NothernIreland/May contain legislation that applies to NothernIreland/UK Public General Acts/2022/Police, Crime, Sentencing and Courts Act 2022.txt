unless the Secretary of State forms the view that the application is frivolous or vexatious, refer it to the High Court.

make a reduction order in relation to relevant young offender, or
(b)
confirm the minimum term in respect of the offender’s DHMP sentence,
and a decision of the court under this subsection is final.
(3)
A reduction order is an order that the relevant young offender’s minimum term is to be reduced to such part of the offender’s DHMP sentence as the court considers appropriate and is specified in the reduction order.
(4)
In deciding whether to make a reduction order, the court must, in particular, take into account any evidence—
(a)
that the relevant young offender’s rehabilitation has been exceptional;
(b)
that the continued detention or imprisonment of the offender for the remainder of the minimum term is likely to give rise to a serious risk to the welfare or continued rehabilitation of the offender which cannot be eliminated or mitigated to a significant degree.

(4)
In this section—
“minimum term”, in relation to a relevant young offender, means the part of the offender’s DHMP sentence specified in the minimum term order made in respect of the sentence (and for these purposes “DHMP sentence” and “minimum term order” have same meanings as in that section 27A);

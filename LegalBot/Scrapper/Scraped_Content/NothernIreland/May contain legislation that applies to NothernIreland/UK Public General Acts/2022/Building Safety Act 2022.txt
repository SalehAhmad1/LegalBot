The regulatory authority may give a serious contravention notice to a local authority or a registered building control approver if it appears to the regulatory authority (following an investigation under section 58Z3 or otherwise) that the condition in subsection (2) or (3) is met.
(2)
The condition in this subsection is that—
(a)
the local authority or registered building control approver has contravened operational standards rules, and
(b)
as a result of the contravention the safety of persons in or about buildings has been, or may have been, put at risk.
(3)
This condition in this subsection is that the local authority or registered building control approver—
(a)
has been given an improvement notice under section 58Z4, and
(b)
has failed to remedy the contravention of operational standards rules in respect of which the notice was given.
(4)
A serious contravention notice is a notice requiring the local authority or registered building control approver to remedy the contravention in question by doing, or by refraining from doing, anything specified in the order.
(5)
A serious contravention notice may have effect—
(a)
until it is revoked, or

Cancellation of initial notice when work becomes higher-risk building work
(1)
If, at a time when an initial notice is in force, it appears to the registered building control approver that some or all of the work has become higher-risk building work, the registered building control approver must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, cancel the relevant part of the initial notice by notice in the prescribed form given to—
(a)
the local authority concerned, and
(b)
the person carrying out or intending to carry out the work.
(2)
If, at a time when an initial notice is in force, it appears to the person carrying out or intending to carry out the work that some or all of the work has become higher-risk building work, the person must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, cancel the relevant part of the initial notice by notice in the prescribed form given to—
(a)
the local authority concerned, and
(b)
the registered building control approver.
(3)
Where a person is required to give a notice under subsection (1) or (2) in relation to higher-risk building work in England, the person must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, give a copy of that notice to the regulator.
(4)
If, at a time when an initial notice is in force, it appears to the local authority concerned that some or all of the work has become higher-risk building work, the authority must cancel the relevant part of the initial notice by notice in the prescribed form given to—

(b)
the person shown in the initial notice as the person intending to carry out the work.
(5)
Where a local authority is required to give a notice under subsection (4) in relation to higher-risk building work in England, the local authority must give a copy of that notice to the regulator.

(a)
was given in respect of part of the work to which the relevant part of the initial notice relates, and

(a)
in England, the regulator, and
(b)
in Wales, the relevant local authority (within the meaning of section 121A(2)).

(6)
In any case where this section applies, the reference in subsection (4) of section 36 to the date of the completion of the work in question has effect, in relation to a notice under subsection (1) of that section, as if it were a reference to the date on which the relevant part of the initial notice ceased to be in force.
(7)
In this section “the relevant part of the initial notice” means so much of the initial notice as was cancelled by a notice under section 52A (cancellation of initial notice when work becomes higher-risk building work).”

the person shown in the initial notice as the person intending to carry out the work, or
(b)
the registered building control approver,
may appeal to the appropriate court or tribunal.
(2B)
On an appeal under subsection (2A), the court or tribunal must determine whether the relevant part of the initial notice was properly cancelled.
(2C)
In a case where the court or tribunal determines that the relevant part of the initial notice was not properly cancelled—
(a)
the determination does not have the effect of reinstating the relevant part of the initial notice;
(b)
section 52B(2) and (6) continue to apply in relation to the relevant part of the initial notice;
(c)
a new initial notice relating to any of the work to which the relevant part of the original initial notice related (the “original work”) may be given only if the new initial notice—
(i)
is given before the end of the period of seven days beginning with the day on which the appeal is determined or such other period as may be prescribed, and
(ii)
relates to all of the original work, except for any work in respect of which a final certificate has been accepted by the local authority;
(d)
the court or tribunal may give such directions as it considers appropriate in consequence of the determination (which may include giving directions to the regulator).
(2D)
Where—
(a)
a plans certificate has been given in respect of any of the original work,
(b)
the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 53(2) are fulfilled with respect to that certificate, and
(c)
a new initial notice as referred to in subsection (2C)(c) is accepted,
section 50(1C) does not apply in relation to so much of the work to which the new initial notice relates as is work specified in the plans certificate.
(2E)
Where—
(a)
a new initial notice is given in accordance with subsection (2C)(c), and
(b)
the registered building control approver shown in the new initial notice is different to the registered building control approver shown in the original initial notice,
sections 53B to 53E apply as if any reference in those sections to a new initial notice given in accordance with section 53(7)(a) were a reference to a new initial notice given in accordance with section 55(2C)(c).
(2F)
In this section the “relevant part of the initial notice” means so much of the initial notice as was subject to the cancellation notice.”

This subsection is subject to subsection (5) (special rule for commonhold land).
(2)
A person (“the estate owner”) who holds a legal estate in possession in the common parts of a higher-risk building or any part of them (“the relevant common parts”) is not an accountable person for the building by virtue of subsection (1)(a) if—
(a)
each long lease of which the estate owner is lessor provides that a particular person, who does not hold a legal estate in any part of the building, is under a relevant repairing obligation in relation to all of the relevant common parts, or
(b)
all repairing obligations relating to the relevant common parts which would otherwise be obligations of the estate owner are functions of an RTM company.

(a)
under a lease, a person (“the estate owner”) holds a legal estate in possession in the common parts of a higher-risk building or any part of them (“the relevant common parts”), and

(4)
For the purposes of this section and section 73—
(a)
the legal estate in possession in so much of the relevant common parts as are within subsection (3)(b) is treated as held by the landlord (instead of the estate owner), and
(b)
if (and so far as) the landlord’s actual legal estate in those common parts is held under a lease, the legal estate in possession mentioned in paragraph (a) is treated as held under that lease (and, accordingly, subsection (3) and this subsection may apply in relation to it).

(6)
For the purposes of this section—

the structure and exterior of the building, except so far as included in a demise of a single dwelling or of premises to be occupied for the purposes of a business, or
(b)
any part of the building provided for the use, benefit and enjoyment of the residents of more than one residential unit (whether alone or with other persons);

Meaning of “connected replacement lease”
(1)
For the purposes of section 119 (and this section) a lease (the “new lease”) is a “connected replacement lease” if—
(a)
the new lease is a lease of a single dwelling in a relevant building,
(b)
the tenant under the new lease is liable to pay a service charge,
(c)
the new lease was granted on or after 14 February 2022,
(d)
the new lease replaces—
(i)
one other lease, which is a qualifying lease (whether under section 119(2) or (3A)), or
(ii)
two or more other leases, at least one of which is a qualifying lease (whether under section 119(2) or (3A)), and
(e)
there is continuity in the property let.
(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1)(d), the new lease replaces another lease if—
(a)
the term of the new lease begins during the term of the other lease, and the new lease is granted in substitution of the other lease, or
(b)
the term of the new lease begins at the end of the term of the other lease (regardless of when the lease is granted).
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2)(a), the circumstances in which the new lease is granted in substitution of another lease include circumstances where—
(a)
the new lease is granted by way of a surrender and regrant of the other lease (including a deemed surrender and regrant, whether deemed under an enactment or otherwise);
(b)
the new lease is granted under—
(i)
section 24 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (renewed business leases),
(ii)

(a)
the newly let property is exactly the same as the already let property,
(b)

(c)
the newly let property consists of some, but not all, of the already let property (but no other property) (a “property reduction”).
(5)
But there is no continuity in the property let by virtue of a property reduction if, as respects any lease in the relevant chain of qualifying leases, there was continuity in the property let by virtue of a property combination.
(6)
For that purpose, the “relevant” chain of qualifying leases is the chain of qualifying leases of which the new lease would be part were it a connected replacement lease.
(7)
For the purposes of subsection (1)(e) there is also continuity in the property let if the new lease is granted to rectify any error in the lease, or any lease, which the new lease replaces.
(8)
Where a dwelling is at any time on or after 14 February 2022 let under two or more leases to which subsection (1)(a) and (b) apply, any of the leases which is superior to any of the other leases is not a connected replacement lease.
(9)
For the purposes of sections 122 to [F2124] and Schedule 8, all of the leases in a chain of qualifying leases are to be treated as a single qualifying lease which has a term that—
(a)
began when the term of the initial qualifying lease in that chain began, and
(b)
ends when the term of the current connected replacement lease in that chain ends.
(10)
The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision about the meaning of “connected replacement lease” (including provision changing the meaning).

the first replacement lease, and
(c)
any other connected replacement lease if the preceding qualifying lease in relation to it is—
(i)
the first replacement lease, or
(ii)
any other connected replacement lease which is in the chain of qualifying leases;
and a chain of qualifying leases may accordingly consist of different leases at different times (if further connected replacement leases are granted);

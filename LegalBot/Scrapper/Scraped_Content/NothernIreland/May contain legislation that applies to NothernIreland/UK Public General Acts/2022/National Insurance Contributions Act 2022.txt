National Insurance Contributions Act 2022
2022 CHAPTER 9
An Act to make provision in relation to national insurance contributions.
[15th March 2022]
Be it enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—1
Zero-rate contributions for employees at [F1special tax sites]: Great Britain
(1)
This section applies where—
(a)
a secondary Class 1 contribution is payable as mentioned in section 6(1)(b) of the 1992 Act in respect of earnings paid in a tax week in respect of an employed earner’s employment by an employer other than a public authority,
(b)
the [F2applicable conditions] are met in relation to the contribution (see section 2), and
(c)
the employer (or, if different, the secondary contributor) elects that this section is to apply in relation to the contribution for the purposes of section 9(1) of the 1992 Act instead of section 9(1A) of that Act or section 6 of this Act.
(2)
For the purposes of section 9(1) of the 1992 Act—
(a)
the relevant percentage in respect of any earnings paid in the tax week up to or at the upper secondary threshold is 0%, and
(b)
the relevant percentage in respect of any earnings paid in the tax week above that threshold is the secondary percentage.
(3)
The upper secondary threshold (or the prescribed equivalent in relation to earners paid otherwise than weekly) is the amount specified in, or in regulations under, section 8.
(4)
For the purposes of the 1992 Act a person is still to be regarded as being liable to pay a secondary Class 1 contribution even if the amount of the contribution is £0 as a result of this section.
(5)
The Treasury may by regulations make provision about cases in which this section is to be treated as applying in relation to contributions payable in respect of a tax week in a given tax year only when—
(a)
that tax year has ended, and
(b)
all contributions payable in respect of a tax week in that tax year have been paid.
(6)
Regulations under subsection (5) may modify the [F3applicable conditions] in section 2(1)(c) and (d) for the purposes of cases to which the regulations apply.

[F1Applicable conditions]
(1)
[F2The applicable conditions] are that—
(a)
the employed earner’s employment is a new employment that—
(i)
begins on or after 6 April 2022, but
(ii)
does not begin later than [F3the applicable sunset date],
(b)
the earnings—
(i)
are paid during the period of three years beginning with the first day of the employment, but
(ii)
are not paid after the relevant end date (see subsection (6)),
(c)
the contribution is paid in respect of earnings paid in a tax week all of which is in a qualifying period of the employment, and
(d)
at the time the qualifying period begins, the employer reasonably expects that 60% or more of the earner’s employed time during that period will be spent in a single [F4special tax site] in which the employer has business premises.
(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), an employment is new if the earner was not employed by the employer or by a person connected with the employer (within the meaning of section 993 of the Income Tax Act 2007) at any time within the period of two years ending with the day on which the employment begins.
[F5(2A)
For the purposes of this section “the applicable sunset date”, in relation to a special tax site, means —
(a)
5 April 2026, or
(b)
such later date as may be specified under section 332(4)(b) of the Finance (No.2) Act 2023 as the applicable sunset date in relation to the site concerned for the purposes of the provisions mentioned in subsection (4) of that section.]
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (1)(c) a qualifying period of the employment is a period—
(a)
that begins with—
(i)
the start of the employment, or
(ii)
a substantial change in the earner’s working arrangements, and
(b)
that ends (subject to subsection (4)(d)) with—
(i)
the end of the employment,
(ii)
the relevant end date, or
(iii)
a substantial change in the earner’s working arrangements.
(4)
For the purposes of subsection (1)(d)—
(a)
an earner’s employed time is time when the earner is expected to provide services to the employer under the terms of a contract of service (“working time”), together with time when the earner would have provided such services but for being on leave (of any sort);
(b)
it is to be assumed that the proportion of the time when an earner is on leave that is spent at any given [F6special tax site] is the same as the proportion of the earner’s working time that would be spent at that site if the earner were not on leave;
(c)
it does not matter whether the earner is expected to provide services under a single contract of service or under successive contracts of service, provided that the employment does not cease;
(d)
if an expectation for the purposes of subsection (1)(d) ceases to be reasonable in any given tax week, the condition in that subsection ceases to be met, and the qualifying period is taken to end, at the end of the previous tax week.
(5)
If the secondary contributor in relation to the earner is not the earner’s employer—
(a)
subsection (1)(d) has effect as if both references to “the employer” were references to “the secondary contributor”, and
(b)
subsection (2) has effect as if, after both references to “the employer”, there were inserted “or the secondary contributor”.
[F7(6)
The relevant end date is the last day of the period of three years beginning with the day after the applicable sunset date.]

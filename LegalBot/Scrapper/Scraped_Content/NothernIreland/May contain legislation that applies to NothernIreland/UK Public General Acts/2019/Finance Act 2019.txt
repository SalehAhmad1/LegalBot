the lost tax involves an offshore transfer which makes the lost tax significantly harder to identify.
(2)
An assessment on a person (“the taxpayer”) may be made at any time not more than 12 years after the end of the year of assessment to which the lost tax relates.
This is subject to section 36(1A) above and any other provision of the Taxes Acts allowing a longer period.

assets situated or held in a territory outside the United Kingdom,
(c)
income or assets received in a territory outside the United Kingdom,

in a case where the taxpayer (or a person acting on the taxpayer's behalf) delivered a return under the Taxes Acts to HMRC for the year of assessment to which the lost tax relates and in which information relating to the lost tax was required to be provided, the date on which the return was delivered, and
(b)
in any other case, 31 January in the year of assessment after that to which the lost tax relates;
references to income or proceeds transferred include references to assets derived from or representing the income or proceeds.

(a)
HMRC was significantly less likely to become aware of the lost tax, or
(b)
HMRC was likely to become aware of the lost tax only at a significantly later time.
(7)
But an assessment may not be made under subsection (2) if—
(a)
before the time limit that would otherwise apply for making the assessment, HMRC received relevant overseas information on the basis of which HMRC could reasonably have been expected to become aware of the lost tax, and

it was reasonable to expect the assessment to be made before that time limit.

in Scotland, a feu duty or a payment mentioned in section 56(1) of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000.
(4)
The grant of an option by a person binding the person to dispose of an interest in UK land is (so far as it would not otherwise be the case) regarded as a disposal of an interest in UK land by the person for the purposes of section 1A(3)(b).

(b)
whether the person making the disposal has a substantial indirect interest in the UK land at the time of the disposal.
(2)
The provision made by Schedule 1A is not to be taken as affecting the meaning of “substantial” in other contexts.
Deduction of allowable losses
1E
Losses deductible only when within scope of tax etc
(1)
A loss is not an allowable loss if it accrues in a tax year at a time when, had a gain accrued instead, the gain would not have been chargeable to capital gains tax under this Act for the tax year (and see also sections 16(2) and 16A).
(2)
In addition, the only allowable losses that qualify for deduction from chargeable gains under section 1A(3) (non-UK residents) are those accruing to the person on disposals of assets within that subsection.
(3)
An allowable loss counts for the purposes of subsection (2) even if it accrues in a tax year in which the person was UK resident.
(4)
No allowable losses may be deducted from chargeable gains treated as accruing to an individual as a result of section 87, 87K, 87L or 89(2) (read, where appropriate, with section 1M).
(5)
If—
(a)
amounts (or elements of amounts) treated as accruing to an individual as a result of section 86 relate to different settlements, and
(b)
the deduction of allowable losses does not reduce the amounts or elements to nil,
the deduction applicable to each amount is the proportion that the amount concerned bears to the total of the amounts.
(6)
The deduction of allowable losses also has effect subject to Schedule 1 (UK resident individuals not domiciled in UK).
(7)
For the only case in which an allowable loss accruing in a tax year may be carried back to an earlier tax year, see section 62 (death).
1F
Allowable losses to be used in most beneficial way etc
(1)
Allowable losses may (subject to express provision to the contrary) be deducted from gains in whichever way is most beneficial to a person chargeable to capital gains tax.
(2)
Accordingly, an allowable loss may be deducted from a chargeable gain irrespective of the rate of tax at which the gain would otherwise have been charged.
(3)
Allowable losses that are deducted from gains may not be deducted any further than is necessary to eliminate the gains.
(4)
No part of an allowable loss may be relieved under this Act more than once.
(5)
So far as an amount has been relieved under the Income Tax Acts, it may not be further relieved under this Act.
UK resident individuals with split tax years
1G
Gains accruing to UK resident individuals in split years
(1)
If, as respects any individual, a tax year is a split year, sections 1A(1) and 1E have effect subject to the modifications made by this section.
(2)
Gains accruing to the individual in the overseas part of the tax year are chargeable to capital gains tax only if they accrue on the disposal of assets within section 1A(3).
(3)
Losses are deductible from gains accruing to the individual in the overseas part of the tax year on the disposal of assets within section 1A(3)(b) or (c) only if the losses accrue to the individual on the disposal of—
(a)
assets that are within section 1A(3)(b) or (c), or
(b)
assets that would be within section 1A(3)(b) or (c) if they did not have a relevant connection to the individual's UK branch or agency.
(4)
But losses accruing in the overseas part of the tax year on disposals of assets within section 1A(3)(b) or (c) are (so far as not deducted as mentioned in subsection (3)) deductible from gains accruing in the UK part of the tax year.
Rates of CGT
1H
The main rates of CGT
(1)
This section makes provision about the rates at which capital gains tax is charged but has effect subject to—
(a)
section 169N (entrepreneurs' relief: rate of 10%), and
(b)
section 169VC (investors' relief: rate of 10%).
(2)
Chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to an individual that are—
(a)
residential property gains (see Schedule 1B), or
(b)
carried interest gains (see subsections (9) to (11)),
are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 18% or 28%.
(3)
Other chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to an individual are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 10% or 20%.
(4)
The question as to which of the rates applies to the gains concerned is determined by section 1I (income taxed at higher rates or gains exceeding unused basic rate band).
(5)
Chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to the personal representatives of a deceased individual that are—
(a)
residential property gains, or
(b)
carried interest gains,
are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 28%.
(6)
Other chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to the personal representatives of a deceased individual are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 20%.
(7)
Residential property gains accruing in a tax year to the trustees of a settlement are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 28%.
(8)
Other chargeable gains accruing in a tax year to the trustees of a settlement are charged to capital gains tax at a rate of 20%.
(9)
For the purposes of this section chargeable gains are “carried interest gains” if they accrue to an individual (“X”)—
(a)
under section 103KA(2) or (3) (investment management services), or
(b)
as a result of carried interest arising to X under arrangements not involving a partnership under which X performs investment management services directly or indirectly in respect of an investment scheme.
(10)
A gain is not a carried interest gain under subsection (9)(b) if the carried interest constitutes a co-investment repayment or return.
(11)
Expressions used in subsection (9) or (10) have the same meaning as they have in Chapter 5 of Part 3.
1I
Income taxed at higher rates or gains exceeding unused basic rate band
(1)
If any of an individual's income for a tax year is chargeable to income tax at a higher income tax rate, gains accruing to the individual in the tax year are charged—
(a)
at the rate of 28%(if they are residential property gains or carried interest gains), or
(b)
at the rate of 20% (if they are other kinds of gains).
(2)
If—
(a)
none of an individual's income for a tax year is chargeable to income tax at a higher income tax rate, but
(b)
the individual is chargeable to capital gains tax for the tax year on an amount that exceeds the unused part of the individual's basic rate band,
the excess (“the higher rate excess”) is charged at the rate of 28%(so far as comprising residential property gains or carried interest gains) or at the rate of 20% (so far as comprising other kinds of gains).
(3)
The remainder of this section sets out special rules which apply depending on the nature of the gains within subsection (2)(b).
(4)
If—
(a)
the gains consist of or include gains (“entrepreneur or investor gains”) chargeable at the rate of 10% under section 169N(3) or 169VC(2), and
(b)
the total amount of the entrepreneur or investor gains exceeds the unused part of the individual's basic rate band,
that unused part is used fully against those gains.
(5)
The effect of so doing is that other gains comprised in the higher rate excess are then charged—
(a)
at the rate of 28%(if they are residential property gains or carried interest gains), or
(b)
at the rate of 20% (if they are other kinds of gains).
(6)
If the total amount of the entrepreneur or investor gains does not exceed the unused part of the individual's basic rate band—
(a)
so much of that unused part as is equal to that total amount is used against those gains, and
(b)
accordingly, the higher rate excess consists only of gains other than entrepreneur or investor gains.
(7)
The individual may allocate so much of the unused part of the individual's basic rate band as then remains to—
(a)
any residential property gains or carried interest gains, or
(b)
any other gains.
(8)
The effect of the allocation is that the gains to which the allocation is made are charged—
(a)
at the rate of 18%(if they are residential property gains or carried interest gains), or
(b)
at the rate of 10% (if they are other kinds of gains).
(9)
Any gains to which no allocation is made are charged—
(a)
at the rate of 28%(if they are residential property gains or carried interest gains), or
(b)
at the rate of 20% (if they are other kinds of gains).
1J
Section 1I: definitions and other supplementary provision
(1)
For the purposes of section 1I—
a “higher income tax rate” means—
(a)
the higher rate or the default higher rate,
(b)
the savings higher rate, or
(c)
the dividend upper rate, and
“the unused part of the individual's basic rate band” means the amount by which the basic rate limit exceeds the individual's Step 3 income.
(2)
If an individual is entitled to relief for a tax year under section 539 of ITTOIA 2005 (contracts for life insurance) by reference to the amount of a deficiency, the individual's Step 3 income for the tax year is treated for the purposes of this section as reduced by the amount of the deficiency.
(3)
If, as a result of section 669(1) and (2) of ITTOIA 2005 (inheritance tax on accrued income), there is a reduction in the residuary income of an estate for a tax year that reduces an individual's income by any amount, the individual's Step 3 income for the tax year is treated for the purposes of this section as reduced by the amount of that reduction in the individual's income.
(4)
If an individual has life insurance gains for a tax year, the individual's Step 3 income for the tax year is treated for the purposes of this section as if the amount of those gains were limited to—
(a)
the annual equivalent within the meaning of section 536(1) of ITTOIA 2005, or
(b)
the total annual equivalent within the meaning of section 537 of that Act,
as the case may be.
(5)
If—
(a)
an individual has life insurance gains for a tax year,
(b)
relief is given under section 535 of ITTOIA 2005 for the tax year, and
(c)
the calculation under section 536(1) or 537 of that Act for the tax year does not involve the higher rate,
the individual is treated for the purposes of section 1I as if none of the individual's income were chargeable to income tax at the higher rate, the default higher rate or the dividend upper rate.
(6)
In the application of section 1I in the case of any individual it is to be assumed that the individual is not a Scottish or Welsh taxpayer.
(7)
In this section—
“the individual's Step 3 income” means so much of the individual's total income for the tax year as is left after taking Step 3 under section 23 of ITA 2007 (income tax liability calculation), and
“life insurance gains”, in relation to an individual, means the amount or amounts treated as the individual's income as a result of section 465 of ITTOIA 2005 (gains from contracts for life insurance).
(8)
Expressions used in this section which have a meaning when used in the Income Tax Acts have the same meaning in this section.
Annual exempt amount
1K
Annual exempt amount
(1)
If an individual is (or, apart from this section, would be) chargeable to capital gains tax for a tax year on chargeable gains, the annual exempt amount for the year is to be deducted from those gains (but no further than necessary to eliminate them).
(2)
The annual exempt amount for a tax year is £12,000.
(3)
The annual exempt amount may not be deducted from chargeable gains to which paragraph 2 of Schedule 1 applies (foreign gains of non-UK domiciled individuals accruing in one year and remitted in later year).
(4)
The deduction of the annual exempt amount—
(a)
is made after the deduction of allowable losses accruing in the tax year, but
(b)
is made before the deduction of allowable losses accruing in a previous tax year or, if section 62 applies, in a subsequent tax year.
(5)
The annual exempt amount may be deducted from gains in whatever way is most beneficial to a person chargeable to capital gains tax (irrespective of the rate of tax at which the gains would otherwise have been charged).
(6)
An individual is not entitled to an annual exempt amount for a tax year if section 809B of ITA 2007 (claim for remittance basis) applies to the individual for the year.
(7)
For the tax year in which an individual dies and for the next two tax years, this section applies to the individual's personal representatives as if references to the individual were to those personal representatives.
(8)
This section applies in relation to trustees in accordance with the provision made by Schedule 1C.
1L
Increasing annual exempt amount to reflect increases in CPI
(1)
If the consumer prices index for the September before the start of a tax year is higher than it was for the previous September—
(a)
the annual exempt amount is increased by the same percentage as the rise in that index (rounded up to the nearest £100), and
(b)
section 1K(2) has effect for the tax year (and subsequent tax years) as if it referred to the increased amount.
(2)
If, as a result of this section, the annual exempt amount for a tax year increases, the Treasury must before the start of the tax year make an order showing the increased amount.
Temporary periods of non-residence
1M
Temporary non-residents
(1)
If, in the case of the disposal of an asset by an individual who is temporarily non-resident—
(a)
a gain or loss accrues to the individual in the temporary period of non-residence, and
(b)
the asset is not excluded from this subsection by section 1N (certain assets acquired in that period),
the gain or loss is treated instead as accruing to the individual in the period of return.
(2)
If—
(a)
a gain is, as a result of subsection (1), treated as accruing to an individual in a tax year for which the remittance basis applies to the individual,
(b)
the tax year consists of or includes the period of return, and
(c)
the gain was remitted to the United Kingdom in the temporary period of non-residence,
the gain is treated instead as remitted to the United Kingdom in the period of return.
(3)
If—
(a)
an individual is temporarily non-resident, and
(b)
a gain would, as a result of section 86, have accrued to the individual in a tax year falling wholly or partly in the temporary period of non-residence if the individual had been resident in the United Kingdom for that year,
the gain is treated instead as accruing to the individual in the period of return (but see also section 86A).
(4)
Nothing in any double taxation arrangements prevents a charge to capital gains tax arising as a result of this section.
(5)
Nothing in this section is to affect a gain or loss which, apart from this section, would be chargeable to capital gains tax or would be an allowable loss.
(6)
For the purposes of this section each of the following expressions has the meaning given by Part 4 of Schedule 45 to the Finance Act 2013 (statutory residence test: anti-avoidance)—
“the period of return”
“temporarily non-resident”
“the temporary period of non-residence”.
(7)
In this section the reference to “the remittance basis” applying to an individual for a tax year is to section 809B, 809D or 809E of ITA 2007 applying to the individual for the year.
1N
Section 1M(1): assets acquired in temporary period of non-residence
(1)
An asset is excluded from section 1M(1) if—
(a)
it was acquired by the individual in the temporary period of non-residence,
(b)
the acquisition was otherwise than by means of a disqualifying no gain/no loss disposal,
(c)
there is no reduction in the consideration for the acquisition under section 23(4)(b) or (5)(b), 152(1)(b), 153(1)(b), 162(3)(b) or 247(2)(b) or (3)(b) by reference to a UK resident disposal, and
(d)
the asset is not an interest created by or arising under a settlement.
(2)
This exclusion does not apply in the case of an asset (“the new asset”) if—
(a)
on a disposal of the new asset a gain or loss is treated as a result of 116(10) or (11), 134 or 154(2) or (4) as accruing (ignoring section 1M),
(b)
the gain or loss is calculated by reference to another asset (“the old asset”), and
(c)
the new asset is one that meets the conditions for exclusion but the old asset does not.
(3)
For the purposes of this section “a UK resident disposal” means a disposal by a person (“P”) of an asset which was acquired by P at a time when—
(a)
P was resident in the United Kingdom, and
(b)
P was not Treaty non-resident.
(4)
For the purposes of this section “a disqualifying no gain/no loss disposal” means a UK resident disposal to which section 58, 73 or 258(4) applies.

so far as not previously deducted under this subsection, any allowable losses previously accruing to the company while it was within the charge to corporation tax.
(2)
For the purposes of corporation tax on gains “allowable loss” does not include a loss accruing to a company if, had a gain accrued, the company would not have been chargeable to corporation tax on the gain.
Territorial scope
2B
Territorial scope of charge to corporation tax on chargeable gains
(1)
A company which is resident in the United Kingdom in an accounting period is chargeable to corporation tax on chargeable gains accruing to the company in the period on the disposal of assets wherever situated.
(2)
This is subject to Chapter 3A of Part 2 of CTA 2009 (exemption from charge in respect of profits of foreign permanent establishments).
(3)
A company which is not resident in the United Kingdom is chargeable to corporation tax on chargeable gains that—
(a)
accrue to the company on the disposal of assets situated in the United Kingdom that have a relevant connection to the company's UK permanent establishment (see section 2C),
(b)
accrue at a time when it has that permanent establishment, and
(c)
are, in accordance with sections 20 to 32 of CTA 2009, attributable to that permanent establishment.
(4)
In addition, a company which is not resident in the United Kingdom is chargeable to corporation tax on chargeable gains accruing to the company on the disposal of assets not within subsection (3) that are—
(a)
interests in UK land, or
(b)
assets (wherever situated) not within paragraph (a) that derive at least 75% of their value from UK land where the company has a substantial indirect interest in that land.
(5)
Section 1C applies for the purposes of subsection (4)(a) as it applies for the purposes of section 1A(3)(b) (disposing of interests in UK land).
(6)
The reference in subsection (4)(b) to assets deriving at least 75% of their value from UK land where the company has a substantial indirect interest in that land is to be read in accordance with Schedule 1A.
2C
Non-UK resident company with UK permanent establishment
(1)
For the purposes of section 2B(3) a company has a UK permanent establishment at any time if, at that time, the company carries on a trade in the United Kingdom through a permanent establishment there.
(2)
For the purposes of section 2B(3) an asset has a relevant connection to a company's UK permanent establishment if—
(a)
it is, or was, used in or for the purposes of the trade at or before the time of the disposal,
(b)
it is, or was, used or held for the purposes of the permanent establishment at or before that time, or
(c)
it is acquired for use by or for the purposes of the permanent establishment.
(3)
Section 2B(3) does not apply to a company which, as a result of Part 2 of TIOPA 2010 (double taxation arrangements), is exempt from corporation tax for the accounting period in respect of the profits of the permanent establishment.
(4)
In the case of the long-term business of an overseas life insurance company, subsection (2) has effect as if for paragraph (b) there were substituted—
“(b)
it is, or was, used or held for the purposes of the permanent establishment at or before that time (irrespective of where it is situated at that time),”.
(5)
In this section references to a trade include an office and references to carrying on a trade include holding an office.
Application of CGT principles etc
2D
Application of CGT principles in calculating gains and losses
(1)
The total amount of chargeable gains to be included in a company's total profits for an accounting period is calculated for corporation tax purposes in accordance with capital gains tax principles.
(2)
All of the following questions are determined in accordance with the enactments relating to capital gains tax as if accounting periods were tax years—
(a)
any question as to the amounts to be, or not to be, taken into account as chargeable gains or allowable losses,
(b)
any question as to the amounts to be, or not to be, taken into account in calculating gains or losses,
(c)
any question as to the amounts charged to tax as a company's gains, and
(d)
any question as to the time when any amount is treated as accruing.
(3)
This section is subject to any provision made elsewhere by the Corporation Tax Acts.
2E
References to income tax or Income Tax Acts in case of companies
(1)
If the CGT enactments contain any reference to—
(a)
income tax, or
(b)
the Income Tax Acts,
the reference is, in relation to a company, to be read as a reference to corporation tax or the Corporation Tax Acts.
(2)
But—
(a)
this does not affect references to income tax in section 39(2), and
(b)
so far as the CGT enactments operate by reference to matters of any specified description, account is to be taken for corporation tax purposes of matters of that description confined to companies but not of any confined to individuals.
(3)
In this section “the CGT enactments” means the enactments relating to capital gains tax.
2F
Interaction of capital gains tax and corporation tax
(1)
This Act as it has effect in accordance with this Chapter is not to be affected in its operation by the fact that capital gains tax and corporation tax are distinct taxes.
(2)
But this Act is, so far as it is consistent with the Corporation Tax Acts, to apply in relation to capital gains tax and corporation tax on gains as if they were one tax.
(3)
Accordingly, a matter which in a case involving two individuals is relevant to both of them in relation to capital gains tax is in a similar case involving an individual and a company—
(a)
relevant to the individual in relation to capital gains tax, and
(b)
relevant to the company in relation to corporation tax.
Supplementary
2G
Assets of a company vested in a liquidator
(1)
If assets of a company are vested in a liquidator—
(a)
this Chapter, and
(b)
the enactments applied by this Chapter,
apply as if the assets were vested in the company and as if the acts of the liquidator in relation to the assets were the company's acts.
(2)
Accordingly, acquisitions from or disposals to the liquidator by the company are ignored.
(3)
The assets may be vested in the liquidator under section 145 of the Insolvency Act 1986 or Article 123 of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 or otherwise.
CHAPTER 3
Attribution of gains of non-UK resident close companies
Gains of non-UK resident companies not otherwise chargeable
3
Gains attributed to UK resident individuals etc
(1)
This section applies if—
(a)
a chargeable gain accrues at any time to a non-UK resident close company,
(b)
the gain is connected to avoidance (see section 3A),
(c)
the gain is not connected to a foreign trade or other economically significant foreign activities (see section 3A), and
(d)
apart from this section, some or all of the gain would not be chargeable to corporation tax on the company.
(2)
So much of the gain as would not otherwise be so chargeable is apportioned among participators, or indirect participators, in the company—
(a)
who are resident in the United Kingdom at that time, or
(b)
who are trustees of a settlement and are not resident in the United Kingdom at that time.
(3)
The proportion of the amount of the gain to be apportioned to each person corresponds to the extent of the person's interest in the company as a participator or indirect participator.
(4)
The amount apportioned to each person is treated as a chargeable gain accruing to the person.
(5)
No apportionment of any part of a gain is made to an individual if—
(a)
the gain accrues in a tax year which, as respects the individual, is a split year, and
(b)
the gain accrues in the overseas part of the year.
(6)
No apportionment of any part of a gain is made to a person if the total amount that would, apart from this subsection, be apportioned to—
(a)
the person, and
(b)
persons connected to the person,
is 25% or less of the amount of the gain falling to be apportioned.
(7)
A person (“P”) is an “indirect participator” in a company (“A”) if—
(a)
another company (“B”) which is a non-UK resident close company is a participator in A, and
(b)
P is a participator in B or P is a participator in a third non-UK resident close company which is participator in B,
and so on through any number of non-UK resident close companies that are participators in other non-UK resident close companies.
(8)
P's interest as an indirect participator in A in the case of any gain is determined by—
(a)
apportioning the gain among the participators in A according to the extent of their respective interests as participators, and
(b)
then further apportioning the gain apportioned to B among the participators in B according to the extent of their respective interests as participators, and so on through other companies.
(9)
So far as it would go to reduce or extinguish chargeable gains accruing, as a result of this section, to a person in a chargeable period, this section applies to a loss accruing to the company on the disposal of an asset in that period as it would apply if there had been a gain.
(10)
But—
(a)
this only applies in relation to that person, and
(b)
this section does not otherwise apply in relation to losses accruing to the company.
(11)
In this section “a non-UK resident close company” means a company—
(a)
which is not resident in the United Kingdom, and
(b)
which would be a close company if it were resident in the United Kingdom.
3A
Gains connected to avoidance or foreign activities etc
(1)
A gain accruing to a company on the disposal of an asset is taken to be “connected to avoidance” unless it is shown that neither—
(a)
the disposal of the asset by the company, nor
(b)
the acquisition or holding of the asset by the company,
formed part of a scheme or arrangements of which the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, was avoidance of liability to capital gains tax or corporation tax.
(2)
A gain is “connected to a foreign trade” if it accrues on the disposal of an asset used only—
(a)
for the purposes of a trade carried on by the company wholly outside the United Kingdom, or
(b)
for the purposes of the foreign part of a trade carried on by the company partly within, and partly outside, the United Kingdom,
and the reference here to the foreign part of a trade is to the part of the trade carried on outside the United Kingdom.
(3)
For this purpose an asset is to be regarded as used only for the purposes of a trade carried on by the company wholly outside the United Kingdom if—
(a)
the asset is accommodation, or an interest or right in accommodation, situated outside the United Kingdom, and
(b)
the accommodation has for each relevant period been furnished holiday accommodation of which a person has made a commercial letting.
(4)
Each of the following is a “relevant period”—
(a)
the period of 12 months ending with the date of the disposal and each of the two preceding periods of 12 months, or
(b)
if the company has beneficially owned the accommodation (or interest or right) for more than 36 months, the period of 12 months ending with the date of the disposal and each of the preceding periods of 12 months throughout which the company had that beneficial ownership.
(5)
The reference in this section to the commercial letting of furnished holiday accommodation is to be read in accordance with Chapter 6 of Part 4 of CTA 2009, but as if—
(a)
sections 266, 268 and 268A were omitted, and
(b)
the reference to an accounting period in section 267(1) were to a relevant period.
(6)
A gain accruing on the disposal of an asset is “connected to other economically significant foreign activities” if—
(a)
the asset is used only for the purposes of activities carried on by the company wholly or mainly outside the United Kingdom,
(b)
the activities consist of the provision of goods or services on a commercial basis, and
(c)
the activities also satisfy the staff, premises and economic value test.
(7)
Activities satisfy the staff, premises and economic value test if they involve—
(a)
the use of employees, agents or contractors of the company in numbers, and with competence and authority, commensurate with the size and nature of the activities,
(b)
the use of premises and equipment commensurate with the size and nature of the activities, and
(c)
the addition of economic value by the company to the persons to whom the goods or services are provided commensurate with the size and nature of the activities.
(8)
This section applies for the purposes of section 3(1)(b) and (c).
3B
Participators and their interests
(1)
“Participator” has the meaning given by section 454 of CTA 2010.
(2)
Any reference to a person's interest as a participator in a company is to the interest in it represented by all the factors by reference to which the person is a participator.
(3)
Any reference to the extent of a person's interest as a participator in a company is to such proportion of the interests as participators of all of the company's participators as, on a just and reasonable basis, is represented by that interest.
(4)
If—
(a)
the interest of a person in a company is wholly or partly represented by an interest under a settlement (“the beneficial interest”), and
(b)
the beneficial interest is the factor (or one of them) by reference to which the person would, apart from this subsection, have an interest as a participator in the company,
that interest as a participator is, so far as represented by the beneficial interest, to be treated instead as the interest of the trustees of the settlement.
(5)
If—
(a)
exempt assets of a pension scheme are taken into account in ascertaining a person's interest as a participator in a company, and
(b)
if those assets were ignored, an amount in respect of a gain accruing to the company would not be apportioned to the person as a result of section 3,
no amount in the respect of the gain is to be apportioned to the person as a result of that section.
(6)
For this purpose—
(a)
“assets of a pension scheme” means assets held for the purposes of a fund or scheme to which section 271(1)(c) or (1A) applies, and
(b)
those assets are “exempt” if, at the time when the gain accrues, a disposal of those assets would be exempt from tax as a result of either of those provisions.
(7)
This section applies for the purposes of section 3.
Prevention of multiple charges
3C
Prevention of double UK taxation
(1)
If—
(a)
an amount of tax is paid by a person as a result of section 3 in respect of a gain, and
(b)
there is a distribution of an amount in respect of the gain before the end of the relevant period,
the amount of tax is applied so as to reduce or extinguish any liability of the person to tax in respect of the distribution.
(2)
For the purposes of subsection (1)—
(a)
the distribution is one made by way of dividend or distribution of capital or on the dissolution of the company,
(b)
the tax in respect of the distribution is income tax, corporation tax or capital gains tax, and
(c)
in determining the liability to tax of any individual in respect of any distribution for a tax year it is to be assumed that the distribution is the highest part of the individual's income for the year.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (1) “the relevant period” means the period of 3 years from the end of whichever of the following periods is earlier—
(a)
the period of account of the company in which the gain accrued, and
(b)
the period of 12 months beginning with the date on which the gain accrued.
(4)
The amount of tax paid by a person as a result of section 3 is allowable as a deduction in calculating a chargeable gain accruing on the disposal by the person of any asset representing the person's interest as a participator in the company.
(5)
An amount of tax—
(a)
is not to be used more than once under this section (whether to reduce or extinguish a liability or as a deduction or a combination of those things), and
(b)
is not to be applied if it is reimbursed by the company.
Non-UK domiciled individuals and temporary non-residents
3D
Non-UK domiciled individuals
(1)
This section applies if, as a result of section 3, an amount in respect of a gain accruing to a company in a tax year is apportioned to an individual who is not domiciled in the United Kingdom in that year.
(2)
The apportioned amount is regarded for the purposes of paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 as accruing on a disposal of a foreign asset if the asset disposed of by the company is a foreign asset (but not otherwise).
(3)
For the purposes of Chapter A1 of Part 14 of ITA 2007 (remittance basis)—
(a)
treat any consideration obtained by the company on the disposal of the asset as deriving from the apportioned amount, and
(b)
if that consideration is less than the market value of the asset, treat the asset as deriving from the apportioned amount.
(4)
The apportioned amount may not be reduced or extinguished by a loss under section 3 if—
(a)
the apportioned amount is regarded for the purposes of paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 as accruing on a disposal of a foreign asset,
(b)
the remittance basis applies to the individual for the tax year in question, and
(c)
any of the apportioned amount is remitted to the United Kingdom in a subsequent tax year.
(5)
Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 applies for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of that Schedule.
3E
Temporary non-residents
(1)
This section applies if—
(a)
an individual is temporarily non-resident, and
(b)
a gain or loss accrues to a company in a tax year falling wholly or partly in the temporary period of non-residence.
(2)
So much of the gain as would, as a result of section 3, have been treated as accruing to the individual in the tax year if the residence assumption were made is to be treated as accruing to the individual in the period of return.
(3)
But if—
(a)
the remittance basis applies to the individual for the tax year that comprises or includes the period of return, and
(b)
any part of the gain has not been remitted to the United Kingdom before the period of the return,
subsection (2) has effect subject to the further application of Schedule 1 (as read with section 3D) in relation to that part of the gain.
(4)
Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 applies for the purposes of subsection (3) as it applies for the purposes of that Schedule.
(5)
So much of the loss accruing in the tax year as would, in accordance with section 3(9), have reduced or extinguished a gain treated as accruing to the individual in that year as a result of section 3 if the residence assumption were made is to be treated as accruing to the individual in the period of return.
(6)
For the purposes of this section the “residence assumption” is—
(a)
that the individual was resident in the United Kingdom for the tax year in which the gain or loss accrued to the company, and
(b)
that the tax year was not a split year as respects the individual.
(7)
Nothing in any double taxation arrangements prevents a charge to capital gains tax arising as a result of this section.
(8)
For the purposes of this section each of the following expressions has the meaning given by Part 4 of Schedule 45 to the Finance Act 2013 (statutory residence test: anti-avoidance)—
“the period of return”
“temporarily non-resident”
“the temporary period of non-residence”.
Application to groups

(e)
section 175(1) but as if “to which this section applies” were omitted, and
(f)
section 179 but as if subsections (1)(b) and (1A) were omitted, as if for any reference to a group of companies there were substituted a reference to a non-resident group of companies and as if for any reference to a company there were substituted a reference to a non-resident company.
(3)
In this section—
“non-resident company” means a company which is not resident in the United Kingdom,
“non-resident group of companies”—
(a)
in the case of a group none of whose members are resident in the United Kingdom, means that group, and
(b)
in the case of a group some of whose members are not resident in the United Kingdom, means the members which are not resident in the United Kingdom, and
“group” is to be read in accordance with section 170.

3G
Supplementary provisions

If tax payable by a person (“P”) as a result of section 3 is paid by—
(a)
the company (“C”) to which the gain accrues, or
(b)
a company by reference to which P is regarded as an indirect participator in C,
the amount paid is not a payment to P for tax purposes.

The reference here to tax purposes is to the purposes of income tax, capital gains tax or corporation tax.
(3)
For the purposes of section 3 the amount of a gain or loss accruing to a company is calculated as if the company were a company resident in the United Kingdom chargeable to corporation tax on the gain.”3

(3)
The period does not create a change of the individual's residence or domicile.

UK resident individuals not domiciled in UK
Foreign gains treated as accruing when remitted to UK
1
(1)
This paragraph applies in the case of an individual to whom the remittance basis applies for a tax year if—
(a)
in that year the individual disposes of foreign assets,
(b)
chargeable gains accrue to the individual on the disposal of those assets, and
(c)
the gains are not taken outside the charge to capital gains tax as a result of section 1G (cases where tax year is a split year).
(2)
The gains are treated as accruing to the individual only so far as, and at the time when, they are remitted to the United Kingdom.
(3)
The amount treated as accruing is equal to the full amount remitted to the United Kingdom at that time.
Use of allowable losses against foreign gains remitted in later year
2
(1)
This paragraph applies if—
(a)
gains are treated as accruing to an individual in a tax year as a result of paragraph 1,
(b)
the tax year is later than the one (“the actual year of accrual”) in which those gains actually accrued to the individual, and
(c)
an election under section 16ZA (election for foreign losses to be allowable losses) has effect for both the tax year and the actual year of accrual.
(2)
No allowable losses may be deducted under section 1 from the gains.
(3)
This prohibition—
(a)
applies regardless of whether or not the allowable losses accrue on disposals of foreign assets, but
(b)
does not prevent the prior application of paragraph 3(3) in relation to the gains (which contains a rule for reducing the amount of the gains by reference to losses).
Matching rules for relieving allowable losses
3
(1)
This paragraph applies in the case of an individual for a tax year if—
(a)
the remittance basis applies to the individual for the tax year, and
(b)
an election under section 16ZA has effect for the tax year.
(2)
Allowable losses accruing to the individual must be matched to chargeable gains accruing to the individual in accordance with paragraph 4.
(3)
If allowable losses are matched to chargeable gains accruing on disposals of foreign assets—
(a)
which actually accrue in the tax year, but
(b)
which are, as a result of paragraph 1, treated as not accruing in the tax year,
the amount of those gains is reduced by the matched amount (and the allowable losses are reduced accordingly).
(4)
So far as allowable losses are matched to other chargeable gains, they are deducted from chargeable gains accruing to the individual in the tax year.
(5)
This is subject to—
(a)
paragraph 2 (no use of allowable losses against foreign gains remitted in later year), and
(b)
section 1E(4) (prohibition of deduction of losses from gains treated as accruing under section 87, 87K, 87L or 89(2)).
Rules for matching losses to chargeable gains
4
(1)
This paragraph explains how, for the purposes of paragraph 3, allowable losses are matched to chargeable gains in the case of an individual to whom that paragraph applies for a tax year.
(2)
The losses are matched to the gains in the following order—
first, gains actually accruing to the individual in the tax year on the disposal of foreign assets so far as they are remitted to the United Kingdom in the tax year;
second, gains actually accruing to the individual in the tax year on the disposal of foreign assets so far as they are not remitted to the United Kingdom in the tax year;
third, any other gains accruing to the individual in the tax year.
(3)
If the tax year is a split year, the matching under the first and second steps is to be done by reference to the extent to which the gains are, or are not, remitted in the UK part of the year.
(4)
If there are losses to be matched to gains under the second step but the losses are insufficient to eliminate the gains—
(a)
the losses are to be matched against gains accruing on the most recent day first (and then the next most recent day and so on until none of the losses remain), and
(b)
if losses cannot be matched fully against gains accruing on a particular day, the appropriate portion of the losses is matched against each of the gains.
(5)
“The appropriate portion” means the amount of each gain accruing on the day divided by the total amount of all of the gains accruing on the day.
Definitions

(1)
For the purposes of this Schedule “foreign asset” means an asset situated outside the United Kingdom.
(2)
For the purposes of this Schedule any reference to “the remittance basis” applying to an individual for a tax year is to section 809B, 809D or 809E of ITA 2007 applying to the individual for the year.
(3)
For the purposes of this Schedule any question as to whether, and when, amounts are “remitted to the United Kingdom” is determined in accordance with the rules in Chapter A1 of Part 14 of ITA 2007.”14

“SCHEDULE 1A
Assets deriving 75% of value from UK land etc
PART 1
Introduction
1
This Schedule makes provision, for the purposes of section 1A(3)(c) or 2B(4)(b), for determining in the case of any disposal of any asset—
(a)
whether the asset derives at least 75% of its value from UK land (see Part 2 of this Schedule), and
(b)
whether the person making the disposal has a substantial indirect interest in the UK land (see Part 3 of this Schedule).
2
The provision made by this Schedule needs to be read together with—
(a)
paragraph 5 of Schedule 5AAA (which treats units in a CoACS as shares for the purposes of this Schedule), and
(b)
paragraph 6 of that Schedule (which treats certain disposals of interests in collective investment vehicles as meeting the conditions in Part 3 of this Schedule).
PART 2
Whether asset derives at least 75% of its value from UK land
The basic rule
3
(1)
An asset derives at least 75% of its value from UK land if—
(a)
the asset consists of a right or an interest in a company, and
(b)
at the time of the disposal, at least 75% of the total market value of the company's qualifying assets derives (directly or indirectly) from interests in UK land.
(2)
Market value may be traced through any number of companies, partnerships, trusts and other entities or arrangements but may not be traced through a normal commercial loan.
(3)
It is irrelevant whether the law under which a company, partnership, trust or other entity or an arrangement is established or has effect is—
(a)
the law of any part of the United Kingdom, or
(b)
the law of any territory outside the United Kingdom.
(4)
The assets held by a company, partnership or trust or other entity or arrangement must be attributed to the shareholders, partners, beneficiaries or other participants at each stage in whatever way is appropriate in the circumstances.
(5)

the disposal has an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle (see sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) for the cases in which this test is met).
(2)
For the purposes of section 1A(3)(c) or 2B(4)(b) (disposals by non-UK residents of assets deriving 75% of value from UK land etc), the person is treated as having a substantial indirect interest in the UK land at the time of the disposal.
(3)
A disposal has an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle if the asset disposed of consists of a right or interest in—
(a)
a collective investment vehicle, or
(b)
a company at least half of whose market value derives from its being a direct or indirect participant in one or more collective investment vehicles.
(4)

(a)
the vehicle is constituted by two or more persons carrying on a trade or business in partnership, and

(a)
a company (which is not the vehicle) makes the disposal, and
(b)
the vehicle, and one or more other collective investment vehicles that are UK property rich, have a 50% investment in the company.
(7)
Collective investment vehicles have a 50% investment in a company if, applying the rule in paragraph 9 (but without regard to paragraph 10) of Schedule 1A as if references to 25% were references to 50%, the vehicles would be regarded as having a 50% investment in the company at the time of the disposal.
(8)
For this purpose the collective investment schemes are to be regarded as if they were a single person.
(9)
This paragraph is subject to paragraph 7 (collective investment vehicles expected to have no more than 40% investments in UK land).

(1)
This paragraph applies to a disposal which would otherwise have an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle as a result of paragraph 6(3), (5) or (6).
(2)
A disposal does not have an appropriate connection to a collective investment vehicle if, at the time of the disposal, the vehicle mentioned in paragraph 6(3)(a) or (5) or (6), or each of the vehicles mentioned in paragraph 6(3)(b), meets—
(a)
the non-UK real estate condition, and

(3)
If—
(a)
a disposal is made as mentioned in paragraph 6(6), and
(b)
the vehicle mentioned there is constituted by two or more persons carrying on a trade or business in partnership,
the condition in sub-paragraph (2)(b) is taken to be met if the company mentioned in paragraph 6(6) meets the non-close condition.
(4)
A vehicle meets the non-UK real estate condition at any time if, by reference to the prospectus for the vehicle as the prospectus has effect at that time, no more than 40% of the expected market value of the vehicle's investments is intended to derive from investments consisting of—

interests in UK land, or
(b)
rights or interests in companies which are UK property rich.
(5)
A vehicle meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition at any time if, at that time—
(a)
it meets conditions A to C of regulation 75 of the Offshore Funds (Tax) Regulations 2009, or
(b)
it meets the condition in regulation 75(5) of those Regulations,
and those Regulations apply for the purposes of this sub-paragraph as if any collective investment vehicle which is not an offshore fund were regarded as an offshore fund.
(6)
A company meets the non-close condition at any time if, at that time, it—
(a)
is not a close company, or
(b)
is a close company but only because it has a qualifying investor as a direct or indirect participator.

Paragraph 46 (meaning of “close company”, “qualifying investor” and “direct or indirect participator”) applies for the purposes of sub-paragraph (6).
PART 3
Election for transparency
Election for collective investment vehicle to be treated as partnership
8
(1)
This paragraph applies to an offshore collective investment vehicle—
(a)
which is UK property rich, and
(b)
which is transparent for income tax purposes otherwise than as a result of being constituted by two or more persons carrying on a trade or business in partnership.

The manager of the vehicle may make an election for the vehicle to be treated for the purposes of—
(a)
this Act, and
(b)
the Management Act, and any other provision of the Corporation Tax Acts, so far as relating to the taxation of chargeable gains,
as if, in relation to all times on and after its constitution, it were to be regarded as a partnership.
(3)
Accordingly, as a result of sub-paragraph (2)(b), it follows that, in applying rules such as section 1154 of CTA 2010 (meaning of “75% subsidiary” etc) for the purposes of Part 12 of that Act (Real Estate Investment Trusts) so far as relating to the taxation of chargeable gains, the vehicle is to be regarded as a partnership.
(4)
In the case of section 12AA of the Management Act as it applies as a result of sub-paragraph (2), a notice under subsection (2) or (3) of that section may be given to the manager of the vehicle.
(5)
The election has effect whether or not the vehicle would, but for the making of the election, be regarded as a person chargeable to capital gains tax or corporation tax on chargeable gains.
(6)
For the purposes of this paragraph whether or not an offshore collective investment vehicle is regarded as being UK property rich may be determined by reference to the prospectus for the vehicle on the assumption that investments are made by the vehicle in accordance with the prospectus.
(7)
For the purposes of this paragraph a collective investment vehicle is “transparent for income tax purposes” if, on the assumption that there are participants who are individuals resident in the United Kingdom, any sums which form part of the income of the vehicle—
(a)
would be chargeable to income tax on those assumed participants under a provision specified in section 830(2) of ITTOIA 2005 in respect of such of those sums as would be referable to their interests, or
(b)
if any of that income is derived from assets within the United Kingdom, would be so chargeable had the assets been outside the United Kingdom.
(8)
If an election is made under this paragraph in relation to a collective investment vehicle—
(a)
section 99 (application of Act to unit trust schemes) does not apply in relation to the vehicle, and
(b)
section 103D (tax transparent funds) does not apply in relation to the vehicle.

(b)
must be made by notice given to an officer of Revenue and Customs, and
(c)
must be made before the end of the period of 12 months beginning with the relevant acquisition date.
(2)

an interest in UK land, or
(b)
a right or interest in a company that is UK property rich,
forms part of the property that is the subject of or held by the vehicle.

Relationship to re-basing rules under Schedule 4AA for non-UK residents
11
(1)
This paragraph applies if—
(a)
an election under paragraph 8 has effect in relation to an offshore collective investment vehicle, and
(b)
as a result of the election, Part 3 or 4 of Schedule 4AA would (but for this paragraph) apply in relation to a disposal made by a participant in the vehicle.
(2)
The disposal is to be regarded for the purposes of Schedule 4AA as if it were one to which Part 2 of that Schedule applies.

(5)
For the purposes of this paragraph a company meets the non-close condition at any time if, at that time, it—

14
(1)
An election under paragraph 12 has effect only if it is accompanied by information of such description as may be specified by an officer of Revenue and Customs about disposals made by participants in the relevant fund at any time in—
(a)
the period of two years ending with the day before the day on which the election is made, or
(b)
if shorter, the period beginning with the constitution of the relevant fund and ending with the day before the day on which the election is made.
(2)
Information is not required by sub-paragraph (1) to accompany the election so far as—
(a)
it has already been provided to an officer of Revenue and Customs in a form and manner, and at times, specified by an officer of Revenue and Customs, and
(b)
the election sets out those occasions on which the information has been so provided.
15
(1)
An election under paragraph 12 has effect subject to such conditions as to the provision of information or documents to an officer of Revenue and Customs as may be specified by an officer of Revenue and Customs.
(2)
The information or documents must be provided to an officer of Revenue and Customs in respect of every period of account of the relevant fund which ends at a time when the election has effect.

(b)
an officer of Revenue and Customs (whether or not designated) may waive a breach of any provision made by or under this paragraph if, in the officer's opinion, there is no reasonable excuse for the breach but, having regard to all the circumstances, the breach is nonetheless insignificant.

Exemption for direct or indirect disposals of UK land by persons in which fund invests

(2)
If—
(a)
the disposal is a direct disposal of any of the relevant UK property by a person, and

(a)
the interests in UK land in question consist of or include any of the relevant UK property, and
(b)
immediately before the disposal, Q has a 40% investment in the company in question,
the appropriate proportion of any gain accruing to the person on the disposal is not a chargeable gain.
(4)
For the purposes of this paragraph the “appropriate proportion” means the proportion that so much of the consideration for the disposal as forms part (directly or indirectly) of the assets of Q bears to the total consideration for the disposal.
(5)
For the purposes of this paragraph a person has a 40% investment in a company if, applying the rule in paragraph 9 (but without regard to paragraph 10) of Schedule 1A as if references to 25% were references to 40%, the person would be regarded as having a 40% investment in the company immediately before the disposal.
(6)
In this paragraph—
“the interests in UK land in question” means the interests in UK land taken into account in determining whether the disposal is an indirect disposal of UK land, and
“the company in question”, in relation to a disposal of a right or interest in a company by the person, means that company.
(7)
If an officer of Revenue and Customs considers that the operation of this paragraph would otherwise result in the total proportion of a gain that is not a chargeable gain exceeding the whole of the gain, the officer may make such adjustments to the appropriate proportion of a gain accruing to any person as the officer considers just and reasonable to prevent that result.

23
(1)

paragraph 21, or
(b)
paragraph 22 but only as a result of paragraph 20 (qualifying fund or qualifying company ceasing to meet the applicable exemption conditions).
(2)

(3)
If, at the time of the deemed disposal or a subsequent time—

28
(1)

a participant in the relevant fund disposes of a unit in the relevant fund,
(b)
the participant is a company which is wholly owned by one or more investors to which this paragraph applies, and
(c)
the participant is not a collective investment vehicle,
any gain accruing on the disposal is not a chargeable gain.

Each of the following is an investor to which this paragraph applies—
(a)
any person who is a qualifying institutional investor within the meaning of Schedule 7AC (substantial shareholding exemption),

a company carrying on long-term business none of which is BLAGAB where, immediately before the disposal, its right or interest in the participant is an asset held for the purposes of its long-term business, and

some or all of the ownership of the qualifying institutional investors in the investing company is through the company which is Q for the purposes of paragraph 16(3).

Relationship between rules in this Part and REIT rules in Part 12 of CTA 2010
35
(1)
Nothing in this Part of this Schedule is to exempt so much of any qualifying REIT gain as accrues on a disposal made by a company which is, or is a member of, a UK REIT.
(2)
A chargeable gain is a “qualifying REIT gain” so far as—
(a)
the gain is not a chargeable gain as a result of section 535 or 535A of CTA 2010, and
(b)
the gain is not one falling to be exempted as a result of the application of either of those sections following a notice given under section 586(1) or 587(1) of that Act (venturing group).
(3)
In this paragraph “UK REIT” has the same meaning as in Part 12 of CTA 2010.
36
(1)
This paragraph applies if—
(a)
a gain accrues on a disposal made by a company (“the JV company”) which is a member of a group UK REIT,
(b)
the gain is one falling to be exempted as a result of the application of section 535 or 535A of CTA 2010 following a notice given under section 586(1) or 587(1) of that Act (venturing group),
(c)
the principal company of the group UK REIT that gave the notice is covered by an election made under paragraph 12 in respect of a qualifying fund, and
(d)
the JV company is also covered by the election.
(2)
The amount of the gain accruing to the JV company which is not a chargeable gain as a result of the operation, by reference to the election, of the rules in this Part of this Schedule—
(a)
is found by first taking the two steps mentioned below (which require the application of each of the exemption rules without regard to the other), and
(b)
once those two steps are taken, is so much of the amount found by the first step as exceeds the amount found by the second step.
(3)
The first step is, ignoring the effect of Part 12 of CTA 2010, to apply the rules in this Part of this Schedule that operate by reference to the election to identify the amount of the gain which (but for this paragraph) would not be chargeable.
(4)
The second step is, ignoring the effect of this Part of this Schedule, to apply the rules in Part 12 of CTA 2010 that operate in relation to the group UK REIT to identify the amount of the gain accruing to the JV company which falls to be exempted as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b).
(5)
In the case of a disposal, a company is “covered by an election made under paragraph 12” for the purposes of this paragraph if the disposal is one to which paragraph 16 applies where the election concerned is the one referred to in this paragraph.
(6)
In this paragraph “group UK REIT” has the same meaning as in Part 12 of CTA 2010.

If—
(a)
a person disposes of a right or interest in a company on which a gain or loss accrues, and
(b)
proportions of the gain or loss are not chargeable or allowable as a result of the operation of any relevant exemption provision,
each relevant exemption provision is to work separately (without regard to the other) in relation to each proportion of the gain or loss to which the relevant exemption provision applies.
(2)
Accordingly—
(a)
each relevant exemption provision is to operate by reference to the whole of the gain or loss (ignoring the effect of the other relevant exemption provision), and
(b)
the total proportion of the gain or loss which is not chargeable or allowable is the total of the proportions separately found (but not so as to exceed the whole amount of the gain or loss).
(3)
Each of the following is a “relevant exemption provision” for the purposes of this paragraph—
(a)
any provision made by this Part of this Schedule,
(b)
any provision made by paragraph 3A of Schedule 7AC, and
(c)
any provision made by Part 12 of CTA 2010.

(3)

Gains: disposals of rights or interests in UK property rich companies
(1)

a company (“A”) which is, or is a member of, a UK REIT disposes of an asset, and
(b)
the asset consists of a right or an interest in a company (“B”) which is UK property rich.
(2)
The appropriate proportion of a gain accruing to A on the disposal is not a chargeable gain.
(3)
The asset disposed of is regarded for the purposes of section 550 as used for the purposes of A's property rental business to an extent equal to the appropriate proportion.
(4)
In the case of a non-UK member of a group UK REIT, this section has effect as if any reference to property rental business of the member were to its UK property rental business.
(5)
In relation to a disposal of a right or interest in B—
(a)
B is “UK property rich” for the purposes of this section if the disposal would be regarded for the purposes of Schedule 1A to TCGA 1992 as a disposal of an asset deriving at least 75% of its value from UK land, and
(b)
any reference in this section to “the appropriate proportion” is to the proportion that, at the beginning of the accounting period in which the disposal is made, the value of B's relevant PRB assets bears to the total value of B's assets.
(6)
For the purposes of subsection (5)(b)—
(a)
“the value of B's relevant PRB assets” means the value of B's assets deriving (directly or indirectly) from assets used for the purposes of UK property rental business,
(b)

(7)
Any reference in this section to the disposal of a right or interest in B includes the disposal of a right or interest in an offshore collective investment vehicle (a “relevant fund”)—
(a)
to which paragraph 8 of Schedule 5AAA to TCGA 1992 applies, but
(b)
in relation to which an election under that paragraph has not been made.
(8)
In the case of a disposal which is, as a result of subsection (7), a disposal of a right or interest in B, the value of B's relevant PRB assets for the purposes of subsection (5)(b) is taken to be—
(a)
the value of B's assets that are used for the purposes of UK property rental business, plus
(b)
the value of B's assets deriving indirectly from assets held by a relevant fund that are used for the purposes of UK property rental business.
(9)
This section is to be read as if it were contained in TCGA 1992.
(10)
Apart from subsection (7) of section 535, nothing else in that section applies in relation to a disposal to which this section applies.

This section does not apply to a gain—

have not been deducted from (or taken into account in calculating) other profits or gains (of any kind) of the company or any other person, and
(b)
have not previously been deducted under this subsection,
may be deducted from the gain.
(2)
For this purpose “pre-April 2019 residual business losses or deficits” means—
(a)
allowable losses accruing on disposals made before 6 April 2019, or
(b)
deficits or other losses for accounting periods ending before that date,
which would otherwise have been deducted from (or taken into account in calculating) profits or gains (of any kind) accruing to residual business of the company.
(3)
If an accounting period (a “straddling period”) begins before and ends on or after 6 April 2019—
(a)
so much of the straddling period as falls before that date, and so much of it as falls on or after that date, are to be treated as separate accounting periods, and
(b)
if it is necessary to apportion an amount for the straddling period to the two separate accounting periods, it is to be apportioned—
(i)
on a time basis according to the respective length of the separate accounting periods, or
(ii)
if that would produce a result that is unjust or unreasonable, on a just and reasonable basis.”116
In section 547 (funds awaiting reinvestment), at the end insert—
“(6)

(c)
C disposes of any of its rights or interests in the relevant UK property rich company,
(d)
the disposal is made within the period of 3 years beginning with the completion of the development, and
(e)
if C is a member of a UK REIT, the disposal is not to another member of the UK REIT.
(3B)
If this subsection applies, section 535A is not to apply in relation to so much of the amount of a gain accruing on the disposal as relates to the property which has been developed.
(3C)
For the purposes of subsection (3A)—
(a)
a company is a “relevant UK property rich company” if, as a result of section 535A, any part of a gain accruing to C on a disposal of a right or interest in the company would not be a chargeable gain, and

(1)
Arrangements are “profit fragmentation arrangements” if—

provision has been made or imposed as between the resident party and the overseas party by means of the arrangements (“the material provision”),
(b)
as a result of the material provision, value is transferred from the resident party to the overseas party which derives directly or indirectly from the profits of a business chargeable to income tax or corporation tax (see paragraph 3),

But arrangements are not “profit fragmentation arrangements” if—

(3)
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(a) provision made or imposed as between a partnership of which the resident party is a member and the overseas party is to be regarded as provision made or imposed as between the resident party and the overseas party.3
(1)
In determining whether value deriving directly or indirectly from a business is transferred from the resident party to the overseas party, account is to be taken of any method, however indirect, by which—
(a)
any property or right is transferred or transmitted, or
(b)
the value of any property or right is enhanced or diminished.
(2)
Sub-paragraph (1) applies in particular to—
(a)
sales, contracts and other transactions made otherwise than for full consideration or for more than full consideration,

share capital or other rights in a company,

rights in a partnership, or
(iii)
an interest in settled property,
(c)
the creation of an option affecting the disposition of any property or right and the giving of consideration for granting it,

(e)
the creation of an embargo affecting such a disposition and the giving of consideration for releasing it, and
(f)

(a)
it is reasonable to conclude that some or all of the value transferred as a result of the material provision relates to something done by, or any property or purported right of, the individual, and
(b)
either of the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) is met.
(2)
The conditions are that—
(a)
under the arrangements—
(i)
the value transferred, or part of it, is so dealt with by any person as to be calculated at some time to enure for the benefit of the individual,
(ii)
the value transferred, or part of it, operates to increase the value of any assets which the individual holds or are held for the benefit of the individual,
(iii)
the individual receives or is entitled to receive any benefit provided or to be provided out of the value transferred or part of it,
(iv)
the individual may become entitled to the beneficial enjoyment of the value transferred, or part of it, if one or more powers are exercised or successively exercised (and for those purposes it does not matter who may exercise the powers or whether they are exercisable with or without the consent of another person), or
(v)
the individual (whether acting alone or together with any other person) is able in any manner to control directly or indirectly the application of the value transferred or part of it, or
(b)
it is reasonable to conclude that the individual (whether acting alone or with any other person) procured the transfer of value from the resident party to the overseas party in such a way as to avoid the conditions in paragraph (a) being met.
(3)
In determining whether the conditions in sub-paragraph (2)(a) are met in relation to an individual and the value transferred as a result of the material provision, all benefits which may at any time accrue to a person as a result of the value being transferred must be taken into account, irrespective of—
(a)
the nature or form of the benefits, or
(b)
whether the person has legal or equitable rights in respect of the benefits.
(4)
For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), references to an individual include a reference to any person connected with that individual and, for the purposes of this paragraph, section 993 of ITA 2007 (meaning of “connected”) has effect but as if—

subsection (4) of that section were omitted, and
(b)
members of a partnership in which the individual is also a member were not “associates” of the individual for the purposes of sections 450 and 451 of CTA 2010 (“control”).
(5)
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4), an individual is treated as connected with a person or entity if—
(a)
the individual or a person connected with the individual (whether acting alone or with any other person)—
(i)
is able to secure that the person or entity acts in accordance with the wishes of the individual or any person connected with the individual,
(ii)
is able to acquire rights which would enable the individual or any person connected with the individual to secure that the person or entity acts in accordance with the wishes of the individual or any person connected with the individual, or

is able to exercise significant influence over the person or entity (whether or not as a result of a legal entitlement of the individual or any person connected with the individual), or
(b)
the person or entity can reasonably be expected to act, or typically acts, in accordance with the wishes of the individual or a person connected with the individual.5
(1)
The material provision results in a tax mismatch for a tax period of the resident party if—
(a)
in that period, in relation to a relevant tax, it results in one or both of—
(i)
an increase in the expenses of the resident party for which a deduction is taken into account in calculating the amount of the relevant tax payable by the resident party, or
(ii)
a reduction in the income of the resident party which would otherwise have been taken into account in calculating the amount of the relevant tax payable by the resident party,
(b)
it is reasonable to conclude that—
(i)
the resulting reduction in the amount of the relevant tax which is payable by the resident party exceeds the resulting increase in relevant taxes payable by the overseas party for the period corresponding to the tax period, and
(ii)
the overseas party does not meet the 80% payment test, and
(c)
the results described in paragraphs (a) and (b)(i) are not exempted by sub-paragraph (5).
(2)
In this Schedule references to “the tax reduction” are to the amount of the excess mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b)(i).
(3)
It does not matter whether the tax reduction results from the application of different rates of tax, the operation of a relief, the exclusion of any amount from a charge to tax, or otherwise.
(4)
“The 80% payment test” is met by the overseas party if the resulting increase in relevant taxes paid by that party as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b)(i) is at least 80% of the amount of the resulting reduction in the amount of the relevant tax payable by the resident party.
(5)
The results described in sub-paragraph (1)(a) and (b)(i) are exempted if they arise solely by reason of—
(a)
contributions paid by an employer under a registered pension scheme, or overseas pension scheme, in respect of any individual,
(b)
a payment to a charity,
(c)
a payment to a person who, on the ground of sovereign immunity, cannot be liable for any relevant tax, or
(d)
a payment to an offshore fund or authorised investment fund—
(i)
which meets the genuine diversity of ownership condition (whether or not a clearance has been given to that effect), or
(ii)
at least 75% of the investors in which are, throughout the accounting period, registered pension schemes, overseas pension schemes, charities or persons who cannot be liable for any relevant tax on the ground of sovereign immunity.
(6)
In this paragraph and paragraph 6, where the overseas party does not have an actual period for the purposes of relevant taxes which coincides with the tax period of the resident party—
(a)
references to the corresponding period of the overseas party in relation to that tax period are to a notional period of that party for the purposes of relevant taxes that would coincide with that tax period, and
(b)
such apportionments as are just and reasonable are to be made to determine the income or tax liability of that party for that corresponding period.
(7)
In this paragraph—
“relevant tax” means—
(a)
income tax,
(b)
corporation tax on income,
(c)
a sum chargeable under section 269DA of CTA 2010 (surcharge on banking companies) as if it were an amount of corporation tax,
(d)
a sum chargeable under section 330(1) of CTA 2010 (supplementary charge in respect of ring fence trades as if it were an amount of corporation tax), or
(e)
any non-UK tax on income, and
“tax period”, in relation to a resident party, means—
(a)
a tax year, or
(b)
if the resident party is a company, an accounting period of that party.6
(1)
For the purposes of paragraph 5, the resulting reduction in the resident party's liability to a relevant tax for a tax period is—
where—
A is the sum of—
(a)
if there are expenses within paragraph 5(1)(a)(i), the lower of the amount of expenses and the amount of the deduction mentioned in that provision, and
(b)
any reduction in income mentioned in paragraph 5(1)(a)(ii), and
TR is the rate at which, assuming the resident party has profits equal to A chargeable to the relevant tax for the tax period, those profits would be chargeable to that tax.
For this purpose, the rate at which those profits would be chargeable to that tax for that period is the highest rate at which that tax would be chargeable for that period if those profits were added to the resident party's total income.
(2)
For the purposes of paragraph 5(1)(b) and (4), the resulting increase in relevant taxes payable by the overseas party for the period corresponding to the tax period is any increase in the total amount of relevant taxes that would fall to be paid by that party (and not refunded) assuming that—
(a)
the overseas party's income for that period, in consequence of the material provision were an amount equal to A,
(b)
account were taken of any deduction or relief (other than any qualifying deduction or qualifying loss relief) taken into account by the overseas party in determining that party's actual liability to any relevant taxes in consequence of the material provision, and
(c)
all further reasonable steps were taken—
(i)
under the law of any part of the United Kingdom or any country or territory outside the United Kingdom, and
(ii)
under double taxation arrangements made in relation to any country or territory,
to minimise the amount of tax which would fall to be paid by the overseas party in the country or territory in question (other than steps to secure the benefit of any qualifying deduction or qualifying loss relief).
(3)
The steps mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)(c) include—
(a)
claiming, or otherwise securing the benefit of, reliefs, deductions, reductions or allowances, and
(b)
making elections for tax purposes.
(4)
For the purposes of this paragraph, any withholding tax which falls to be paid on payments made to the overseas party is (unless it is refunded) to be treated as tax which falls to be paid by that party (and not the person making the payment).
(5)
For the purposes of this paragraph, an amount of tax payable by the overseas party is refunded if and to the extent that—
(a)
any repayment of tax, or any payment in respect of a credit for tax, is made to any person, and
(b)
that repayment or payment is directly or indirectly in respect of the whole or part of the amount of tax payable by the overseas party,
but an amount refunded is to be ignored if and to the extent that it results from qualifying loss relief obtained by that party.
(6)
Where some or all of the overseas party's income is treated for the purposes of a relevant tax charged under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom as the income of a person or persons other than the overseas party, in paragraph 5 and this paragraph—
(a)
references to that party's liability to any tax (however expressed) include a reference to the liabilities of that person or those persons to the relevant tax,
(b)
references to any tax being payable by that party (however expressed) include a reference to the relevant tax being payable by that person or those persons, and
(c)
references to loss relief obtained by that party include a reference to loss relief obtained by that person or those persons,
and sub-paragraph (4) applies to that person or any of those persons as it applies to that party.
(7)
In this paragraph—
“qualifying deduction” means a deduction which—
(a)
is made in respect of actual expenditure of the overseas party,
(b)
does not arise directly from the arrangements,
(c)
is of a kind for which the resident party would have obtained a deduction in calculating that party's liability to any income tax or corporation tax had that party incurred the expenditure in respect of which the deduction is given, and
(d)
does not exceed the amount of the deduction that the resident party would have so obtained,
“qualifying loss relief” means any means by which a loss might be used for tax purposes to reduce the amount in respect of which the overseas party is liable to tax on the profits of a business, and
“relevant tax” has the same meaning as in paragraph 5.7
(1)
Adjustments must be made so as to counteract the tax advantages that would (ignoring this Schedule) arise from profit fragmentation arrangements.
(2)
The adjustments—
(a)
must relate to the expenses, income, profits or losses of the resident party for the tax period in which value is transferred as a result of the material provision,
(b)
must be based on what the value transferred would have been if it had resulted from a provision made or imposed as between independent parties acting at arm's length, and
(c)
must be just and reasonable.
(3)
References in this paragraph to “the resident party” are references to the resident party at the time at which the material provision is made or imposed.8
(1)
This paragraph applies where—
(a)
the resident party has paid a relevant tax by virtue of the application of paragraph 7,
(b)
at any time, the resident party or another person pays—
(i)
a further amount of the relevant tax, or
(ii)
an amount of non-UK tax corresponding to the relevant tax, and
(c)
the result is a double payment of tax calculated by reference to the same income or profits.
(2)
In order to avoid the double payment of tax, the resident party may make a claim in writing for one or more consequential adjustments to be made in respect of the tax paid mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a).
(3)
On a claim under this paragraph an officer of Revenue and Customs must make such of the consequential adjustments claimed (if any) as are just and reasonable.
(4)
The amount of any consequential adjustments must not exceed the lesser of—
(a)
the tax paid by the resident party as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(a), and
(b)
the tax paid as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b).
(5)
Consequential adjustments may be made—
(a)
in respect of any tax period,
(b)
by way of an assessment, the modification of an assessment, the amendment of a claim or otherwise, and
(c)
despite any time limit imposed by or under any enactment.9
In calculating income, profits or losses for any tax purposes, no account is to be taken of any amount which is paid (directly or indirectly) by a person for the purposes of meeting or reimbursing the cost of tax charged on the resident party by virtue of the application of paragraph 7.10
(1)
This paragraph applies where a person is a member of a partnership.
(2)
Any references in this Schedule to the expenses, income, profits or losses of, or to the adjustment of the expenses, income, profits or losses of, the person includes a reference to the person's share of the expenses, income, profits or losses of, or adjustment of the expenses, income, profits or losses of, the partnership.
(3)

For the purposes of this section a loss is referable to a time when a contract is not subject to corporation tax so far as, at the time to which the loss is referable, the company would not have been chargeable to corporation tax on any profits arising from the contract.
(4)
If the company was not a party to the contract at the time to which the loss is referable, subparagraph (3) applies as if the reference to the company were a reference to the person who at that time was in the same position as respects the contract as is subsequently held by the company.

another company acquired or created the asset during the period beginning with 8 July 2015 and ending with 31 March 2019,
(b)
it was a chargeable intangible asset in relation to that other company at any time during the period beginning with 29 October 2018 and ending with 31 March 2019, and
(c)
C acquired the asset on or after 1 April 2019 otherwise than in case A or case B from a person who was a related party in relation to C.
(2)
Case A is where—
(a)
C acquired the asset from a company that was within the charge to corporation tax at the time of the acquisition, and
(b)
the asset was not a pre-FA 2019 relevant asset in the hands of that company immediately before the acquisition.
(3)
Case B is where C acquired the asset from a person (“the intermediary”) who acquired the asset on or after 1 April 2019 from a third person—
(a)
who was not at the time of the intermediary's acquisition a related party in relation—
(i)
to the intermediary, or
(ii)
if the intermediary was not a company, to a company in relation to which the intermediary was a related party, and
(b)
who is not, at the time of the acquisition by C, a related party in relation to C.
(4)
References in this section to one person being (or not being) a related party in relation to another person are to be read as including references to the participation condition being met (or, as the case may be not being met) as between those persons.
(5)

C acquired the relevant asset on or after 1 April 2019 from a person (“the transferor”) who was a related party in relation to C at the time of the acquisition,
(c)
the value of the relevant asset derives in whole or in part from another asset (“the other asset”), and
(d)
the other asset meets the preserved status condition (see section 879G).
(2)
But if only part of the value of the relevant asset derives from the other asset—
(a)
the relevant asset is to be treated for the purposes of this Chapter as if it were two separate assets—
(i)
one representing the part of the value of the relevant asset that does so derive, and
(ii)
the other representing the part of the value of the relevant asset that does not so derive, and
(b)
subsection (1) applies only in relation to the separate asset representing the part of the value of the relevant asset that does so derive.
(3)
For the purposes of this section the cases in which the value of a relevant asset may be derived from another asset include any case where—
(a)
assets have been merged or divided,
(b)
assets have changed their nature, or

(2)
This subsection applies if the other asset—
(a)
was acquired or created by a company during the period beginning with 8 July 2015 and ending with 31 March 2019, and

was a chargeable intangible asset in the hands of that company at any time during the period beginning with 29 October 2018 and ending with 31 March 2019 when—
(i)
that company and C were related parties, or
(ii)
that company and the transferor were related parties.
(3)
This subsection applies if the other asset was a pre-FA 2019 relevant asset in the hands of a company at any time during the period beginning with 1 April 2019 and ending with the acquisition mentioned in section 879F(1)(b) when—
(a)
that company and C were related parties, or
(b)
that company and the transferor were related parties.
(4)
It does not matter for the purposes of section 879F(1)(a) who created the relevant asset.
(5)
Any apportionment necessary for the purposes of section 879F(2) must be made on a just and reasonable basis.
(6)
Section 879E(4) to (7) applies for the purposes of section 879F and this section.
(7)
Expressions used in this section have the same meaning as in section 879F.
879H
Pre-FA 2019 relevant asset: the fourth case
(1)
For the purposes of this Chapter a relevant asset of a company is a pre-FA 2019 relevant asset if—
(a)
the company acquired the asset on or after 1 April 2019 directly or indirectly in consequence of, or otherwise in connection with, a disposal of a relevant asset by another person, and
(b)
the asset disposed of would have been a pre-FA 2019 relevant asset in the hands of the company had the person transferred it to the company at the time of the disposal.

the acquired asset is acquired at the time of the disposal, or
(c)
the acquired asset is acquired by merging assets or otherwise.

where—
D is the amount of the debit that would be brought into account disregarding this section (and, accordingly, for the purposes of any calculation of the tax written-down value of the relevant asset needed to determine D, this section's effect in relation to any debits previously brought into account is to be disregarded), and

(3)
If, but for this section, a debit in respect of any of the relevant assets would be brought into account by the company for tax purposes under a provision of Chapter 4 (realisation of intangible fixed assets), the following two debits are to be brought into account under that provision instead—

RA is the relevant amount (see subsection (6)).
(5)
The amount of the non-trading debit is—
where—
D is the amount of the debit that would be brought into account under Chapter 4 disregarding this section (but, for the purposes of any calculation of the tax written-down value of the relevant asset needed to determine D, this section's effect in relation to any debits previously brought into account is not to be disregarded), and
TD is the amount of the debit determined in accordance with subsection (4).

a credit or debit (as the case may be) of an amount equal to the difference must be brought into account for the purposes of Part 5 of CTA 2009 for the 2019 period in the same way as a credit or debit which is brought into account in determining the company's profit or loss for that period in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice.

(2)
Any adjustment income or adjustment expense, or any receipt or expense, treated by any of the change of basis provisions as arising in consequence of a change of accounting policy that results in the right-of-use asset being first recognised for accounting purposes is to be treated as arising over a period (“the spreading period”) determined in accordance with the following steps—
Step 1 Find for each lease the amount by which the credits exceed the debits (or vice-versa). For this purpose, the credits and the debits are the amounts which, under generally accepted accounting practice—
(a)
are taken to equity as adjustments in the accounts of the lessee for the first period of account, and
(b)
are in consequence of the change of accounting policy that results in the right-of-use asset being first recognised for accounting purposes in those accounts.
Step 2 Calculate for each lease the percentage (“the relevant percentage”) that—
(a)
the amount found under Step 1 for the lease bears to
(b)
the total of all amounts found under Step 1 (treating such amounts as positive amounts).
Step 3 Find for each lease the period which results from applying the relevant percentage to the term of the lease that remains unexpired as at the date on which the first period of account begins. For this purpose, the term of a lease is to be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice as it applies for the first period of account.
Step 4 Calculate the sum of all periods found under Step 3.
Step 5 The spreading period is the period equal to the sum calculated under Step 4 beginning with the day on which the first period of account begins.
(3)
An amount to be treated as arising in any period falling wholly or partly in the spreading period is to be determined in proportion to the number of days of the period falling within the spreading period.
(4)
This paragraph is subject to paragraphs 15 and 16 (transfers of leases and cessation of activities).

(b)
the transferee is connected to the lessee,
(c)
immediately after the transfer, the transferee carries on activities the profits of which are chargeable to income tax or corporation tax, and
(d)

(2)
The amount is to continue to be dealt with in accordance with paragraph 13 but is to be treated as arising to the transferee over so much of the spreading period as falls on or after the date on which the transfer takes place.
(3)
If, following the transfer, it is necessary to apportion between more than one person an amount treated by paragraph 13 or this paragraph as arising, the apportionment is to be made on a just and reasonable basis.
(4)
In this paragraph—
“connected” is to be read in accordance with sections 993 and 994 of ITA 2007 and sections 1122 and 1123 of CTA 2010, and

before the whole of an amount has been treated by paragraph 13 as arising, the lessee permanently ceases to carry on activities the profits of which are chargeable to income tax or corporation tax, and

(2)

(a)
is to be treated as arising to the lessee, and
(b)
is to be brought into account in calculating the profits of the lessee,
immediately before the cessation.17

(2)
Paragraphs 12 to 14 and 16 apply to the portfolio (subject to any necessary modifications) in the same way as they apply to a lease.
(3)
If there is a transfer of the portfolio (or an individual lease within the portfolio), paragraph 15 applies to the transfer (subject to any necessary modifications) in the same way as it applies to the transfer of a lease.18

“(f)
paragraphs 12 to 17 of Schedule 14 to FA 2019 (transitional provision following the repeal of section 53 of FA 2011) so far as they have effect in relation to adjustments under Chapter 14 of Part 3 of CTA 2009 or sections 261 and 262 of that Act.”

the receipt or expense is treated as arising to the company in consequence of a change of accounting policy relating to a lease in respect of which the company is the lessee,
(c)

(d)
under the new accounting policy, the lease would fall to be treated as a right-of-use lease in those accounts but for—

the short term of the lease, or
(ii)
the low value of the leased asset.
(2)
For the purposes of Part 10 of TIOPA 2010 (corporate interest restriction)—
(a)
if the amount is brought into account as an expense, “tax-interest expense amount” (see section 382 of that Act) does not include that amount;
(b)
if the amount is brought into account as a receipt, “tax-interest income amount” (see section 385 of that Act) does not include that amount.
(3)
This paragraph has effect in relation to adjustments to which the financial statements of a worldwide group are treated by section 426 of TIOPA 2010 (changes in accounting policy) as subject in the same way as it has effect in relation to adjustments made under the change of accounting policy provisions by a company and accordingly—
(a)
if the amount is brought into account as an expense, “relevant expense amount” (see section 411(1) of that Act) does not include that amount;
(b)
if the amount is brought into account as a receipt, “relevant income amount” (see section 411(2) of that Act) does not include that amount.
(4)

“the change of accounting policy provisions” means Chapter 14 of Part 3 and sections 261 and 262 of CTA 2009 (adjustment on change of basis), and
“right-of-use lease” has the meaning given by section 494 of TIOPA 2010 (other interpretation).1
This Schedule applies if, on or after 1 November 2018, the OGA gives consent for a company (the “seller”) to sell an interest in a UK oil licence to another company (the “purchaser”).2
(1)
On or after the licence transfer date, the seller and purchaser may jointly make a TTH election in respect of an interest (“the TTH asset”) in a transferred oil field (the “TTH oil field”).
(2)
A “TTH election” is an election for—
(a)
an amount of the seller's ring fence profits (the “total TTH amount”) to be treated, in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule, as if it were an amount of the purchaser's profits (instead of the seller's profits), and
(b)
a corresponding amount of the seller's adjusted ring fence profits to be so treated for the purpose of Chapter 6 of Part 8 of CTA 2010 (supplementary charge).3
(1)
The total TTH amount may comprise—
(a)
an amount representing the seller's eligible ring fence profits for the reference accounting period, and
(b)
amounts representing the seller's eligible ring fence profits for so many of the preceding accounting periods ending on or after 17 April 2002 as the seller and purchaser may determine.
(2)

(b)
the total amount of the seller's eligible ring fence profits for the period—
(i)
beginning with 17 April 2002, and
(ii)
ending at the end of the reference accounting period.5

(b)
allocate the relevant proportion of the amount determined under paragraph (a) to the TTH asset (see paragraph 8),
(c)
adjust the allocated amount in accordance with paragraph 9, and
(d)
double the adjusted amount.6
(1)
The “net cost amount” is the appropriate DSA estimate of the decommissioning costs for the TTH oil field.
(2)
A “DSA estimate” is an estimate approved for the purposes of a qualifying decommissioning security agreement.
(3)
If there is only one qualifying decommissioning security agreement relating to the TTH oil field, the “appropriate DSA estimate” is the most recent DSA estimate approved for the purposes of that agreement within the relevant period.
(4)
If there is more than one qualifying decommissioning security agreement relating to the TTH oil field, the “appropriate DSA estimate” is the lowest of the DSA estimates approved for the purposes of any of those agreements within the relevant period.
(5)
For the purposes of sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), the “relevant period” is the period of 12 months ending with—
(a)
the date on which the TTH election is made, or
(b)
in a case where the hive down condition (see paragraph 56(5)) is met, the date on which the seller and the purchaser cease to be associated with one another.7
The “transferred proportion” of the net cost amount is the proportion of the decommissioning costs for the TTH oil field that, under the qualifying decommissioning security agreement for the purposes of which the appropriate DSA estimate is approved, is allocated to—
(a)
the seller, in the case of an agreement entered into before the sale of the interest in the UK oil licence concerned, or
(b)
the purchaser, in the case of an agreement entered into on or after that date.8
In paragraph 5(b), the “relevant proportion” means—
(a)
the proportion that the interest in the TTH oil field which is the TTH asset bears to—
(i)
the seller's other interests in the TTH oil field, if paragraph 7(a) applies, or
(ii)
the purchaser's other interests in the TTH oil field, if paragraph 7(b) applies, or
(b)
if the proportion cannot reasonably be determined in accordance with paragraph (a), such other proportion determined on a just and reasonable basis.9
(1)
To adjust the allocated amount for the purposes of paragraph 5(c)—
(a)
disregard the adjustments listed in sub-paragraph (2) made, for the purposes of calculating the net cost amount, in accordance with the terms of the decommissioning security agreement, and
(b)
if, in making that calculation in accordance with those terms, the relevant proportion of the estimate of the decommissioning costs is increased by an amount to take account of inflation, disregard the amount (if any) by which the increase exceeds the standard inflation adjustment amount.
(2)
The adjustments to be disregarded are—
(a)
any discount applied by reference to the period of time expected to elapse before the decommissioning costs are payable in relation to the TTH oil field, and
(b)
any adjustment made for the purposes of taking account of the risk that the decommissioning costs for the TTH oil field will exceed the estimate of those costs.
(3)
The “standard inflation adjustment amount” means the amount (if any) by which the relevant proportion of the estimate of the decommissioning costs for the TTH oil field would be increased if an adjustment for the purposes of taking account of inflation were made on the basis specified by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs for the purposes of this paragraph.10
(1)
A “decommissioning security agreement” is an agreement entered into for the purpose of—
(a)
determining the costs of decommissioning an oil field, and
(b)
providing security for—
(i)
the performance of obligations under an abandonment programme for the purposes of section 38A of the Petroleum Act 1998 (whether or not such a programme has been approved at the time the agreement is entered into), or
(ii)
the costs of decommissioning plant or machinery which is, or forms part of, a relevant onshore installation.
(2)
A decommissioning security agreement is “qualifying” for the purposes of this Schedule if—
(a)
the seller is a party to the agreement,
(b)
at least one of the parties is not associated with the seller, and
(c)
the estimate approved for the purposes of the agreement is a reasonable estimate of the decommissioning costs for the oil field.
(3)
In a case where the corporate restructuring condition (see paragraph 56(2)) is met, sub-paragraph (2)(a) has effect as if the reference to the seller were a reference to a party to the third party election (as defined in that paragraph).
(4)
In sub-paragraph (1)—
“abandonment programme” has the meaning given by section 29 of the Petroleum Act 1998, and
“relevant onshore installation” has the same meaning as in section 163 of CAA 2001 (see subsection (3C) of that section).
(5)
See paragraph 98 of this Schedule and section 271 of CTA 2010 for further provision about the meaning of “associated companies”.11
(1)
The total TTH amount may not include an amount representing the eligible ring fence profits for a particular accounting period (other than the reference accounting period) unless it also includes an amount representing the eligible ring fence profits for the next following qualifying accounting period.
(2)
An accounting period is “qualifying” for the purposes of this Schedule if the seller has eligible ring fence profits for that period.12
(1)
The transferred profits amount for an accounting period, other than the earliest period, must be an amount equal to the amount of the seller's eligible ring fence profits for the period.
(2)
The transferred profits amount for the earliest period must be an amount equal to the amount of the seller's eligible ring fence profits for that period, so far as that amount does not exceed the TTH balance for the earliest period.
(3)
The “TTH balance” for the earliest period is an amount equal to—
(a)
the total TTH amount, less
(b)
the transferred profits amounts for each later accounting period.
(4)
In this paragraph, “earliest period” means the earliest accounting period for which there is a transferred profits amount.13
Ring fence profits of an accounting period are “eligible” for the purposes of a TTH election if, as at the date the TTH election is made—
(a)
corporation tax is charged on the profits of that period at the main ring fence profits rate,
(b)
neither section 279B nor section 279C of CTA 2010 (marginal relief) applies in relation to the seller in that period,
(c)
the seller's liability to corporation tax in respect of the profits has been discharged in full, and
(d)
the total TTH amount for any other TTH election made by the seller (whether made with the purchaser or with another person) does not include an amount representing those profits.14
In determining, for the purposes of this Schedule, the amount of the seller's eligible ring fence profits for an accounting period that falls partly before 17 April 2002, the amount of the seller's eligible ring fence profits for that period is to be reduced by the proportion which the part of the accounting period falling before that date bears to the whole of the accounting period.15
This Part applies if—
(a)
the seller and the purchaser have jointly made a TTH election in respect of the TTH asset, and
(b)
the TTH election has been approved by an officer of Revenue and Customs (see paragraphs 61 and 62).16
(1)
Sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) apply if the seller makes a loss in a trade in an accounting period.
(2)
For the purposes of section 37(3)(b) of CTA 2010 (including for the purposes of that provision as it has effect under the other trade loss relief provisions), the seller's total profits of a pre-transfer accounting period are treated as being—
(a)
the seller's total profits for that period, less
(b)
the transferred profits amount for that period.
(3)
For the purposes of section 42 of CTA 2010, the seller's profits of a ring fence trade of a pre-transfer accounting period are treated as being—
(a)
the seller's ring fence profits for that period, less
(b)
the transferred profits amount for that period.17
The transferred profits amount for an accounting period is to be disregarded for the purposes of the application of any provision of the Corporation Tax Acts by reference to which the seller would (apart from this paragraph) be entitled to relief from, or a repayment of, corporation tax.18
(1)
Paragraphs 16 and 17 are subject to this paragraph.
(2)
If, on or after the licence transfer date, the seller's eligible ring fence profits for a pre-transfer accounting period are reduced to an amount which is lower than the transferred profits amount for that period—
(a)
the seller is treated as incurring a loss in a ring fence trade, of an amount equal to the difference, for the accounting period, and
(b)
paragraph 17 does not apply to the difference.19
Paragraphs 20 and 21 apply in relation to an accounting period for which there is a transferred profits amount.20
(1)
The transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for the accounting period is to be disregarded for the purposes of any provision of the Corporation Tax Acts by reference to which the seller would (apart from this paragraph) be entitled to a repayment of supplementary charge.
(2)
The “transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount” is—
(a)
in the case of an accounting period other than the earliest period, the amount of the seller's eligible adjusted ring fence profits for the period;
(b)
in the case of the earliest period, an amount equal to the transferred proportion of the seller's eligible adjusted ring fence profits for the period.21
(1)
For the purposes of the application of any provision of Part 4 or Part 8 of CTA 2010 in relation to the seller—
(a)
the amount of each ARFP component, or (in the case of the earliest period) an amount equal to the transferred proportion of each ARFP component, for the accounting period is to be disregarded, and
(b)
in the case of the earliest period, references in those provisions to an ARFP component for the accounting period are to be treated as references to the retained proportion of that ARFP component for the period.
(2)
“ARFP component”, in relation to an accounting period, means—
(a)
the financing costs for the period that are left out of account for the purposes of the assumption mentioned in section 330(3) of CTA 2010, and
(b)
the amount of any reduction of the seller's adjusted ring fence profits by reference to the cumulative total amount of activated allowance for the period under any of the following provisions of CTA 2010—
(i)
section 332E (investment allowance),
(ii)
section 356D (onshore allowance), and
(iii)
section 356JG (cluster area allowance).
(3)
See paragraph 17 for provision about disregarding the transferred profits amount for an accounting period.
(4)
Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply in relation to the application of any provision for the purposes of determining the seller's eligible adjusted ring fence profits for an accounting period for the purposes of this Schedule.22
(1)
For the purposes of paragraphs 20(2) and 21(1)—
(a)
“earliest period” has the meaning given by paragraph 12(4),
(b)
the “transferred proportion” is the same as the proportion that the transferred profits amount for the accounting period bears to the seller's ring fence profits amount for the period, and
(c)
the “retained proportion” is the same as the proportion that the retained profits amount for the accounting period bears to the seller's ring fence profits amount for the period.
(2)
In sub-paragraph (1)(c), “retained profits amount” means the amount of the difference between the amount of the seller's ring fence profits for the earliest period and the transferred profits amount for that period.
(3)
For the purposes of this Schedule, adjusted ring fence profits of an accounting period are “eligible” if—
(a)
an amount is charged on the profits under section 330(1) of CTA 2010 (supplementary charge in respect of ring fence trades), and
(b)
as at the TTH election is made, the seller's liability to tax under that section in respect of the adjusted ring fence profits has been discharged in full.23
This Part applies if—
(a)
the seller and the purchaser have jointly made a TTH election in respect of the TTH asset,
(b)
the TTH election has been approved by an officer of Revenue and Customs (see paragraphs 61 and 62),
(c)
the winning of oil from the TTH oil field has permanently ceased, and
(d)
in a post-acquisition accounting period (the “loss period”)—
(i)
the purchaser makes a loss in a ring fence trade,
(ii)
the loss is a decommissioning loss, and
(iii)
the purchaser holds, for the loss period, an activated TTH amount (see Parts 5 and 6).24
In paragraph 23(d)(ii), “decommissioning loss” means a loss in respect of which—
(a)
a claim for relief under section 37 of CTA 2010 is made by the purchaser by virtue of section 39 or 40 of that Act (relief for trade losses: terminal losses and ring fence trades), or
(b)
relief is given under section 42 of CTA 2010 (ring fence trades: further extension of period for relief).25
(1)
The total activated TTH amount held by the purchaser for the loss period is to be applied in accordance with sub-paragraph (2)(b) or (3)(b).
(2)
The purchaser's total profits of a pre-acquisition accounting period are to be treated, for the purposes of section 37(3)(b) of CTA 2010 (including for the purposes of that provision as it has effect under the other trade loss relief provisions) as being the total of—
(a)
the amount of the purchaser's total profits for that period, and
(b)
if and so far as the loss in respect of which relief is claimed exceeds the amount mentioned in paragraph (a), the activated transferred profits amount for that period.
(3)
The purchaser's profits of a ring fence trade of a pre-acquisition accounting period are to be treated for the purposes of section 42 of CTA 2010, as being the total of—
(a)
the purchaser's profits of a ring fence trade for that period, and
(b)
if and so far as the loss in respect of which relief is claimed exceeds the amount mentioned in paragraph (a), the activated transferred profits amount for that period.
(4)
The “activated transferred profits amount” for a pre-acquisition accounting period means the amount allocated to the period under paragraph 44 for the purposes of the application of this paragraph in relation to the loss period.
(5)
See paragraphs 38 to 42 for provision about the “total activated TTH amount”.26
(1)
This paragraph applies where, in respect of a loss period, an activated transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period is to be applied in accordance with paragraph 25(2)(b) or (3)(b).
(2)
A repayment of tax to be determined as if—
(a)
an amount had been charged under section 330(1) of CTA 2010 in respect of the activated ARFP amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period,
(b)
that amount had been charged on, and paid by, the purchaser (instead of the seller), and
(c)
the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period were recalculated in accordance with paragraph 50.
(3)
See paragraph 53 for provision about the “activated ARFP amount”.27
(1)
In this Schedule, references to the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser are references to—
(a)
the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount (see paragraph 20(2)) for the accounting period of the seller which coincides with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser, or
(b)
if there is no coinciding accounting period of the seller, the overlapping proportion of the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for each accounting period of the seller that overlaps with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser.
(2)
The overlapping proportion, in relation to an accounting period of the seller, is the same as the proportion that the part of the seller's accounting period that overlaps with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser bears to the whole of the seller's accounting period.28
For the purposes of section 59D(2) of TMA 1970 (repayment of excess corporation tax), the following amounts paid by the seller are treated as having been paid by the purchaser—
(a)
the amount of corporation tax in respect of an activated transferred profits amount, for a pre-acquisition accounting period, that is applied in accordance with 25(2)(b) or (3)(b), and
(b)
the amount of supplementary charge in respect of the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for that accounting period.29
(1)
An enquiry under Part 4 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998 into a tax return for the accounting period in which the claim under section 37 of CTA 2010 in respect of a decommissioning loss in a loss period is made (see paragraphs 23 and 24), or an enquiry into the claim under Schedule 1A to TMA 1970, extends to—
(a)
the decommissioning expenditure amount attributable to the TTH oil field for any accounting period,
(b)
the tracked profit or loss amount attributable to the TTH asset for any accounting period, and
(c)
whether a TTH activation event has occurred in relation to the TTH asset.
(2)
See Part 5 for provision about “the decommissioning expenditure amount” and a TTH activation event, and paragraphs 64 and 65 for provision about the “tracked profit and loss amount”.30
(1)
A TTH activation event occurs in relation to the TTH asset if—
(a)
the winning of oil from the TTH oil field has permanently ceased, and
(b)
at the end of a post-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser, the total decommissioning expenditure amount exceeds the total net profits amount.
(2)
The “total decommissioning expenditure amount” is the relevant proportion of the total of the decommissioning expenditure amounts (see paragraph 31) attributable to the TTH oil field, in respect of which an allowance or allocation is made to the purchaser, for—
(a)
the period mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b), and
(b)
each preceding accounting period which is a post-acquisition accounting period.
(3)
The “total net profits amount” is the aggregate of the tracked profit or loss amounts (see paragraphs 64 and 65) attributable to the TTH asset for—
(a)
the period mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b), and
(b)
each preceding accounting period which is a post-acquisition accounting period.
(4)
But if the aggregate of the tracked profit or loss amounts attributable to the TTH asset for the periods mentioned in sub-paragraph (3)(a) and (b) is a negative amount, the total net profits amount is nil.
(5)
In this paragraph, “the relevant proportion” means the proportion that the interest in the TTH oil field which is the TTH asset bears to the purchaser's other interests in the TTH oil field or, if the proportion cannot reasonably be determined on that basis, such other proportion determined on a just and reasonable basis.31
The “decommissioning expenditure amount” attributable to the TTH oil field for an accounting period, is the total of each of the following amounts attributable to the field for the post-acquisition accounting period—
(a)
the special allowance amount,
(b)
the post-cessation expenditure amount, and
(c)
the restoration expenditure amount.32
(1)
The “special allowance amount” for an accounting period is the amount of a special allowance made under section 164 of CAA 2001 (general decommissioning expenditure incurred before cessation of ring fence trade) for that period.
(2)
A special allowance amount is attributable to the TTH oil field so far as the expenditure in respect of which the allowance is made is expenditure incurred on decommissioning plant or machinery brought into use for the purposes of oil-related activities carried on wholly or partly in direct connection with the field.33
(1)
The “post-cessation expenditure amount” for an accounting period is the amount that, under section 165(3)(a) of CAA 2001 (general decommissioning expenditure after ceasing ring fence trade), is allocated to the appropriate pool for that period.
(2)
A post-cessation expenditure amount is attributable to the TTH oil field so far as the general decommissioning expenditure in respect of which the amount is allocated is expenditure incurred on decommissioning plant or machinery brought into use for the purposes of oil-related activities carried on wholly or partly in direct connection with the field.34
(1)
The “restoration expenditure amount” for an accounting period is the amount that is treated as qualifying expenditure under section 416ZA of CAA 2001 (ring fence trades: expenditure on site restoration) for that period.
(2)
A restoration expenditure amount is attributable to the TTH oil field if the qualifying expenditure is incurred in relation to the field.35
For the purposes of paragraphs 32(2), 33(2) and 34(2), expenditure for an accounting period is to be apportioned between the TTH oil field and other oil fields (or parts of oil fields) on a just and reasonable basis.36
This Part of this Schedule applies if a TTH activation event occurs in relation to the TTH asset.37
In this Schedule—
(a)
“first activation period” means the first post-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser in which a TTH activation event occurs, and
(b)
“post-activation period” means a subsequent accounting period of the purchaser.38
The “total activated TTH amount” held by the purchaser for a loss period which is the first activation period is the lower of—
(a)
the amount by which, at the end of that period, the total decommissioning expenditure amount exceeds the total net profits amount (see paragraph 30), and
(b)
the total TTH amount.39
The “total activated TTH amount” held by the purchaser for a loss period which is a post-activation period is the lower of—
(a)
the adjusted activated TTH amount (see paragraphs 40 to 42), and
(b)
the closing balance of the total TTH amount for the immediately preceding accounting period (see paragraph 49).40
(1)
This paragraph applies if, in relation to a post-activation period—
(a)
the relevant proportion of the decommissioning expenditure amount attributable to the TTH oil field for that period, exceeds
(b)
the tracked profit or loss amount attributable to the TTH asset for that period.
(2)
The “additional activated TTH amount” for the post-activation period is an amount equal to the excess.
(3)
For the purposes of paragraph 39, the adjusted activated TTH amount is the total of—
(a)
the closing balance of activated TTH for the immediately preceding accounting period, and
(b)
the additional activated TTH amount for the post-activation period.
(4)
In this paragraph and in paragraph 41, “relevant proportion” has the same meaning as in paragraph 30(5).41
(1)
This paragraph applies if, in relation to a post-activation period—
(a)
the tracked profit or loss amount attributable to the TTH asset for that period, exceeds
(b)
the relevant proportion of the decommissioning expenditure amount attributable to the TTH oil field for that period.
(2)
The “TTH reduction amount” for the post-activation period is an amount equal to the excess.
(3)
If the TTH reduction amount is less than the closing balance amount, the adjusted activated TTH amount for the purposes of paragraph 39 is an amount equal to the difference.
(4)
If the TTH reduction amount is equal to, or greater than, the closing balance amount, the adjusted activated TTH amount for the purposes of paragraph 39 is nil.
(5)
In this paragraph, references to the “closing balance amount” are references to the closing balance of activated TTH for the accounting period immediately preceding the post-activation period.42
If neither paragraph 40 nor paragraph 41 applies in relation to a post-activation period, the “adjusted activated TTH amount” for the purposes of paragraph 39 is—
(a)
an amount equal to the closing balance of activated TTH for the immediately preceding accounting period, if it is greater than nil, or
(b)
nil, if the closing balance of activated TTH for the immediately preceding accounting period is nil or a negative amount.43
Paragraph 44 applies for the purposes of paragraph 25 (effect of trade loss relief provisions in relation to the purchaser).44
The total activated TTH amount for a loss period is to be allocated, for the purposes of the application of paragraph 25 in relation to that loss period, to pre-acquisition accounting periods of the purchaser as follows—
Step 1 Take the most recent pre-acquisition accounting period for which there is an unused transferred profits amount which is greater than nil.
Step 2 Allocate to that pre-acquisition accounting period an amount equal to the lower of—
(a)
the unused transferred profits amount, and
(b)
the total activated TTH amount held by the purchaser for the loss period.
Step 3 Allocate to the next most recent pre-acquisition accounting period an amount equal to the lower of—
(a)
the transferred profits amount for that period, and
(b)
the available activated TTH amount for the loss period.
Step 4 Repeat Step 3 (taking later pre-acquisition accounting periods before earlier ones) until the amount given by paragraph (a) or (b) is nil.45
(1)
In this Schedule, references to the transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser are references to—
(a)
the transferred profits amount for the accounting period of the seller which coincides with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser, or
(b)
if there is no coinciding accounting period of the seller, the overlapping proportion of the transferred profits amount for each accounting period of the seller that overlaps with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser.
(2)
The overlapping proportion, in relation to an accounting period of the seller, is the same as the proportion that the part of the seller's accounting period that overlaps with the pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser bears to the whole of the seller's accounting period.46
(1)
This paragraph applies for the purposes of Steps 1 and 2 of paragraph 44.
(2)
If the loss period is the first activation period, the reference to the “unused transferred profits amount” for a pre-acquisition accounting period is a reference to the transferred profits amount for that period.
(3)
If the loss period is a post-activation period, the reference to the “unused transferred profits amount” for a pre-acquisition accounting period is a reference to the amount equal to—
(a)
the transferred profits amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period, less
(b)
the total of the amounts applied for the pre-acquisition accounting period in accordance with paragraph 25, for the purposes of the application of that paragraph in relation to the first activation period or an earlier post-activation period.47
(1)
This paragraph applies for the purposes of allocating an amount to a pre-acquisition accounting period under Step 3 of paragraph 44.
(2)
The “available activated TTH amount” held by the purchaser for the loss period, is an amount equal to—
(a)
the total activated TTH amount for the period, less
(b)
the total of the activated transferred profits amounts allocated under paragraph 44 to later pre-acquisition accounting periods.
(3)
In sub-paragraph (2)(b) the reference to “later pre-acquisition accounting periods” is a reference to pre-acquisition accounting periods that begin after the period mentioned in sub-paragraph (1).48
(1)
The closing balance of activated TTH for the first activation period, or a post-activation period in relation to which paragraph 40, 41(3) or 42 applies, the closing balance of activated TTH for the period is—
(a)
the total activated TTH amount held by the purchaser for that period, less
(b)
the amount applied in accordance with paragraph 25 for that period.
(2)
If paragraph 41(4) applies in relation to a post-activation period, the closing balance of activated TTH for the period is the negative amount determined by deducting—
(a)
the TTH reduction amount for that period, from
(b)
the closing balance of activated TTH for the immediately preceding accounting period.49
The closing balance of the total TTH amount for an accounting period is—
(a)
the total TTH amount, less
(b)
the total of the amounts (if any) applied in accordance with paragraph 25 for that accounting period and earlier accounting periods.50
(1)
This paragraph applies for the purposes of recalculating the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period mentioned in paragraph 26(1) (for the purposes of paragraph 26(2)(c)).
(2)
The recalculated transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for the period is the aggregate of—
(a)
the reduced ARFP amount for the pre-acquisition period (see paragraphs 51 and 52), and
(b)
the adjusted finance cost amount for the loss period mentioned in paragraph 26(1) (see paragraph 55).
(3)
But if the amount given by taking the steps in sub-paragraph (2) is a negative amount, the recalculated transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount is nil.51
(1)
To determine the “reduced ARFP amount” for a pre-acquisition accounting period—
(a)
take the activated ARFP amount for the period, and
(b)
reduce that amount by the amount applied, in relation to the loss period mentioned in paragraph 26(1), in accordance with paragraph 25(2)(b) or (3)(b) for the pre-acquisition accounting period.
(2)
This paragraph is subject to paragraph 52.52
(1)
This paragraph (instead of paragraph 51) applies if the percentage specified in section 330(1) of CTA 2010 for the pre-acquisition accounting period mentioned in paragraph 26(1) is greater than 20%.
(2)
To determine the “reduced ARFP amount” for the pre-acquisition accounting period—
(a)
calculate the total of—
(i)
the activated ARFP amount for the period, and
(ii)
the ARFP uplift amount for the period (see paragraph 54),
(b)
reduce the amount given by paragraph (a) by the amount applied, in relation to the loss period mentioned in paragraph 26(1), in accordance with paragraph 25(2)(b) or (3)(b) for the pre-acquisition accounting period.53

The “activated ARFP amount” for a pre-acquisition accounting period is the amount equal to—
where—
A is the amount applied, in relation to the loss period, in accordance with paragraph 25(2)(b) or (3)(b) for the pre-acquisition accounting period,
T is the unused transferred profits amount for that period, and
(2)
In sub-paragraph (1), “unused transferred profits amount” has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of Steps 1 and 2 of paragraph 44 (see paragraph 46).
(3)
Sub-paragraph (4) applies if, in respect of an earlier loss period—
(a)
an activated transferred profits amount for the pre-acquisition accounting period mentioned in paragraph 26(1) is applied in accordance with paragraph 25(2)(b) or (3)(b), and
(b)
a corresponding repayment is determined under paragraph 26(2) (an “earlier repayment”).
(4)
The amount of the transferred adjusted ring fence profits for the pre-acquisition accounting period is treated, for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1), as being reduced by an amount equal to the total of the activated ARFP amounts for that period for the purposes of each earlier repayment.54
The “ARFP uplift amount” for a pre-acquisition accounting period is the amount equal to—
where—
SC is the percentage specified in section 330(1) of CTA 2010 for the pre-acquisition accounting period, and

the corporate restructuring condition or the hive down condition is met in relation to that election.
(2)
Paragraph 5(2)(a) of Schedule 1A to TMA 1970 (power to enquire into claims: time limits) has effect in relation to the election as if the reference in that provision to the day on which the claim was made were a reference to—
(a)
in a case where the corporate restructuring condition is met by reference to paragraph 56(2)(b)(i), the day on which the third party election was made;
(b)
in a case where the corporate restructuring condition is met by reference to paragraph 56(2)(b)(ii), the day on which the seller and purchaser cease to be associated with one another;
(c)
in a case where the hive down condition is met, the day on which the seller and the purchaser ceased to be associated with one another.61
An officer of Revenue and Customs may approve the TTH election by giving notice in writing (an “approval notice”) to the seller and the purchaser.62
(1)
If no approval notice or enquiry notice is given, in respect of the TTH election, before the end of the period mentioned in paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 1A to TMA 1970 (time limit for opening an enquiry), the election is deemed to have been approved by an officer of Revenue and Customs at the end of that period.
(2)
In sub-paragraph (1), the reference to an “enquiry notice” is a reference to a notice under paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 1A to TMA 1970 (intention to enquire into a claim or election).63
The purchaser is required, as a condition of the approval of the election—
(a)
to comply with the profit tracking requirements in relation to—
(i)
the accounting period in which the interest in a UK oil licence, referred to in paragraph 1, is acquired by the purchaser, and
(ii)
each subsequent accounting period; and
(b)
to keep and preserve records, in accordance with such requirements as may be specified by an officer of Revenue and Customs, for the purposes of giving effect to this Schedule.64
(1)
The purchaser complies with the profit tracking requirements in relation to an accounting period if the purchaser's company tax return for the period is accompanied by a statement of the tracked profit or loss amount for the period.
(2)
The “tracked profit or loss amount” for an accounting period is the amount of profit or loss that is attributable to the TTH asset, excluding the relevant proportion of the decommissioning expenditure amount attributable to the TTH oil field, for that period.
(3)
In sub-paragraph 64(2), “relevant proportion” has the same meaning as in paragraph 30 (see paragraph 30(5)).65
(1)
For the purposes of determining the tracked profit or loss amount for an accounting period—
(a)
just and reasonable apportionments are to be made of the receipts, expenses, assets and liabilities of—
(i)
the purchaser, and
(ii)
any other company that is associated with the purchaser and has an interest in the TTH asset (including an interest in a share in the oil won and saved in the TTH oil field), and
(b)
for the purposes of paragraph (a), an officer of Revenue and Customs may require that financing costs for an accounting period are to be apportioned on such basis as the officer may reasonably specify before the beginning of that period.
(2)
In this paragraph “financing costs” has the meaning it has for the purposes of section 330 of CTA 2010 (see section 331 of that Act).66
(1)
The purchaser's senior tracking officer must—
(a)
take reasonable steps to ensure that the tracked profit and loss amount attributable to a TTH asset for each tracking period is determined in accordance with paragraph 65, and
(b)
provide the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs with a certificate as to compliance with paragraph (a).
(2)
For each tracking period, the purchaser must notify the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs of the name of each person who was its senior tracking officer at any time during the period.

(a)
in the form and manner specified by an officer of Revenue and Customs, and
(b)
on or before the filing date for the purchaser's tax return for the tracking period (see paragraph 14 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998).
(4)
In this Part, “tracking period”, in relation to the TTH asset, means each accounting period in relation to which the purchaser is required under paragraph 63(a) to comply with the profit tracking requirements.67
(1)
The purchaser's “senior tracking officer” is the officer of the purchaser or of an associated company who, in the purchaser's reasonable opinion, has overall responsibility for the purchaser's financial accounting arrangements.
(2)
In this section, “officer”, in relation to a company, means—
(a)
a director,
(b)
a manager,
(c)
a secretary, and
(d)
any other person managing or purporting to manage any of the company's affairs.68
(1)
The senior tracking officer is liable to a penalty of £5,000 if the officer, without reasonable excuse—
(a)
fails to comply with paragraph 66(1)(a) at any time in a tracking period, or
(b)
fails to provide a certificate in accordance with paragraph 66(1)(b) and (3).
(2)
The senior tracking officer is not liable to more than one penalty under paragraph 68(1)(a) in respect of the TTH asset and the same tracking period.
(3)
If the purchaser, without reasonable excuse, fails to give a notice in accordance with paragraph 66(2) and (3), the purchaser is liable to a penalty of £5,000.
(4)
If (but for this sub-paragraph) more than one person would be liable for a penalty under sub-paragraph 68(1)(a) or (b) in respect of the TTH asset and a tracking period, only the person who became the senior tracking officer latest in the tracking period is liable to such a penalty.69
(1)
Where a senior tracking officer, or the purchaser, becomes liable for a penalty under paragraph 68—
(a)
Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs may assess the penalty, and
(b)
if they do so, they must notify the person liable for the penalty.
(2)
An assessment of a penalty under this Part for a failure in respect of a tracking period may not be made—
(a)
more than 6 months after the failure first comes to the attention of an officer of Revenue and Customs, or
(b)
more than 6 years after the filing date for the purchaser's tax return for the tracking period (see paragraph 14 of Schedule 18 to FA 1998).
(3)
See paragraph 94 for provision about appeals against a penalty under paragraph 68.70
(1)
A penalty under paragraph 68 must be paid—
(a)
before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the date on which the notification under paragraph 69 was issued, or
(b)
if a notice of appeal against the penalty is given, before the end of the period of 30 days beginning with the date on which the appeal is determined or withdrawn.
(2)
A penalty under this Schedule may be enforced as if it were income tax charged in an assessment and due and payable or, in the case of the purchaser, corporation tax charged in an assessment and due and payable.71
(1)
A TTH election in respect of a TTH asset—
(a)
has effect, if it is approved in accordance with paragraph 61 or 62, from the licence transfer date,
(b)
continues to have effect indefinitely in relation to seller, and
(c)
continues to have effect in relation to the purchaser unless it is withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of this Schedule.
(2)
References in this Schedule to the “effective date of a TTH election” are to be construed in accordance with sub-paragraph (1)(a).72
(1)
A TTH election ceases to have effect in relation to the purchaser if—
(a)
the purchaser, without reasonable excuse, persistently fails to comply with either of the conditions mentioned in paragraph 63, and
(b)
an officer of Revenue and Customs gives notice to the purchaser of the withdrawal of the election.
(2)
If notice is given under sub-paragraph (1), the TTH election ceases to have effect in relation to the purchaser for the accounting period in which the notice is given and each subsequent accounting period.
(3)
A notice given under sub-paragraph (1) does not affect any relief given by reference to paragraph 25 or 26 for a loss period ending before the notice is given.
(4)
See paragraph 94 for provision about appeals against a decision to withdraw an election under this paragraph.73
If a document provided for the purposes of making a TTH election contains an inaccuracy which is, or results in, an overstatement of the total TTH amount, Schedule 24 to FA 2007 has effect as if—
(a)
the seller (and not the purchaser) is treated as giving the document to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs,
(b)
the inaccuracy is treated (so far as would not otherwise be the case) as leading to a false or inflated claim to repayment of tax, and
(c)
“the potential lost revenue” in respect of the inaccuracy is an amount equal to 10% of the amount by which the total TTH amount is overstated.74
(1)
This paragraph applies if an officer of Revenue and Customs discovers that a TTH election incorrectly states an amount that affects, or may affect—
(a)
the amount which may be applied in accordance with paragraph 25 (effect of trade loss relief provisions), or
(b)
the amount of a repayment determined by reference to paragraph 26 (supplementary charge: repayment of tax).
(2)
The officer—
(a)
may amend the TTH election to correct that amount, subject to paragraph 75, and
(b)
must give notice to the purchaser of an amendment under paragraph (a).
(3)
But the power to amend the TTH election under this paragraph may only be exercised if, at the time the election was approved (see paragraphs 61 and 62), an officer of Revenue and Customs could not have been reasonably expected, on the basis of the information made available to the officer before that time, to be aware that the amount stated was incorrect.
(4)
An amendment under this paragraph may not be made more than 12 months after information that, in the opinion of an officer of Revenue and Customs, justifies the correction of the TTH election, comes to the officer's attention.
(5)
An amendment under this paragraph is to be ignored for the purposes of the application of Part 3 of this Schedule (effect of a TTH election on the seller).
(6)
If, on or after the licence transfer date, the seller's total profits for a pre-transfer accounting period are reduced, the statement of the total profits (or a statement of an amount determined by reference to the total profits) is not to be regarded as incorrect for the purposes of this paragraph (but see paragraph 18).
(7)
See paragraph 94 for provision about appeals against a decision under this paragraph.75
(1)
This paragraph applies if, before the correction under paragraph 74 is made, an activated transferred profits amount for a pre-acquisition accounting period has been applied in accordance with paragraph 25(2)(b) or (3)(b).
(2)
An amendment made under paragraph 74(2) may not—
(a)
reduce the transferred profits amount for that pre-acquisition accounting period to an amount which is less than the amount that has been applied, in respect of loss periods ending before the determination is made, in accordance with paragraph 25 for the pre-acquisition accounting period, or
(b)
reduce the total TTH amount to an amount which is less than the total of the amounts that have been applied in accordance with paragraph 25 in respect of loss periods ending before the determination is made.76
Where the seller and the purchaser jointly make a TTH election in respect of the TTH asset, the transfer of tax history is not to be treated as—
(a)
the disposal or acquisition of an asset for the purposes of TCGA 1992, or
(b)
the disposal or acquisition of an intangible fixed asset for the purposes of Part 8 of CTA 2009.77
The amount or value of any consideration for the transfer of tax history is to be treated as part of the consideration for the licence interest for the purposes of—
(a)
computing the chargeable gain or allowable loss accruing on the disposal (or on any subsequent disposal) of the licence interest (see section 8 of TCGA 1992), and
(b)
computing the disposal value of the licence interest, on its disposal, for the purposes of Part 5 of CAA 2001 (mineral extraction allowances).78
Any value attributable to the transfer of tax history is to be taken into account in determining the market value of the licence interest for the purposes of—
(a)
section 17 of TCGA 1992 (disposals and acquisitions treated as being made at market value);
(b)
Part 5 of CAA 2001, if the disposal value of the licence interest for the purposes of that Part is the market value of the licence interest at the time of that disposal (see section 423 of CAA 2001).79
For the purposes of the application of sections 195A to 196 of TCGA 1992 (oil licence swaps) in relation to the disposal of the licence interest by the seller to the purchaser, references in those sections to the disposal are treated as including references to the transfer of tax history.80
(1)
References in this Part to “the transfer of tax history” are references to—
(a)
the seller, in consequence of the TTH election, ceasing to be entitled to take the transferred profits for an accounting period into account for certain corporation tax purposes in the circumstances specified in Part 3 of this Schedule, and
(b)
the purchaser, in consequence of the TTH election, acquiring an entitlement, in the circumstances specified in Part 4 of this Schedule, to apply an amount of the transferred profits for the purposes of the trade loss relief provisions and to a corresponding repayment of supplementary charge.
(2)
References in this Part to “the licence interest” are references to the interest in a UK oil licence referred to in paragraph 1.81
This Part applies if—
(a)
the purchaser (referred to in this Part as “the first purchaser”) and the seller jointly make a TTH election (the “first TTH election”) in respect of an interest (the “first TTH asset”) in the TTH oil field,
(b)
the first purchaser subsequently sells to another company (“the second purchaser”) an interest in a UK oil licence which applies to the area which includes the TTH oil field, and
(c)
the first purchaser and the second purchaser jointly make a TTH election (the “subsequent TTH election”) in respect of an interest (the “subsequent TTH asset”) in the TTH oil field.82
(1)
Sub-paragraph (2) applies if—
(a)
the first purchaser has an interest in the UK oil licence referred to in paragraph 1, in addition to the interest in that licence acquired from the seller, and
(b)
the UK oil licence referred to in paragraph 81(b) is the same UK oil licence referred to in paragraph 1.
(2)
Interests in the licence acquired later by the first purchaser are treated, for the purposes of this Part, as being transferred to the second purchaser before interests in the licence acquired earlier by the first purchaser.83
(1)
This Schedule applies, for the purposes of the subsequent TTH election, as if the original TTH amount for all relevant accounting periods were an amount of the first purchaser's eligible ring fence profits for that period.
(2)
Sub-paragraph (1) is subject to paragraphs 85 to 88.
(3)
In this Part of this Schedule, “relevant accounting period” means a pre-acquisition accounting period of the first purchaser for which there is, immediately before the effective date of the subsequent TTH election, an unused transferred profits amount.
(4)
In this Part of this Schedule, references to the “original TTH amount” mean, in relation to a relevant accounting period—
(a)
the unused transferred profits amount for that period, or
(b)
if the first TTH asset is not the same as the subsequent TTH asset, the relevant proportion of that amount for that period.
(5)
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (4)(b), the “relevant proportion” is the proportion that the subsequent TTH asset bears to the first TTH asset or, if the proportion cannot reasonably be determined on that basis, such other proportion determined on a just and reasonable basis.
(6)
In this paragraph, references to the unused transferred profits amount for an accounting period are references to—
(a)
the transferred profits amount, in relation to the first TTH election, for that period, less
(b)
the total of the amounts applied for that period in accordance with paragraph 25, for the purposes of the application of that paragraph in relation to a loss period of the first purchaser.84
The original TTH amount for each relevant accounting period ceases to be treated, for the purposes of the first TTH election, as a transferred profits amount for that period in relation to the first purchaser.85
(1)
Paragraphs 86 and 87 apply in relation to the subsequent TTH election, subject to sub-paragraph (2).
(2)
The first purchaser and the second purchaser may elect, at the time the TTH election is made, that neither paragraph 86 nor paragraph 87 applies in relation to the subsequent TTH election.86
(1)
The total TTH amount may not include an amount representing the first purchaser's eligible ring fence profits for an accounting period unless it also includes an amount representing, in respect of each relevant accounting period, the original TTH amount for that period.
(2)
Paragraph 11 (consecutive accounting periods) does not apply in relation to an amount representing an original TTH amount for a relevant accounting period (but see sub-paragraph (3)).
(3)
The total TTH amount may not include an amount representing the original TTH amount for a particular accounting period unless it also includes an amount representing the original TTH amount for the next following relevant accounting period.
(4)
If the original TTH amount exceeds the total TTH amount, the transferred profits amount for the earliest relevant accounting period must be an amount equal to—
(a)
the total TTH amount, less
(b)
the transferred profits amount for later relevant accounting periods.
(5)
For the purposes of paragraph 12 (the transferred profits amount)—
(a)
references to the “earliest period” are to be treated as references to the earliest accounting period for which there is a transferred profits amount by reason of the first purchaser's eligible ring fence profits for that period (and not by reason of an original TTH amount for that period), and
(b)
the reference in sub-paragraph (2) to the TTH balance for the earliest period is to be treated as a reference to the TTH balance less the transferred profits amounts for each relevant accounting period.87
In the application of this Schedule for the purposes of the subsequent TTH election—
(a)
in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 30 (TTH activation event), the reference to an allowance or allocation made to the purchaser includes a reference to the relevant proportion (within the meaning of paragraph 83(5)) of an allowance or allocation made to the first purchaser;
(b)
in paragraph 30(2)(b) and (3)(b), and in paragraph 31 (decommissioning expenditure amount), references to a post-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser include references to a post-acquisition accounting period of the first purchaser;
(c)
in paragraph 30(3) as it applies in relation to post-acquisition accounting periods of the first purchaser, the reference to amounts attributable to the TTH asset is to be treated as a reference to the relevant proportion (within the meaning of paragraph 83(5)) of those amounts;

references in this Schedule to a pre-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser include references to a pre-acquisition accounting period of the first purchaser;
(f)
references in paragraphs 83 to 86 and 89 to an amount of the first purchaser's eligible ring fence profits do not includes references to an original TTH amount.88
(1)
This paragraph applies if—
(a)
the first purchaser and the second purchaser make an election under paragraph 85(2) (disapplication of paragraphs 86 and 87), and
(b)
in relation to the subsequent TTH election, the total TTH amount exceeds the total amount of the first purchaser's eligible ring fence profits for—
(i)
the accounting period which is, at the licence transfer date in relation to the subsequent TTH election, the first purchaser's most recent qualifying accounting period in respect of which the amendment period has ended, and
(ii)
each earlier accounting period which is, in relation to the first TTH election, a post-acquisition accounting period of the first purchaser.
(2)
In the application of this Schedule for the purposes of the subsequent TTH election—
(a)
in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 30 (TTH activation event), the reference to an allowance or allocation made to the purchaser includes a reference to the relevant proportion (within the meaning of paragraph 83(5)) of an allowance or allocation made to the first purchaser;
(b)
in paragraph 30(2)(b) and (3)(b), and in paragraph 31 (decommissioning expenditure amount), references to a post-acquisition accounting period of the purchaser include references to the accounting periods of the first purchaser mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b)(i) and (ii);
(c)
in paragraph 30(3) as it applies in relation to the accounting periods of the first purchaser mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b)(i) and (ii), the reference to amounts attributable to the TTH asset is to be treated as a reference to the relevant proportion (within the meaning of paragraph 83(5)) of those amounts;

in paragraph 30(5) as it applies for the purposes of determining the total decommissioning expenditure amount in relation to an accounting period of the first purchaser mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(b)(i) or (ii), the reference to the purchaser is to be treated as a reference to the first purchaser;
(e)
in paragraph 83 and in sub-paragraph (1)(b) of this paragraph, references to an amount of the first purchaser's eligible ring fence profits do not include references to an original TTH amount.89
(1)

(a)
the transferred adjusted ring fence profits amount for each relevant accounting period, or
(b)
if the first TTH asset is not the same as the subsequent TTH asset, the relevant proportion of that amount for that period,
were an amount of the first purchaser's eligible adjusted ring fence profits for that period.
(2)
For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1)(b), “the relevant proportion” means the proportion that the subsequent TTH asset bears to the first TTH asset or, if the proportion cannot reasonably be determined on that basis, such other proportion determined on a just and reasonable basis.90
(1)
This paragraph applies if, after the effective date of the subsequent TTH election, the first purchaser continues to be liable for the decommissioning costs, or for a proportion of the decommissioning costs, for the subsequent TTH asset.
(2)
In the application of this Schedule for the purposes of the subsequent TTH election, references to the “purchaser” in paragraph 65 are to be treated, in respect of the period beginning with the effective date of the subsequent TTH election, as including references to the second purchaser.91
In the case of a sale by the second purchaser, or a subsequent sale, of an interest within paragraph 81(c) in respect of which the parties make a TTH election—

the reference to the first purchaser in sub-paragraph (1) is treated as including a reference to the second purchaser, or a subsequent purchaser, and
(ii)
sub-paragraph (2) applies in relation to each subsequent purchaser as it applies in relation to the second purchaser.92

the seller and the purchaser would be entitled to jointly make a TTH election in respect of more than one interest in the same oil field that falls within both licensed areas.
(2)
The seller and purchaser may jointly make a TTH election in respect of all interests in the oil field.
(3)
If an election is made in accordance with this paragraph, the interests mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) are to be treated as a single interest for the purposes of this Schedule (and references in this Schedule to “the TTH asset” are to be construed accordingly).93
(1)
This paragraph applies if, in a loss period, more than one TTH election in respect of the TTH asset has effect in relation to the purchaser.
(2)
For the purposes of paragraph 44 (allocation of activated TTH to an accounting period)—

(6)
Subject to this paragraph and (in the case of an appeal within sub-paragraph (1)(a)) paragraph 70, the provisions of Part 5 of TMA 1970 relating to appeals have effect in relation to appeals under this paragraph as they have effect in relation to appeals against an assessment to corporation tax.95

(2)
The first condition is that, as a result of a relevant share issue, the company ceases to be the individual's personal company.
(3)
The second condition is that—
(a)
if, immediately before the relevant share issue, the individual had made a disposal at their relevant value of all assets consisting of shares in or securities of the company, the disposal would have been a material disposal of business assets, and
(b)
if a claim for entrepreneurs' relief had been made in respect of that disposal, a chargeable gain would have been treated by section 169N(2) as accruing to the individual.
(4)
Where this section has effect, the individual is to be treated for the purposes of this Act—
(a)
as having made a disposal immediately before the relevant share issue of all assets consisting of shares in or securities of the company, and
(b)
immediately after that event, as having reacquired those assets,
at their relevant value.
(5)
In this section—
“material disposal of business assets” and “personal company” have the same meanings as in Chapter 3 (see section 169S),
“relevant share issue” means an issue of shares by the company where—
(a)
the shares are issued by the company for consideration consisting wholly of cash, and
(b)
the shares are subscribed, and issued, for genuine commercial reasons and not as part of arrangements the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is to secure a tax advantage to any person, and
“relevant value” means—
(a)
in relation to an asset consisting of shares, an amount equal to the consideration that would be apportioned to the asset if, immediately before the relevant share issue, the whole of the issued share capital of the company were sold for a consideration equal to its market value at that time, or
(b)
in relation to any other asset, its market value at the time of the relevant share issue.

(b)
references to “the notional gain” are references to the chargeable gain mentioned in subsection (3)(b), and
(c)
references to shares in or securities of a company include references to interests in such shares or securities.
169SD
Supplementary election to defer gains until subsequent disposal
(1)
An individual who makes an election under section 169SC may also elect that, for the purposes of this Act—
(a)
no chargeable gain or allowable loss is to be treated as accruing to the individual on the notional disposal, but
(b)
a chargeable gain calculated in accordance with this section is to be treated as accruing to the individual on any subsequent disposal by the individual of one or more assets consisting of shares in or securities of the company (in addition to any gain or loss that actually accrues on that disposal).
(2)
The chargeable gain treated as accruing to the individual on a subsequent disposal is the amount resulting from the following steps—
Step 1 Attribute the notional gain to each of the classes of shares in or securities of the company which are the subject of the notional disposal. The attribution must be made, in relation to each class, by reference to the proportion that—
(a)
the relevant gains (see section 169N(5)) accruing on the notional disposal in respect of shares or securities within each class bears to
(b)
the total amount of relevant gains accruing on the notional disposal.
Step 2 Apportion the amount attributed to each class under Step 1 to the shares or securities of that class which are the subject of the subsequent disposal. The apportionment must be by reference to the proportion that—
(a)
the nominal value of the shares or securities of that class which are the subject of the subsequent disposal bears to
(b)
the nominal value of shares or securities of that class which are the subject of the notional disposal.
Step 3 The amount resulting from these steps is—
(a)
the total of the amounts apportioned to shares or securities under Step 2, but
(b)
excluding, in relation to each class of shares or securities, so much of those amounts as would, together with any chargeable gains treated by this section as accruing on previous disposals of shares or securities of that class, exceed the amount attributed to that class under Step 1.
(3)
If the subsequent disposal is a disposal by virtue of section 122, the nominal value of shares of a particular class which are the subject of that disposal is to be treated for the purposes of Step 2 of subsection (2) as being equal to the nominal value of shares of that class as are the subject of the notional disposal.

(a)
there must be calculated the chargeable gain that would have been treated by section 169SD(1)(b) as accruing to the individual if, at the time of the relevant transaction, the old asset had been disposed of immediately before that transaction,
(b)
the whole or a corresponding part of the chargeable gain mentioned in paragraph (a) is to be treated as accruing on the subsequent disposal of the whole or part of the new asset (in addition to any gain or loss that actually accrues on that disposal and any chargeable gain treated by section 116(10)(b) as accruing on that disposal), and
(c)
on that subsequent disposal, section 115 (exemptions for gilt-edged securities and qualifying corporate bonds) has effect only in relation to any gain that actually accrues and not in relation to any gain which is treated as accruing by virtue of paragraph (b).
(3)
In subsection (2) “the new asset”, “the old asset” and “the relevant transaction” have the same meanings as in section 116.
169SF
Application of section 169SD where sections 127 to 130 apply
(1)
This section has effect in any case where a transaction occurs to which sections 127 to 130 (treatment of share capital following a reorganisation) apply by virtue of any provision of Chapter 2 of Part 4.
(2)
If a gain is treated by section 169SD(1)(b) as accruing on a subsequent disposal of the new holding and it is necessary to apportion the gain between shares or securities forming part of that new holding, the apportionment must be made in the same proportions as those in which the costs of acquisition of the original shares fall to be apportioned under the provisions of that Chapter.
(3)
If subsection (3) of section 128 (consideration given or received by holder) has effect in relation to an individual, the individual is treated for the purposes of section 169SD as making the disposal of the interest in the original shares mentioned in that subsection.
(4)
In this section “the new holding” and “the original shares” have the same meanings as in sections 127 to 130 (see section 126).

(2)
The individual making the subsequent disposal must make a claim for entrepreneurs' relief on or before the first anniversary of the 31 January following the first tax year in which, as a result of the election, the chargeable gain is to be treated as accruing.
(3)
The chargeable gain is to be treated for the purposes of section 169N as the amount resulting from a calculation under subsection (1) of that carried out when that chargeable gain accrues and because of the claim mentioned in subsection (2).
(4)
If the chargeable gain is a part only of the notional gain, each chargeable gain that subsequently accrues is to be treated for the purposes of section 169N as the amount resulting from a calculation under subsection (1) of that section carried out when that chargeable gain arises and because of the claim mentioned in subsection (2).
(5)
In relation to the claim for entrepreneurs' relief in respect of the chargeable gain, the company is to be treated for the purposes of condition A in section 169I(6) as if it were, throughout the period of 2 years ending with the date of the subsequent disposal, the individual's personal company.”4

Where the gaming duty provisions of this Act have effect in relation to any premises as if accounting periods were periods longer or shorter than six months (“alternative accounting periods”) as a result of—
(a)
a direction under paragraph 9(1A) of Schedule 1, or
(b)
a direction or agreement under paragraph 9(1C) of Schedule 1,
then for the purposes of determining the amount of gaming duty which is to be charged on those premises for that period, the Table in subsection (2) is modified in accordance with subsection (4B).
(4B)
Each amount specified in column 1 of the Table is multiplied by—
where—
A is the number of days in the alternative accounting period directed or agreed, and
B is the number of days in the period that would have been the accounting period in the absence of any direction or agreement (or where the alternative accounting period spans more than one such period, the first of those periods).”2

(2)
For sub-paragraph (1) substitute—

Where the Commissioners and every relevant person so agree, the gaming duty provisions of this Act shall have effect in relation to any premises as if accounting periods for the purposes of those provisions were the periods specified in the agreement, which may be—
(a)
periods of six months (beginning on any date);
(b)
periods (beginning on any date) which are longer or shorter than six months, but which must be the approximate equivalent of periods of six months in weeks.
(1A)
If the Commissioners have reason to believe that the liability in relation to any premises may not be discharged as it falls due from time to time, the Commissioners may direct that periods shorter than six months are to be treated as accounting periods for the purposes of the gaming duty provisions of this Act.
(1B)
The Commissioners may direct in relation to any premises that periods beginning on dates other than 1st April and 1st October are to be treated as accounting periods for the purposes of the gaming duty provisions of this Act.
(1C)
The Commissioners may by direction or by agreement with every relevant person make transitional arrangements in relation to any premises for periods (whether of six months or otherwise) to be treated as accounting periods for the purposes of the gaming duty provisions of this Act where—
(a)
those premises cease to be specified in an entry on the gaming register for any person, or
(b)
an agreement under sub-paragraph (1) or a direction under sub-paragraph (1A) or (1B) begins or ceases to have effect.
(1D)
The Commissioners must not enter into an agreement under sub-paragraph (1) or give a direction under sub-paragraph (1B) unless they are satisfied that any transitional arrangements which are appropriate for the protection of the revenue have been agreed or directed.
(1E)
Any direction under this paragraph continues to have effect until it is withdrawn by the Commissioners (unless otherwise specified in the direction).
(1F)
Withdrawal of a direction under this paragraph in relation to any premises does not prevent the giving of further directions in relation to those premises.”.
(3)
In sub-paragraph (2), for “sub-paragraph (1) above” substitute “ this paragraph ”.
(4)
Omit sub-paragraphs (3) and (4).
(5)
For sub-paragraph (5) substitute—
“(5)
The decisions mentioned in sub-paragraph (6) are to be treated as if they were listed in subsection (2) of section 13A of FA 1994 (customs and excise reviews and appeals: meaning of “relevant decision”) and accordingly are to be treated—
(a)
as if they were relevant decisions for the purposes mentioned in subsection (1) of that section, and
(b)
as if they were ancillary matters for the purposes of section 16 FA 1994 (appeals to a tribunal).
(6)
The decisions are—
(a)
a decision of the Commissioners to refuse a request for an agreement under sub-paragraph (1) or (1C), or to refuse a request for such an agreement on particular terms,
(b)
a decision of the Commissioners to give a direction under sub-paragraph (1A), (1B) or (1C), or to give such a direction in particular terms, or
(c)
a decision of the Commissioners not to give a direction under sub-paragraph (1A), (1B) or (1C).”3
In paragraph 11(2) of Schedule 1 to FA 1997 (regulations), after “of this Act” insert “ or paragraph 9 of this Schedule ”.4

(b)
the value of the prizes provided by the banker to those taking part in such gaming otherwise than on behalf of a provider of the premises.
(10ZA)
Where the gross gaming yield from any premises in an accounting period is a negative amount (“amount X”)—
(a)
the gross gaming yield for those premises in that accounting period is treated as nil, and
(b)
amount X may be carried forward in reduction of the gross gaming yield for those premises for one or more later accounting periods.”5
In section 12 of FA 1997 (liability to pay gaming duty) omit subsections (4) and (6).6

(2)
The period to be treated as the accounting period for those premises is instead a period (a “transitional accounting period”) beginning on the date specified in the agreement and ending on 30 September 2019.
(3)
For the purposes of determining the amount of gaming duty which is to be charged on those premises for the transitional accounting period, the Table in section 11(2) of FA 1997 is modified in accordance with sub-paragraph (4).
(4)
Each amount specified in column 1 of the Table is multiplied by—
where—

At the end of Chapter 12 of Part 5 of CTA 2009 insert—
“Hybrid capital instruments
420A
Amounts payable in respect of hybrid capital instruments
(1)
This section applies if a loan relationship is a hybrid capital instrument for an accounting period of the debtor.
(2)
The Corporation Tax Acts have effect in relation to any person in respect of times in the accounting period as if any qualifying amount payable in respect of the hybrid capital instrument were not a distribution.
(3)
An amount is a “qualifying amount” so far as it would not be regarded as a distribution if it is assumed that any provision made by the loan relationship under which the debtor is entitled to defer or cancel a payment of interest under the loan relationship had not been made.
(4)
This section also needs to be read together with section 1015(1A) of CTA 2010 (which prevents hybrid capital instruments from being “special securities” as a result of being equity notes).”3
(1)
After section 475B of CTA 2009 insert—
“Meaning of “hybrid capital instrument”
475C
Meaning of “hybrid capital instrument”
(1)
For the purposes of this Part, a loan relationship is a “hybrid capital instrument” for an accounting period of the debtor if—
(a)
the loan relationship makes provision under which the debtor is entitled to defer or cancel a payment of interest under the loan relationship,
(b)
the loan relationship has no other significant equity features, and
(c)
the debtor has made an election in respect of the loan relationship which has effect for the period.
(2)
For the purposes of this section a loan relationship “has no other significant equity features” if under the loan relationship—
(a)
there are neither voting rights in the debtor (ignoring insignificant voting rights in the debtor) nor a right to exercise a dominant influence over the debtor,
(b)
any provision for altering the amount of the debt is limited to write-down or conversion events in qualifying cases, and
(c)
any provision for the creditor to receive anything other than interest or repayment of the debt is limited to conversion events in qualifying cases.
(3)
For the purposes of subsection (2)(a)—
(a)
the loan relationship makes provision for “insignificant voting rights in the debtor” if (and only if) the voting rights of any creditor under the loan relationship are limited to one vote exercisable in relation to matters generally affecting the debtor without conferring any special advantage or other right on the creditor, and
(b)
“a right to exercise a dominant influence over the debtor” means a right to give directions with respect to the debtor's operating and financial policies with which it is obliged to comply (whether or not they are for the debtor's benefit).
(4)
For the purposes of subsection (2)(b) a “write-down event” means—
(a)
a permanent release of some or all of the debt, or
(b)
a reduction in the amount of the debt (including to nil) in a case where provision is made for the reduction to be temporary (whether on the meeting of conditions or the exercise of a right or otherwise).
(5)
For the purposes of subsection (2) a “conversion event” means—
(a)
the conversion of the loan relationship into shares forming part of the debtor's ordinary share capital, or
(b)
the conversion of the loan relationship into shares forming part of the ordinary share capital of [F1a company (“C”) which, after the conversion, has control of the debtor or would have control of the debtor if C were taken to have all the rights and interests in the debtor of any company connected with C].
F2...
(6)
For the purposes of subsection (2), a loan relationship makes provision for a qualifying case if—
(a)
the provision applies only in the event that there is a material risk of the debtor becoming unable to pay its debts as they fall due,
(b)
the provision applies only in the event that the value of the debtor's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities, or
(c)
the provision is included in the loan relationship solely because of a need to comply with a regulatory or other legal requirement,
and, in each case, the provision in question does not include a right exercisable by the creditor.
(7)
Provision is not to be regarded as failing to meet the condition in subsection (2)(b) merely because, in the case of a write-down event mentioned in subsection (4)(b), it provides for a subsequent increase in the amount of the debt (but not above the original amount).
(8)
An election under this section—
(a)
is irrevocable,
[F3(b)
must be made before the end of the period of 6 months beginning with—
(i)
the day on which the company becomes a party to the loan relationship, or
(ii)
if (after becoming a party to the loan relationship) the loan relationship is amended so as to meet the conditions in subsection (1)(a) and (b), the first day of the company’s next accounting period, and
(c)
has effect for the accounting period in which the day mentioned in paragraph (b)(i) or (ii) falls and for subsequent accounting periods.]
(9)
But an election under this section has no effect if—
(a)
the company is a party to the loan relationship directly or indirectly in consequence of, or otherwise in connection with, any arrangements (within the meaning of section 455C(2)), and
(b)
the main purpose of, or one of the main purposes of, the arrangements is to secure a tax advantage for the company or any other person.”
(2)
In a case where a company became a party to a loan relationship before 1 January 2019, section 475C(8)(b) of CTA 2009 has effect as if the election were required to be made on or before 30 September 2019.

The following have effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019—
(a)
the provision made by paragraphs 1 to 4 and 6 so far as relating to corporation tax, and
(b)
the amendments made by paragraphs 5 and 7 to 9.11
An accounting period beginning before and ending on or after 1 January 2019 is to be treated for the purposes of the provision made by this Schedule (other than paragraph 12 or 13) as if so much of the period as falls before that date, and so much of the period as falls on or after that date, were separate accounting periods.12
(1)
This paragraph applies in the case of a security which was a regulatory capital security for the purposes of the Taxation of Regulatory Capital Securities Regulations 2013 immediately before 1 January 2019 (referred to in this Part of this Schedule as a “transitional qualifying instrument”).
(2)
The revocations made by paragraph 1 do not affect any case where regulation 3(2)(a) or (b), (3) or (3A) of those Regulations would have applied in relation to accounting periods ending on or before 31 December 2023 but for the provision made by paragraph 1.
(3)
In a case where sub-paragraph (2) has applied, paragraph 13 makes provision for corporation tax purposes in relation to an accounting period beginning on 1 January 2024 (“the 2024 period”) to bring in credits or debits in respect of a transitional qualifying instrument which exists immediately before that date so far as they would not otherwise be brought into account.
(4)
For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph 13, an accounting period beginning before and ending on or after 1 January 2024 is to be treated as if so much of the period as falls before that date, and so much of the period as falls on or after that date, were separate accounting periods.13
(1)
If there is a difference between—
(a)
the tax-adjusted carrying value of a transitional qualifying instrument which is an asset or liability at the end of an accounting period ending on 31 December 2023, and
(b)
the tax-adjusted carrying value of that instrument at the beginning of the 2024 period,
a credit or debit (as the case may be) of an amount equal to the difference must be brought into account for the purposes of Part 5 of CTA 2009 for the 2024 period in the same way as a credit or debit which is brought into account in determining the company's profit or loss for that period in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice.
(2)
For the purposes of this paragraph “tax-adjusted carrying value” is to be construed in accordance with—
(a)
section 465B of CTA 2009 (tax-adjusted carrying value in relation to the asset or liability representing a loan relationship), and
(b)
section 702 of CTA 2009 (tax-adjusted carrying value in relation to a contract).
(3)
Where in the 2024 period, in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice, the rights and liabilities under the transitional qualifying instrument have been treated as divided between—
(a)
a loan relationship, and
(b)
one or more derivative financial instruments or equity instruments,
the reference in this paragraph to the tax-adjusted carrying value of the transitional qualifying instrument means the sum of the tax-adjusted carrying values for each of those component instruments.
(4)
In sub-paragraph (3) “equity instrument” has the meaning it has for accounting purposes.14
(1)
This paragraph applies to a transitional qualifying instrument which qualified as a regulatory capital security as a result of falling within regulation 2(1)(c) or (d) of the Taxation of Regulatory Capital Securities Regulations 2013.
(2)
The revocations made by paragraph 1 do not affect the application of regulation 3(2)(c)(i) of those Regulations in a case where the writing down or conversion concerned took place before 1 July 2019.15
(1)
This paragraph applies if—
(a)
regulation 3(2)(c)(i) of the Taxation of Regulatory Capital Securities Regulations 2013 applied in relation to a transitional qualifying instrument as a result of the writing down of the principal amount of the security on a temporary basis, and
(b)
a credit was, accordingly, not brought into account under Part 5 of CTA 2009.
(2)
No debit is to be brought into account under that Part in respect of the writing up of the principal amount of the security in accordance with any regulatory requirements or the provisions governing the security.16
(1)
The provision made by paragraphs 1 to 4 has effect for the purposes of income tax in relation to payments made on or after 1 January 2019.
(2)
But the revocations made by paragraph 1—
(a)
do not affect the application of regulation 6 or 9 of the Taxation of Regulatory Capital Securities Regulations 2013 in relation to payments made before the day on which this Act is passed, and
(b)
do not, in the case of a transitional qualifying instrument, apply to payments made before 1 January 2024 in any case where regulation 6 or 9 of those Regulations would have applied but for the provision made by paragraph 1.17
The revocations made by paragraph 1 have effect for the purposes of capital gains tax in relation to disposals made on or after 1 January 2019.18
In so far as it relates to the definition of “corporate bond” in section 117(1) of TCGA 1992, the amendment made by paragraph 6 has effect in relation to disposals made on or after 1 January 2019.19
(1)
The Treasury may by regulations amend section 475C of CTA 2009.
(2)
The power conferred by this paragraph may not be exercised after 31 December 2019.
(3)
The regulations may contain incidental, supplementary, consequential and transitional provision and savings.
(4)
The consequential provision that may be made by the regulations includes provision amending any provision made by or under any Act.
(5)

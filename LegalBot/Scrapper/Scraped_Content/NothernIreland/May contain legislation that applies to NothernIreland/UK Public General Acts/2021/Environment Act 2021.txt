Environmental review
(1)
Where the OEP has given a decision notice to a public authority it may apply to the court for an environmental review, but only if—
(a)
it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the authority has failed to comply with environmental law, and
(b)
it considers that the failure is serious.
(2)
An environmental review is a review of alleged conduct of the authority that is described in the decision notice as constituting a failure to comply with environmental law.
(3)
An application for an environmental review may not be made—
(a)
before the earlier of—
(i)
the end of the period within which the authority must respond to the decision notice in accordance with section 36(3), and
(ii)
the date on which the OEP receives the authority’s response to that notice, or
(b)
before the expiry of any time limit which applies to the commencement of judicial review or other similar legal proceedings for questioning the alleged conduct.
(4)
Any restriction imposed by or under any other enactment on questioning the conduct of a public authority in legal proceedings does not apply to an environmental review.
(5)
On an environmental review the court must determine whether the authority has failed to comply with environmental law, applying the principles applicable on an application for judicial review.
(6)
If the court finds that the authority has failed to comply with environmental law, it must make a statement to that effect (a “statement of non-compliance”).
(7)
A statement of non-compliance does not affect the validity of the conduct in respect of which it is given.
(8)
Where the court makes a statement of non-compliance it may grant any remedy that could be granted by it on a judicial review other than damages, but only if Condition A or Condition B is met.
(9)
Condition A is that the court is satisfied that granting the remedy would not—
(a)
be likely to cause substantial hardship to, or substantially prejudice the rights of, any person other than the authority, or
(b)
be detrimental to good administration.
(10)
Condition B is that Condition A is not met but the court is satisfied that—
(a)
granting the remedy is necessary in order to prevent or mitigate serious damage to the natural environment or to human health, and
(b)
there is an exceptional public interest reason to grant it.
(11)
In deciding whether to grant a remedy the court must (subject to subsection (8)) apply the principles applicable on an application for judicial review; but this does not require the court to apply section 31(2A) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (High Court to refuse to grant relief where the outcome for the applicant not substantially different) on an environmental review in England and Wales.
(12)
If, on an environmental review, the court has made a statement of non-compliance in respect of a public authority, and the statement has not been overturned on appeal, the authority must publish a statement that sets out the steps it intends to take in light of the review.
(13)
A statement under subsection (12) must be published before the end of the 2 month period beginning with the day the review (including any appeal) concludes.
(14)
In this section—
“the court” means—
(a)
in relation to an environmental review arising under the law of England and Wales or Northern Ireland, the High Court, or
(b)
in relation to an environmental review arising under the law of Scotland, the Court of Session;
“enactment” has the same meaning as in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018;
“the principles applicable on an application for judicial review” means, in relation to an environmental review, the principles that would apply on an application for judicial review in the jurisdiction under which the environmental review arises;
“remedy” includes any relief or order.

Judicial review: powers to apply in urgent cases and to intervene
(1)

(a)
the OEP considers that the conduct constitutes a serious failure to comply with environmental law, and
(b)
the urgency condition is met.
(2)
The urgency condition is that making an application under subsection (1) (rather than proceeding under sections 35 to 38) is necessary to prevent, or mitigate, serious damage to the natural environment or to human health.
(3)
Section 31(2A), (3C) and (3D) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 (High Court to refuse to grant leave or relief where the outcome for the applicant not substantially different) does not apply to an application for judicial review made under subsection (1) in England and Wales.
(4)
If, on an application for judicial review or a statutory review made by virtue of subsection (1), there is a finding that a public authority has failed to comply with environmental law, and the finding has not been overturned on appeal, the authority must publish a statement that sets out the steps it intends to take in light of the finding.
(5)
A statement under subsection (4) must be published before the end of the 2 month period beginning with the day the proceedings relating to the application for judicial review or the statutory review (including any appeal) conclude.

are in respect of an application for judicial review or a statutory review, and
(b)
relate to an alleged failure by a public authority to comply with environmental law (however the allegation is framed in those proceedings).
(7)
If the OEP considers that the alleged failure, if it occurred, would be serious, it may apply to intervene in the proceedings (whether it considers that the public authority has, or has not, failed to comply with environmental law).
(8)
In this Part—
(a)
except in section 38, reference to an application for judicial review includes an application for the permission of the High Court or, as the case may be, the Court of Session to apply for judicial review;

Only a person entitled under section 12D to bring the appeal if permission is granted may apply for permission.
(3)
Where the Authority publishes a decision to modify the conditions of any appointment under section 12A(9), any application for permission to appeal is not to be made after the end of 20 working days beginning with the first working day after the day on which the decision is published.
(4)
An application for permission to appeal must be accompanied by all such information as may be required by appeal rules.
(5)
Appeal rules may require information contained in an application for permission to appeal to be verified by a statement of truth.

(b)
such other information as may be required by appeal rules.
(8)
The CMA’s decision whether to grant permission to appeal is to be taken by an authorised member of the CMA.
(9)
Before the authorised member decides whether to grant permission under this paragraph, the Authority must be given an opportunity of making representations or observations, in accordance with paragraph 3(2).
(10)
The CMA’s decision on an application for permission to appeal must be made—
(a)
where the Authority makes representations or observations in accordance with paragraph 3(2), before the end of 10 working days beginning with the first working day after the day on which those representations or observations are received;

the Authority has been given an opportunity of making representations or observations, in accordance with paragraph 3(2),
(c)
the appellant (or, where the appellant is within section 12D(2)(c) or (d), those represented by the appellant, or consumers, respectively) would incur significant costs if the decision were to have effect before the determination of the appeal, and

Section 90A
“SCHEDULE 7A
Biodiversity gain in England
PART 1
Overview and interpretation
Overview
1
(1)
This Schedule makes provision for grants of planning permission in England to be subject to a condition to secure that the biodiversity gain objective is met.
(2)
Paragraphs 2 to 12 have effect for the purposes of this Schedule.
Biodiversity gain objective
2
(1)
The biodiversity gain objective is met in relation to development for which planning permission is granted if the biodiversity value attributable to the development exceeds the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat by at least the relevant percentage.
(2)
The biodiversity value attributable to the development is the total of—
(a)
the post-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat,
(b)
the biodiversity value, in relation to the development, of any registered offsite biodiversity gain allocated to the development, and
(c)
the biodiversity value of any biodiversity credits purchased for the development.
(3)
The relevant percentage is 10%.
(4)
The Secretary of State may by regulations amend this paragraph so as to change the relevant percentage.
Biodiversity value and the biodiversity metric
3
References to the biodiversity value of any habitat or habitat enhancement are to its value as calculated in accordance with the biodiversity metric.
4
(1)
The biodiversity metric is a document for measuring, for the purposes of this Schedule, the biodiversity value or relative biodiversity value of habitat or habitat enhancement.
(2)
The biodiversity metric is to be produced and published by the Secretary of State.
(3)
The Secretary of State may from time to time revise and republish the biodiversity metric.
(4)
Before publishing or republishing the biodiversity metric the Secretary of State must consult such persons as the Secretary of State considers appropriate.
(5)
The Secretary of State may by regulations make transitional provision in relation to the revision and republication of the biodiversity metric.
(6)
The Secretary of State must lay the biodiversity metric, and any revised biodiversity metric, before Parliament.
Pre-development biodiversity value
5
(1)
In relation to any development for which planning permission is granted, the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat is the biodiversity value of the onsite habitat on the relevant date.
(2)
The relevant date is—
(a)
in a case in which planning permission is granted on application, the date of the application, and
(b)
in any other case, the date on which the planning permission is granted.
(3)
But the person submitting the biodiversity gain plan for approval and the planning authority may agree that the relevant date is to be a date earlier than that specified in sub-paragraph (2)(a) or (b) (but not a date which is before the day on which this Schedule comes into force in relation to the development).
(4)
This paragraph is subject to paragraphs 6 and 7.
6
If—
(a)
a person carries on activities on land on or after 30 January 2020 otherwise than in accordance with—
(i)
planning permission, or
(ii)
any other permission of a kind specified by the Secretary of State by regulations, and
(b)
as a result of the activities the biodiversity value of the onsite habitat referred to in paragraph 5(1) is lower on the relevant date than it would otherwise have been,
the pre-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat is to be taken to be its biodiversity value immediately before the carrying on of the activities.
7
Where planning permission is granted in respect of land which is registered in the biodiversity gain site register under section 100 of the Environment Act 2021, the pre-development biodiversity value of the land is the total of—
(a)
the biodiversity value of the onsite habitat on the relevant date, and
(b)
to the extent that it is not included within that value, the biodiversity value of the habitat enhancement which is, on that date, recorded in the register as habitat enhancement to be achieved on the land.
Post-development biodiversity value
8
(1)
In relation to any development for which planning permission is granted, the post-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat is the projected value of the onsite habitat as at the time the development is completed.
(2)
That value is to be calculated by taking the pre-development biodiversity value and—
(a)
if at the time the development is completed the development will, taken as a whole, have increased the biodiversity value of the onsite habitat, adding the amount of that increase, or
(b)
if at the time the development is completed the development will, taken as a whole, have decreased the biodiversity value of the onsite habitat, subtracting the amount of that decrease.
This is subject to paragraph 9.
9
(1)
This paragraph applies in relation to any development for which planning permission is granted where—
(a)
the person submitting the biodiversity gain plan for approval proposes to carry out works in the course of the development that increase the biodiversity value of the onsite habitat, and
(b)
the planning authority considers that the increase is significant in relation to the pre-development biodiversity value.
(2)
The increase in biodiversity value referred to in sub-paragraph (1) is to be taken into account in calculating the post-development biodiversity value of the onsite habitat only if the planning authority is satisfied that the condition in sub-paragraph (3) is met.
(3)
The condition is that any habitat enhancement resulting from the works referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(a) will, by virtue of—
(a)
a condition subject to which the planning permission is granted,
(b)
a planning obligation, or
(c)
a conservation covenant,
be maintained for at least 30 years after the development is completed.
(4)
The Secretary of State may by regulations amend sub-paragraph (3) so as to substitute for the period for the time being specified there a different period of at least 30 years.
Registered offsite biodiversity gains
10
(1)
“Registered offsite biodiversity gain” means any habitat enhancement, where—
(a)
the enhancement is required to be carried out under a conservation covenant or planning obligation, and
(b)
the enhancement is recorded in the biodiversity gain site register (as to which, see section 100 of the Environment Act 2021).
(2)
References to the allocation of registered offsite biodiversity gain are to its allocation in accordance with the terms of the conservation covenant or planning obligation referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(a).
(3)
The biodiversity value of registered offsite biodiversity gain is measured, under the biodiversity metric, in relation to development to which it is allocated.
Biodiversity credits
11
“Biodiversity credits” means credits under section 101 of the Environment Act 2021.
General
12
(1)
In relation to development for which planning permission is granted—
“onsite habitat” means habitat on the land to which the planning permission relates;
“planning authority” means the local planning authority, except that—
(a)
in a case where the planning permission is granted by Mayoral development order under section 61DB, “planning authority” means such of the Mayor of London or the local planning authority as may be specified in the order;
(b)
in a case where the planning permission is granted by the Secretary of State under section 62A, 76A or 77, “planning authority” means such of the Secretary of State or the local planning authority as the Secretary of State may determine;
(c)
in a case where the planning permission is granted on an appeal under section 78, “planning authority” means such of the person determining the appeal or the local planning authority as that person may direct.
(2)

SCHEDULE 10
Performance of functions relating to financial market infrastructure
PART 1
New Chapter 2A of Part 18 of FSMA 2000
1
In Part 18 of FSMA 2000 (recognised investment exchanges, clearing houses and CSDs), before Chapter 3B insert—
“CHAPTER 2A
Performance of functions of recognised bodies
Relevant recognised bodies
309A
Recognised bodies to which this Chapter applies
(1)
The Treasury may by regulations specify as a “relevant recognised body” for the purposes of this Chapter a type of recognised body mentioned in subsection (2).
(2)
The types of recognised bodies are—
(a)
recognised investment exchanges;
(b)
recognised central counterparties;

(3)
Before making regulations under subsection (1), the Treasury—
(a)
must consult the FCA if it proposes to specify recognised investment exchanges (or recognised investment exchanges of a specified description);
(b)
must consult the Bank of England if it proposes to specify recognised central counterparties or recognised CSDs (or recognised central counterparties or recognised CSDs of a specified description);
(c)
in any case, must consult such persons as appear to it to be representative of interests likely to be affected by the application of this Chapter to the types, or descriptions, of bodies it proposes to specify.
(4)
In this Chapter, references to “the appropriate regulator” are to be read in accordance with section 285A (accordingly, the appropriate regulator in relation to a recognised investment exchange is the FCA, and in any other case is the Bank of England).
(5)
Nothing in this Chapter applies to overseas investment exchanges.

A Part 18 prohibition order may relate to—
(a)
a specified activity, any activity falling within a specified description or all activities (but see subsection (5));

a relevant recognised body (whether or not the appropriate regulator making the order is the appropriate regulator in relation to relevant recognised bodies of that type),
(b)
an authorised person,
(c)
an exempt person (other than a relevant recognised body), or
(d)
a person to whom, as a result of Part 20, the general prohibition does not apply in relation to a regulated activity.
(5)
If a Part 18 prohibition order makes provision in relation to a person or persons falling within subsection (4)(b), (c) or (d), subsection (3)(a) applies in relation to such provision as if references to an activity or activities were to a regulated activity or regulated activities.
(6)
In this section, “specified” means specified in the Part 18 prohibition order.
309C
Procedure for making Part 18 prohibition orders
(1)
If the appropriate regulator proposes to make a Part 18 prohibition order it must—
(a)
comply with such consultation requirements as may be prescribed, and
(b)
give the individual to whom the order would apply a warning notice.
(2)
A warning notice under subsection (1)(b) must set out the terms of the prohibition.
(3)
If the appropriate regulator decides to make a Part 18 prohibition order it must give the individual to whom the order applies a decision notice.
(4)
The decision notice must—
(a)
name the individual to whom the Part 18 prohibition order applies, and
(b)
set out the terms of the order.
(5)

22
(1)
Before the Bank exercises a stabilisation power in respect of a CCP, it must ensure that the assets and liabilities of the CCP are valued.

Unless sub-paragraph (4) applies, the Bank must arrange for the appointment of an independent valuer in accordance with paragraph 24 to carry out a valuation for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1).
(4)
Where the Bank considers that the urgency of the case makes it appropriate to exercise the stabilisation power before a valuation can be carried out by a person appointed in accordance with sub-paragraph (3), the Bank may carry out a provisional valuation of the assets and liabilities of the CCP for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1).
(5)
In carrying out a valuation required under sub-paragraph (1), the person carrying out the valuation must—
(a)
make prudent assumptions as to possible rates of default and the severity of losses suffered by the CCP,

(d)
apply any relevant methodology specified in regulations made under this paragraph.
(6)
A provisional valuation carried out under sub-paragraph (4) must in particular make provision in respect of additional losses by the CCP in accordance with any regulations made under this paragraph.

A valuation under sub-paragraph (1) must be accompanied by—
(a)
a balance sheet of the CCP as at the date of the valuation,
(b)
a report on the financial position of the CCP,
(c)
an analysis and an estimate of the accounting value of the assets of the CCP,
(d)
a list of the outstanding liabilities of the CCP (including any off-balance sheet liabilities), with the creditors subdivided into classes according to the priority their claims would receive in insolvency proceedings, and

an estimate of the amount that each class of creditors and shareholders might be expected to receive if the CCP went into insolvent liquidation.

Where appropriate, the information in sub-paragraph (7)(c) may be supplemented by an analysis and estimate of the value of the assets and liabilities of the CCP on a market value basis.
(9)
Where a provisional valuation is carried out under sub-paragraph (4), the Bank need only comply with sub-paragraph (7) as far as it is reasonable to do so in the circumstances.
(10)
The Treasury may by regulations make provision for the purposes of a valuation under this paragraph specifying—
(a)
the methodology for assessing the value of the assets and liabilities of a CCP;
(b)
the methodology for calculating and including a buffer for additional losses in the provisional valuation.
(11)

Third-country resolution actions
Third-country resolution actions
145
(1)
This paragraph applies where the Bank is notified of third-country resolution action in respect of a third-country central counterparty.
(2)
The Bank must make an instrument which—
(a)
recognises the action,
(b)
refuses to recognise the action, or
(c)
recognises part of the action and refuses to recognise the remainder.
An instrument within paragraph (a), (b) or (c) is a “third-country instrument” (as is an instrument under paragraph 146).
(3)
The Bank may only make a decision under sub-paragraph (2) with the approval of the Treasury.
(4)
Recognition of the action (or a part of it) may be refused only if the Bank and the Treasury are satisfied that one or more of the following conditions are satisfied—
(a)
recognition would have an adverse effect on financial stability in the United Kingdom;
(b)
under the third-country resolution action creditors (including in particular clearing members) located or payable in the United Kingdom would not, by reason of being located or payable in the United Kingdom, receive the same treatment as creditors who are located or payable in the country concerned and have similar legal rights;
(c)
recognition of, and taking action in support of, the third-country resolution action (or the part) would have material fiscal implications for the United Kingdom;
(d)
recognition would be unlawful under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (public authority not to act contrary to Human Rights Convention).
(5)
The recognition of a third-country resolution action (or any part of it) is without prejudice to any normal insolvency proceedings.
(6)
In this paragraph—
“third-country central counterparty” has the meaning given by section 285 of FSMA 2000;
“third-country resolution action” means action under the law of a country or territory outside the United Kingdom to manage the failure or likely failure of a third-country central counterparty—
(a)
the anticipated results of which are, in relation to a third-country central counterparty, broadly comparable to results which could have been anticipated from the exercise of a stabilisation option in relation to an entity in the United Kingdom corresponding to the third-country central counterparty, and
(b)
the objectives of which are broadly comparable, in relation to the country or territory concerned, to the special resolution objectives in paragraph 15 as they apply in relation to the United Kingdom.

Effects of recognition on third-country resolution action
146
(1)
This paragraph applies where an instrument under paragraph 145 recognises any third-country resolution action (or a part of it).
(2)
The third-country resolution action (or part) produces the same legal effects in any part of the United Kingdom as it would have produced had it been made (with due authority) under the law of that part of the United Kingdom.
(3)
For the purposes of supporting, or giving full effect to, the third-county resolution action (or the part), the Bank may exercise, in relation to a third-country central counterparty, one or more of the stabilisation options, or one or more of the stabilisation powers, available to the Bank in relation to a similar entity in the United Kingdom.
(4)
But, for the purposes of exercising a power by virtue of sub-paragraph (3), provision which could otherwise be made under this Schedule in a share transfer instrument, property transfer instrument or resolution instrument may instead be made in—
(a)
the instrument made under paragraph 145 recognising the third-country resolution action (or part), or
(b)
a further instrument made by the Bank under this paragraph.
An instrument under paragraph (b) is a “third-country instrument” (as is an instrument under paragraph 145(2)(a), (b) or (c)).
(5)
This Schedule (other than this paragraph) applies in relation to the exercise of any power by virtue of sub-paragraph (3), subject to sub-paragraphs (6) and (7) and any other necessary modifications.
(6)
Paragraph 15 (special resolution objectives) has effect as if after sub-paragraph (7) there were inserted—
“(7A)
Objective 6 is to support third-country resolution action with a view to promoting objectives which, in relation to the country or territory concerned, correspond to Objectives 1 to 5 in relation to the United Kingdom.”

Introductory
Application of this Schedule
1
This Schedule applies in relation to an insurer while the insurer is in financial difficulties.
“Financial difficulties”
2
(1)
An insurer is in “financial difficulties” for the purposes of this Schedule if—
(a)
Part 1 of Schedule 19B (write-down orders: restrictions on enforcement) has effect in relation to the insurer (see paragraph 1(1) and (2) of that Schedule);
(b)
the insurer is in administration, within the meaning of Schedule B1 to the 1986 Act or Schedule B1 to the 1989 Order, or awaiting administration;
(c)
a petition for the winding up of the insurer has been presented and has not been withdrawn or determined.

the application has not yet been granted or dismissed, or
(b)
the application has been granted but the administration order has not yet taken effect.
(3)
For the purposes of this Schedule, an insurer “enters into financial difficulties”—

(b)
in a case to which sub-paragraph (1)(b) applies, on the date on which the application for the administration order is made to the court;
(c)
in a case to which sub-paragraph (1)(c) applies, on the date on which the winding-up petition is presented.
PART 2

Restriction on policyholder surrender rights
3
(1)
Where this Schedule applies in relation to an insurer, the total value of a policyholder’s rights under a relevant contract of insurance which the policyholder may surrender in a relevant period must not exceed the surrender limit for that period.
(2)
For these purposes—
“relevant contract of insurance” means a contract of long-term insurance which is not a contract in respect of which the following conditions are met—
(a)
the benefits under the contract are payable only on death or in respect of incapacity due to injury, sickness or infirmity;
(b)
the contract has no surrender value, or the consideration consists of a single premium and the surrender value does not exceed that premium;
(c)
the contract makes no provision for its conversion or extension in a manner which would result in it ceasing to comply with either of the above conditions;
“relevant period” means—
(a)
the period of 12 months beginning with the date on which the insurer entered into financial difficulties, and
(b)
each subsequent period of 12 months;
“surrender limit”, in relation to a relevant contract of insurance and relevant period, is an amount equal to 5% of the total surrender value of the contract on the day on which the relevant period began.

where there is no relevant office-holder, the insurer.
(2)
For these purposes, “relevant office-holder” means—
(a)
a provisional liquidator of the insurer;
(b)
an administrator of the insurer;
(c)
a person appointed to act as the manager of a write-down order that has effect in relation to the insurer.
(3)
The court, a relevant office-holder or the insurer (as the case may be) may give consent under sub-paragraph (1) only if satisfied that not doing so would cause the policyholder hardship.
(4)
Where a provisional liquidator of an insurer has been appointed, the manager of a write-down order that has effect in relation to the insurer must obtain the consent of the provisional liquidator before giving consent under sub-paragraph (1).
(5)
As soon as reasonably practicable after giving consent under sub-paragraph (1), a relevant office-holder or the insurer must notify the PRA.

Restriction on termination etc
7
(1)
Where this Schedule applies in relation to an insurer, a provision of a relevant contract, entered into by the insurer before the insurer first enters into financial difficulties, ceases to have effect if, and to the extent that, under the provision—
(a)
the contract would terminate, a supply would cease, or any other thing would occur, because the insurer is in financial difficulties, or
(b)
another party to the contract would be entitled to terminate the contract, cease a supply, or do any other thing, because the insurer is in financial difficulties.
(2)
Where—
(a)
under a provision of a relevant contract, another party to the contract is entitled to terminate the contract, cease a supply, or do any other thing because of an event occurring before the insurer was in financial difficulties, and
(b)
the entitlement arises before the insurer was in financial difficulties,
the entitlement may not be exercised while the insurer is in financial difficulties.
(3)
A supplier of goods or services to an insurer must not—

(4)
The court, a relevant office-holder or the insurer (as the case may be) may give consent under sub-paragraph (2) only if satisfied that not doing so would cause hardship to any person.

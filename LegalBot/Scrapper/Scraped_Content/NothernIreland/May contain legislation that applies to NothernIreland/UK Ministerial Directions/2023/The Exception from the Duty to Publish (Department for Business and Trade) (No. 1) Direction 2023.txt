EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Direction) 
Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“the Act”), a 
Minister of the Crown may create an exception from the duty under paragraph 1(1) of the same 
Schedule for the King’s Printer to make arrangements for the publication of relevant instruments 
(i.e. EU regulations, EU decisions and EU tertiary legislation) published before exit day by an EU 
entity. 
The instrument set out in the Schedule to this Direction relates to European Union law on the 
statutory audit of ‘public interest entities’ (as defined in the Statutory Auditors and Third Country 
Auditors Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016 No. 649)). The provisions set out in the Schedule to this 
Direction are exempt from publication on account of their transposition into UK legislation. 
Section 3(2)(a)(iii) of the Act therefore applies, with the effect that those provisions do not 
constitute “direct EU legislation” within the meaning of the Act.

A senior officer of the Department for CommunitiesEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 95(5) of the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 216) and regulation 14(3)(b) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 218).
Regulation 95(4) and (5) of the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 and regulation 14(3) of the Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 apply where a claimant has previously carried out work of a particular nature, or at a particular level of remuneration. In such cases, the Department is required to limit work search and work availability requirements to work of a similar nature or level of remuneration, provided the Department is satisfied that the claimant will have reasonable prospects of obtaining paid work in spite of the limitation. The limitation is for such period as the Department thinks appropriate up to a maximum of 3 months. These Regulations amend the maximum period of the limitation to 4 weeks.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations includes a transitional provision so that any limitation that applies on the date that these Regulations come into operation will end either on the day before the day that the limitation no longer applies, or if earlier, 21st March 2024.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c.8) are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

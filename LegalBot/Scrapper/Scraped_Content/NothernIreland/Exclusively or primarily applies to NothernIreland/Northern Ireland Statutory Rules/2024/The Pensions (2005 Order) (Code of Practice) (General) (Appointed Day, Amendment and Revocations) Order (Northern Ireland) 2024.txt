(This is not part of the Order)
This Order appoints the day for the purposes of Article 86(7) of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 for the coming into operation of the Pensions Regulator General code of practice as 5th July 2024. The General code of practice consolidates ten existing codes of practice and provides guidance to those running occupational, personal, and public service pension schemes.
The General code of practice is available on the Pensions Regulator’s website: https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/document-library. Copies may be obtained by post from the Pensions Regulator, Telecom House, 125-135 Preston Road, Brighton, BN1 6AF.
Article 3 of this Order amends Article 2 of the Pensions (2005 Order) (Commencement No. 3, Appointed Day, Transitional Provisions and Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2005 by omitting paragraph (1) of that Article, which brought into effect the Pensions Regulator Code of Practice No. 1: Reporting breaches of the law. That code of practice is revoked with effect from 5th July 2024, under the Pensions (2005 Order) (Codes of Practice) (Revocation) Order (Northern Ireland) 2024 (S.R. 2024 No. 131) (“the 2024 Revocation Order”).
Article 4 of the Order revokes the eight Appointed Day Orders which brought into effect a number of other codes of practice issued by the Pensions Regulator, which have also been revoked by the 2024 Revocation Order.

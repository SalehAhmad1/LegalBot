Under the Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers’ Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 (“the 1979 Order”) lump sum payments may be made to certain persons disabled by a disease to which the 1979 Order applies, or to dependants of persons who were so disabled before they died. The diseases covered by the 1979 Order are pneumoconiosis, byssinosis, diffuse mesothelioma, and such other diseases as are specified by the Department.
Following amendments made to the diseases specified by the Department for the purposes of the 1979 Order, by the Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers’ Compensation) (Specified Diseases and Prescribed Occupations) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2024, these Regulations make consequential amendments to the Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers’ Compensation) (Payment of Claims) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1988 to amend the definition of “disease” and remove the definition of “primary carcinoma of the lung”.

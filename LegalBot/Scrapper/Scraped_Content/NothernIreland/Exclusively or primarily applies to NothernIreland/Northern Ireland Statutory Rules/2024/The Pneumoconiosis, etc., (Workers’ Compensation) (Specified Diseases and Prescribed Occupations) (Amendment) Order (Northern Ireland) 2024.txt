(This note is not part of the Order)
Under the Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers’ Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1979 (S.I. 1979/925 (N.I. 9)) (“the 1979 Order”) lump sum payments may be made to certain persons disabled by a disease to which the 1979 Order applies, or to dependants of persons who were so disabled before they died. The diseases covered by the 1979 Order are pneumoconiosis, byssinosis, diffuse mesothelioma, and such other diseases as are specified by the Department. The Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers’ Compensation) (Specified Diseases) Order (Northern Ireland) 1986 (S.R. 1986 No. 168) specifies additional diseases to which the 1979 Order applies.
The Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers’ Compensation) (Prescribed Occupations) Order (Northern Ireland) 2007 (S.R. 2007 No. 337) lists the occupations prescribed for the purpose of each disease to which the 1979 Order applies. It is a condition of entitlement under the 1979 Order that every relevant employer has ceased business. The occupations prescribed in S.R. 2007 No. 337 are relevant in determining whether there is a relevant employer.
Article 2 amends the diseases specified in S.R. 1986 No. 168 as follows—
a)
Primary carcinoma of the lung where there is accompanying evidence of asbestosis and/or bilateral diffuse pleural thickening has been replaced with asbestos-related primary carcinoma of the lung.
b)
Bilateral diffuse pleural thickening has been replaced with unilateral or bilateral diffuse pleural thickening.
Article 3 makes amendments to the occupations prescribed in S.R. 2007 No. 337 which are relevant to determine whether there is a relevant employer.

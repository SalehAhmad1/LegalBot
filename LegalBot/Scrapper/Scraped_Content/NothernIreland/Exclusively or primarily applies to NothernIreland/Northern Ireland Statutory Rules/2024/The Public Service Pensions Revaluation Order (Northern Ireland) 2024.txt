In relation to the period from 1st April 2023 to 31st March 2024 inclusive, article 2 of this Order specifies an increase in prices of 6.7 per cent, based on a measure of the year on year change in the Consumer Prices Index to September 2023; and an increase in earnings of 7.7 per cent, based on a measure of the year on year change in average weekly earnings to September 2023.
This Order comes into operation on 1st April 2024 but for the schemes specified in article 1(3), this order will have effect from 6th April 2024.

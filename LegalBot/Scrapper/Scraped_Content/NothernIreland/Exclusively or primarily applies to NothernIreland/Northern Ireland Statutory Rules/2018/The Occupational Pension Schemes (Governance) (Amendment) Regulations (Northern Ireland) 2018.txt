(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations implement the requirements relating to conditions governing activities under Title III of the European Union Directive (EU) 2016/2341 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (O.J. No. L354, 23.12.16, p.37) (“the Directive”).
Regulation 2 amends Article 226A of the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 (“the Order”) by substituting paragraphs (1) and (1A) for the existing paragraph (1). Substituted paragraph (1) imposes a duty on the trustees or managers of an occupational pension scheme to establish and operate an effective system of governance including internal controls. Paragraph (1A) requires that system to be proportionate to the size, nature, scale and complexity of the activities of the occupational pension scheme.
Regulation 3 sets out the matters to be included in the code of practice which the Pensions Regulator issues under Article 85(2) of the Order in relation to the duty imposed by Article 226A(1) of the Order.

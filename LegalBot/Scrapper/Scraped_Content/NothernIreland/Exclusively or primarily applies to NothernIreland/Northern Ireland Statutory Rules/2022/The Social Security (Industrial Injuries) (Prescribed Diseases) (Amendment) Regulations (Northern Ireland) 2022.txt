(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Industrial Injuries) (Prescribed Diseases) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1986 (S.R. 1986 No. 179).
Regulation 2 amends Part 1 of Schedule 1, which lists the diseases and the occupations for which they are prescribed, by amending the prescription for Dupuytren’s contracture and providing further specification on the circumstances in which Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit is payable. The reason for amending the prescription is to bring the regulations into line with the most up to date guidance from the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 7 of Schedule 5A to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2A) of that Act for prior reference to the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council.

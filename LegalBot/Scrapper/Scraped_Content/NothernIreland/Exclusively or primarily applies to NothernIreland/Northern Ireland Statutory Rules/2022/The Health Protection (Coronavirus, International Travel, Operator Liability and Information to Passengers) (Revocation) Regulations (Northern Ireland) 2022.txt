(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 and The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Operator Liability and Information to Passengers) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (the Operator Liability Regulations). They also revoke all previous Regulations which amended these Regulations. This comprises a revocation of all the Regulations governing international travel made in consequence of coronavirus.
Regulation 3 is a transitional provision which means that tests booked before these revocations take effect must still be undertaken if the person arrived in Northern Ireland before these revocations take effect.
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

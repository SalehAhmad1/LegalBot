Anne McCleary
A senior officer of the Department for CommunitiesEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations narrow the scope of investments that come within the definition of “employer-related investments” for large Master Trust schemes with 500 or more participating employers.
Regulation 2 amends the Occupational Pension Schemes (Requirement to obtain Audited Accounts and a Statement from the Auditor) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1997 so that the accounting requirements for large Master Trust schemes reflect the updated provisions on employer-related investments that apply in respect of those schemes.
Regulation 3 amends the Occupational Pension Schemes (Investment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 so that the restrictions on employer-related investments by large Master Trusts only apply to investments relating to a scheme funder, a scheme strategist and persons connected or associated with a scheme funder or a scheme strategist.
Regulation 4 amends the Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 so that the information that must be disclosed on request to members of large Master Trust schemes reflects the updated provisions on employer-related investments that apply in respect of those schemes.
As these Regulations, in so far as they are made under the Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain, the requirement to consult under Article 117(1) of that Order does not apply by virtue of paragraph (2)(e) of that Article.
An assessment of the cost to business of these Regulations is detailed in a Regulatory Impact Assessment, a copy of which has been laid in the Business Office and the Library of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Copies of the Assessment are available from the Department for Communities, Social Security Policy, Legislation and Decision Making Services, Level 6, Causeway Exchange, 1-7 Bedford Street, Belfast BT2 7EG or from the website: https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/articles/pension-information. A copy of the Assessment is also annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum which is available alongside this Statutory Rule on the website: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr.

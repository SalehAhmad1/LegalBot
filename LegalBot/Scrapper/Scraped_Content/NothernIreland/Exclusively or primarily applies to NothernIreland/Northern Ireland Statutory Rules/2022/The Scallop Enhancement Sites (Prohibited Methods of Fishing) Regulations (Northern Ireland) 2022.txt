(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations prohibit fishing for sea-fish by demersal mobile fishing gear and diving for scallops in a number of defined locations within the Northern Ireland zone which have been established as scallop reseeding sites. These sites are located at Ballyquintin, Drumfad Bay, Roaring Rock and Whitehead. An exception to this prohibition applies to those who have a permit granted from the Department under section 14 of the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1966 to fish for scientific purposes.
Contravention of the Regulations is an offence under section 124(3) of the Fisheries Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. The penalty on summary conviction is a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale (£5,000).

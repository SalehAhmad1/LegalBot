(This note is not part of the Order)
The Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (Prescribed Part) Order (Northern Ireland) 2006 (S.R. 2006 No. 25) sets out the method of calculation of the prescribed part. The prescribed part is the part of the property of a company that a liquidator, administrator, or receiver must reserve for unsecured creditors, under Article 150A of the insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, and which would otherwise be available to satisfy claims secured by a floating charge. The prescribed part is subject to a limit.
This Order increases the limit on the value of the prescribed part from £600,000 to £800,000.
The increased limit does not apply, where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first ranking floating charge created before this Order comes into operation.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this rule as it has minimal impact on the private, voluntary and public sectors.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (the principal regulations) and The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Operator Liability and Information to Passengers) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (the Operator Liability Regulations). They also revoke one provision of The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Operator Liability and Information to Passengers) (Amendment No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022.
Regulation 3 and the Schedule deal with the regime for exempting arrivals in Northern Ireland from the various coronavirus travel rules. They do so by simplifying the exemption regime for certain categories of person by merging many of the individual categories into larger categories. The Schedule also adds a new exemption category of seasonal and temporary horticultural and food processing workers.
Regulation 4 corrects an error made in an earlier commencement provision. Regulation 4 of Statutory Rule 2022 No. 43 extended the time a person had to complete a passenger locator form from two to three days before arrival in Northern Ireland. That provision was erroneously brought into operation on 11 February 2022 when it should have been brought into force on 28 February 2022. Regulation 4 of these Regulations corrects this error. Firstly, it provides that, as from 13 February 2022, the requirement is that a person has two days to complete the passenger locator form. Secondly, it provides that, as from 28 February 2022, a person will have three days to complete the form. Thirdly, it then revokes the provision which was erroneously brought into force too soon. Nothing in this regulation has retrospective effect.
Regulation 5 makes minor updates, including correcting typographical or cross-referencing errors as well as updating web links.
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These regulations replace head (ii) of sub-paragraph 17(2)(c) of the Rate Relief (Qualifying Age) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 to further modify Schedule 4 to the Housing Benefit (Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006). This is to align with an amendment made to those regulations to ensure the 10% increase in the personal allowance is maintained for all couples for the purposes of the rate relief scheme.

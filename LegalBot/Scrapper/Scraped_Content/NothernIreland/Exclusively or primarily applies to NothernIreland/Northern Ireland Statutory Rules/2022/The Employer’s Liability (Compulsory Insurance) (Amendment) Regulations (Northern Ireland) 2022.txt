(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Employer’s Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999 (“the 1999 Regulations”). The 1999 Regulations specify employers who are exempted from the requirements of Part III of the Employer’s Liability (Defective Equipment and Compulsory Insurance) (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 (“the 1972 Order”) to insure and maintain insurance against liability for personal injury suffered by their employees and arising out of and in the course of their employment. The specified employers are certain public bodies; the specified classes of employer include any employers to the extent that they are required to insure under a compulsory motor insurance scheme by virtue of the fact that their employees are carried on, or are alighting from or are entering into, a motor vehicle. The exemptions specified in the 1999 Regulations are additional to those contained in Article 7 of the 1972 Order.
These Regulations add the Commissioner for Survivors of Institutional Childhood Abuse, the Construction Industry Training Board, and the Victims’ Payments Board to the exemptions in Schedule 2 to the 1999 Regulations.

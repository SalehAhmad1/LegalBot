(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Building Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2012 (as amended) (the principal Regulations) and they come into operation on 1st April 2022. They do not apply to building work which has been completed, or for which plans or building notices have been deposited with a district council before that date. These Regulations were notified in draft to the European Commission in accordance with Directive 2015/1535/EU.
These Regulations amend the principal Regulations as follows—
Regulation 5 amends the Table to Regulation 8 (Application to material change of use) and the Notes to Table to Regulation 8 in Part A (Interpretation and general) to demonstrate for each Case whether the new requirement in Regulation 23(2) applies.
Regulation 6 amends Part B (Materials and workmanship):
1.  Regulation 22 has been amended to give two new definitions for “External wall” and “Specified attachment”.
2.  Regulation 23 has been amended to include:
(i)
a new requirement 23(2) which requires that only materials achieving European Classification A2-s1, d0 or A1 may become part of an external wall or specified attachment of a ‘relevant building’. It in effect bans the use of combustible materials in those situations;
(ii)
in 23(3) a list of various items that are to be exempt from the new requirement in 23(2); and
(iii)
in 23(4) new definitions for “relevant building” and “above ground level”.
Regulation 7 amends Part C (Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture) to amend the definition of “Radon affected area” to make reference to a Public Health England publication ‘Radon in Northern Ireland: Indicative Atlas’ of 2015.
The Department of Finance has prepared an Amendments Booklet (AMD 7) giving guidance for the purposes of the Part B and Part C requirements. Copies of AMD 7 and the Regulatory Impact Assessments may be downloaded from www.finance-ni.gov.uk/topics/building-regulations-and-energy-efficiency-buildings or alternatively, hard copies may be requested from Building Standards Branch, Department of Finance, 6th Floor, Goodwood House, 44-58 May Street, Belfast, BT1 4NN.

Minister of JusticeEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Rules)
Rule 22A was added to the Parole Commissioners’ Rules (Northern Ireland) 2009 by the Parole Commissioners’ (Amendment) Rules (Northern Ireland) 2021. It enabled registered victims or other persons to make a request for a summary of the reasons for a final direction of a single Commissioner under Rule 13(2)(b) or of a decision of a panel made in oral proceedings under Rule 24(2) to be produced and disclosed by the single Commissioner or the chairman of the panel, respectively.
The Parole Commissioners’ (Amendment) Rules (Northern Ireland) 2022 replace Rule 22A to provide that a summary is to be produced by a Commissioner appointed by the Chief Commissioner, unless the appointed Commissioner decides there are exceptional circumstances why a summary should not be produced. Replacement Rule 22A also prohibits the disclosure in a summary of the names of any persons concerned in the proceedings, except the parties, or the disclosure of other information about the proceedings except insofar as the appointed Commissioner directs.
These amendment Rules also provide in new Rule 22B for an appeal against a decision not to produce a summary. The appeal is to the Chief Commissioner, who must direct that a summary is to be produced for disclosure or not to be so produced, and whose direction is final.
There is also a transitional provision.
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Rules.

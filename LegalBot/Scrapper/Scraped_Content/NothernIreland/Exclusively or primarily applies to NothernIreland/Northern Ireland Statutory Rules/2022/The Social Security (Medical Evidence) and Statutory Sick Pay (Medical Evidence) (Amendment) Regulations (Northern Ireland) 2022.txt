11th March 2022EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Medical Evidence) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1976 (“the 1976 Regulations”) and the Statutory Sick Pay (Medical Evidence) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1985 (“the 1985 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(2), (3) and (4) amends the 1976 Regulations by removing the requirement for a doctor’s statement to be completed in ink or other indelible substance and for it to be signed by the doctor providing the statement. In place of the requirement for a doctor’s statement to be signed by the doctor, regulation 2(4)(c) requires that the name of the doctor, whether in the form of a signature or otherwise, be contained within the statement. Regulation 2(2) and (3) also amends the 1976 Regulations to permit the statement to be in the form provided for in Part 11 or Part 11A. Regulation 2(5) inserts a new Part 11A which contains an additional version of the doctor’s statement.
Regulation 3(2) removes part of the definition of “signature”, which is rendered superfluous by these Regulations. Regulation 3(3), (4) and (5) amends the 1985 Regulations by removing the requirement for a doctor’s statement to be completed in ink or other indelible substance and for it to be signed by the doctor providing the statement. In place of the requirement for a doctor’s statement to be signed by the doctor, regulation 3(5)(c) requires that the name of the doctor, whether in the form of a signature or otherwise, be contained within the statement. Regulation 3(3) and (4) amends the 1985 Regulations to permit the statement to be on the form provided for in Part 11 or Part 11. Regulation 3(6) inserts a new Part 11A which contains an additional version of the doctor’s statement.
These Regulations make, in relation to Northern Ireland, only provision corresponding to provision in regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations as it makes provision which is to have effect for a period of less than 12 months.

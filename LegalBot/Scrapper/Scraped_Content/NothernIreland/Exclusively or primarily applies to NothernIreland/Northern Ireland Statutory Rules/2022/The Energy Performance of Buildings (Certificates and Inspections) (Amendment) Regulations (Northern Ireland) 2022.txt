(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Energy Performance of Buildings (Certificates and Inspections) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008 (“the principal Regulations”)(1). The principal Regulations implement in part, Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the energy performance of buildings (recast)(2) (“the Directive”). That Directive was amended by Directive (EU) 2018/844 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018(3). The principal regulations were made in exercise of the powers conferred by section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972(4). That Act was repealed by section 1 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018(5) but the principal regulations continue to have effect as retained EU law by virtue of section 2(2) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
Regulation 3 amends the fees for entering data onto the register for energy performance certificates, display energy certificates and air conditioning inspection reports kept under regulation 25 (Registration of certificates etc.) of the principal regulations.

These Regulations amend the Provision of Health Services to Persons Not Ordinarily Resident Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015 (“the 2015 Regulations”) which make provision as to the entitlement of, and exemption from charges for, certain health services to visitors in Northern Ireland.
Regulations 2, 3 and 4 of these Regulations amend the 2015 Regulations to provide exemptions from charging in respect of services forming part of health services for those visitors who are lawfully present in the United Kingdom but are ordinarily resident in Ukraine, as well as exemptions for their family members, authorised companions (the definition for which is amended by regulation 2 to include persons accompanying visitors from Ukraine who are receiving a course of treatment) and authorised children.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations also provides in regulation 15A(4) of the 2015 Regulations that, in respect of such visitors, a charge determined by the Department in respect of services forming part of health services since 24th February 2022 shall not be charged or recovered, or shall be repaid.
Regulation 5 provides that general health services shall be made available to visitors who are lawfully present in the United Kingdom, but are ordinarily resident in Ukraine.

The Department for Infrastructure(a) makes the following Order in exercise of the powers 
conferred by Articles 10(4), 13(1) and (16) of, and paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 to, the Road Traffic 
Regulation (Northern Ireland) Order 1997(b) and now vested in it(c). 
It appears to the Department to be necessary to provide suitable parking places for vehicles on the 
lengths of the roads specified in the Schedule. 
The Department has consulted such persons as it considered appropriate in compliance with 
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Schedule 4 to the Road Traffic Regulation (Northern Ireland) Order 1997. 
The Department has published a notice in compliance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of that Schedule. 
The Department in compliance with paragraph 3(4) of that Schedule, has taken such other steps as 
appear to the Department reasonably practicable for the purpose of bringing specifically to the 
knowledge of the occupiers of land adjacent to the parking places the particulars specified in 
paragraph 3(2) of that Schedule. 
Three objections have been received and one has been subsequently withdrawn and no other 
representations have been received. 
The Department has modified the draft Order.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Environmental Offences (Fixed Penalties) (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2012 (“the principal Regulations”).
Regulation 3 of the principal Regulations prescribe the ranges within which the amounts of certain fixed penalties that are capable of being specified by a district council are required to fall.
Regulation 3 of these Regulations inserts a definition of the Dog Control Orders (Prescribed Offences and Penalties, etc.) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2012 into the principal Regulations.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations amends the principal Regulations to increase the range within which a district council may specify its own penalty amount under Article 6(6A)(a) of the Litter (Northern Ireland) Order 1994 for the offence of littering from between £50 and £80 to between £50 and £200.
Regulation 4 of these Regulations also amends the principal Regulations to increase the range within which a district council may specify its own penalty amount under section 44(1)(a) of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 for the offence of contravention of a dog control order relating to dog fouling from between £50 and £80 to between £50 and £200.
An impact assessment on the effect of these Regulations has not been prepared as they have no impact on the cost to business.

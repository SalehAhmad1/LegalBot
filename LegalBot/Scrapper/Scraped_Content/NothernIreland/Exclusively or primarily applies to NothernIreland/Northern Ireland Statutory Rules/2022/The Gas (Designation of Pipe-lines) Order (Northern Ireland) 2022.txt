Description of the pipe-line Date designation ending
The pipe-line known as the Kilroot Transmission Pipe-line which runs for 3 kilometres, from (and including) the Offtake Connection on the Belfast Gas Transmission Pipe-line at Marshallstown to (and including) the Pipe-line Inspection Gauge reception facility at Kilroot. 31 st December 2051EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Article 8(1) of the Gas (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 (“the Gas Order”) authorises the holder of a licence issued under sub-paragraph (a) to participate in the conveyance of gas from one place to another.
Such licences are subject to standard conditions. There may also be conditions attaching to a particular licence. Article 60(1) of the Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 provides for the Department for the Economy, after consultation with the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation, or that Authority with the consent of the Department, to modify the conditions of a particular licence, or the standard conditions where it considers it necessary or expedient to do so, for the purpose of implementing or facilitating the operation of arrangements designed to secure that prices charged in connection with the conveyance of gas through certain designated pipe-lines are in accordance with a common tariff which does not distinguish (whether directly or indirectly) between different parts of Northern Ireland or the extent of use of any such pipe-lines.
Article 2 and the Schedule to this Order designates a pipe-line to which this power of modification applies.
The pipe-line in the Schedule is designated from the date of coming into operation of the Order until the date specified opposite the reference to the pipe-line in the Schedule. However, the Order specifies certain events on the happening of which the Order will cease to have effect. These events are set out in Article 3.

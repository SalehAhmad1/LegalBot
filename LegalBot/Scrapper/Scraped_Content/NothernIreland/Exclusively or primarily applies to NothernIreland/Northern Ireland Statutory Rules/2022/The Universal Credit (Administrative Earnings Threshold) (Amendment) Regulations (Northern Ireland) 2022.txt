(This is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend regulation 97 of the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 216), which sets out the circumstances in which work search and work availability requirements may not be imposed on a universal credit claimant.
Regulation 97(14) is amended so that work search and work availability requirements may not be imposed where a claimant has monthly earnings from employment that are equal to, or more than, 12 hours per week at the national minimum wage rate as set out in regulation 4 of the National Minimum Wage Regulations 2015 (“the national living wage”) or, where the claimant is a member of a couple, their combined earnings from employment are equal to, or more than, 19 hours per week at the national living wage rate, in both cases converted to a monthly amount by multiplying by 52 and dividing by 12.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c.8) are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant impact on the private, public or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

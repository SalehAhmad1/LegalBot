(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made by the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland under the Pharmacy (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 amended by the Pharmacy (1976 Order) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2013. The Regulations set out matters relating to the requirement for practising pharmacists to have in operation an indemnity arrangement which provides appropriate cover and in relation to information to be provided to the registrar regarding such arrangements.
A person seeking to be registered (including on an application for restoration) or a practising pharmacist must declare in writing that they either have or will have by the time they begin to practise, an indemnity arrangement which provides appropriate cover (regulations 2 and 3).
The registrar may, at any time, require a practising pharmacist to submit to the registrar evidence that they have in operation an indemnity arrangement which provides appropriate cover. The registrar may also seek confirmation from a third party about indemnity arrangements in relation to that person (regulations 4 and 5).
A practising pharmacist must inform the registrar if for any reason they cease to have in operation an indemnity arrangement and must provide information relating to their indemnity arrangement at the request of any person who wishes to access their services (regulations 6 and 7).
Where a decision has been taken to refuse to retain a person’s name in or to remove a person’s name from the register, the decision does not take effect until the time for serving a Notice of Appeal has expired. Where a Notice of Appeal is served within time, the decision does not take effect until the date on which the appeal is finally disposed of, or is abandoned or fails by reason of its non-prosecution (regulation 8).
The Notice of Appeal must be served on the secretary of the Statutory Committee within 28 days of the written statement of the decision being sent by the registrar unless the secretary has extended the time limit for serving the Notice of Appeal (regulation 9). Regulations 14 to 29 of the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland (Continuing Professional Development) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2012 apply to an appeal under Article 11A(11) of the Pharmacy (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 (regulation 10).
These Regulations revoke and replace with minor amendments the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland (Indemnity Arrangements) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2014 (regulation 11).

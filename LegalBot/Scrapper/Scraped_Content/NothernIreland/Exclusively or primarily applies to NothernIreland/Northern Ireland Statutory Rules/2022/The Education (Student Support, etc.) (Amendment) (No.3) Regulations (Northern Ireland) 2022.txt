(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend legislation which makes provision about, or in connection with, student finance. Three sets of Student Support Regulations are amended. Those Regulations are the Education (Student Support) (No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 “the 2009 Regulations”, the Student Fees (Amounts) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 (“the 2005 Regulations”) and the Student Fees (Qualifying Courses and Persons) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 “the 2007 Regulations”.
Regulations 3 and 4 of these regulations amend the 2005 Regulations by increasing the basic and higher amounts prescribed in the 2005 Regulations. In each case the increases are by 1.8%, and will come into operation on 1st September 2023.
The 2005 Regulations prescribe the basic and higher amounts which higher education institutions in Northern Ireland may charge by way of tuition fees. Regulation 3 of the 2005 Regulations sets out the basic and higher amounts which ordinarily apply. Regulation 4 of the 2005 Regulations sets out the lower basic and higher amounts which apply in respect of an academic year of specified courses.
Regulations 5 and 6 amends the 2007 Regulations to correct an omission to ensure that those students studying for graduate entry courses are not discounted from Home Fee Status because of holding a previous honours degree.
Regulation 9 makes amendments to Schedule 6, to update the list of relevant institutions of higher education in the Republic of Ireland.
New payment rates (regulations 7, 8 and the Schedule)
The 2009 Regulations are amended to update the payment rates for student support for an academic year which begins on or after 1st August 2023 (regulations 7, 8 and the Schedule).
An impact assessment has not been produced for this rule as no, or no significant impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

Ms Heather Cousins
A senior officer of the Department for the EconomyEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Student Support) (No.2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 (S.R. 2009/373) (“the Student Support Regulations”) and the Student Fees (Qualifying Courses and Persons) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 (S.R. 2007/328).
The principal amendments which these Regulations make to the Student Support Regulations ensure that references continue to operate effectively following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 2 revokes regulations 2-13 of the Education (Student Fees and Support) (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 S.I. 2019/387 which were prepared for a “no-deal” EU Exit and do not reflect amendments required to implement the EU withdrawal agreement, EEA EFTA separation agreement and the Swiss citizens’ rights agreement.
Regulation 4 omits the definition of “right of permanent residence”, from regulation 2 of the Student Support Regulations. The term will be defined in Schedule 2 (see Regulation 12(a)(i)(bb)).
Regulations 6 and 13 amend references to “Member State” in provisions relating to the calculation of students’ income, to ensure that these references continue to operate effectively following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 12 amends definitions and references relating to the European Economic Area and the European Union which are used in Schedule 2 to the Student Support Regulations, to ensure that these definitions and references continue to operate effectively following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
Regulation 12(a)(i)(bb) inserts a new definition of “right of permanent residence” to reflect the fact that on and after IP completion day Directive 2004/38/EC (the “Directive”) will no longer have force in the UK and is replaced by rights under the EU withdrawal agreement, EEA EFTA separation agreement or Swiss citizens’ rights agreement, as implemented by the residence scheme immigration rules (as defined in section 17(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020).
Regulation 12(b)(i) amends paragraph 3 of Schedule 2. Students who have acquired the right of permanent residence under Article 15 of the EU withdrawal agreement or Article 14 of the EEA EFTA separation agreement or the Swiss citizens’ rights agreement but have not obtained settled status under the residence scheme immigration rules, must be treated as if they have acquired the right of permanent residence if they meet the requirements in Article 18(2) or (3) of the EU withdrawal agreement, Article 17(2) or (3) of the EEA EFTA separation agreement, or Article 16(2) or (3) of the Swiss citizens’ rights agreement. This amendment ensures that those students are eligible for student support on the same basis as if they had right of permanent residence.
Regulation 12(b)(iii) amends paragraph 7 of Part 2 of Schedule 2, which confers eligibility on the children of EEA workers. This regulation adds a new sub-paragraph (2) to paragraph 7, which provides that any description of person who would have been eligible under that paragraph immediately before IP completion day is to be eligible on and after IP completion day. Regulation 12(b)(v)(bb) also makes similar provision in relation to EU nationals and their family members, who, after IP completion day, may no longer fall within paragraph 9 of Part 2 of Schedule 2, and regulation 12(b)(vii)(cc) makes similar provision in relation to children of Swiss nationals who, after IP completion day, may no longer fall within paragraph 11 of that Schedule.
Regulation 12(b)(iv) amends paragraph 8 of Part 2 of Schedule 2. This paragraph covers students who have previously exercised free movement rights under the Directive, which ceases to have effect on IP completion day.
Regulations 5,8, 9, 10, and 11 are consequential on regulation 12 and amend regulations 18, 83, 106, 123, and 151 of the Student Support Regulations. Regulations 18, 83, 106, 123 and 151 stipulate that a student who becomes a family member of an EU national during the course of an academic year may qualify for support in respect of that academic year. The amendments made by regulations 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11 extend this position to a student who becomes a family member of a person who is eligible by virtue of the new provision in paragraph 9(4) of Part 2 of Schedule 2. This does not apply if the person in respect of whom the student is a family member is themselves only eligible as a family member. Regulations 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 amend regulations 18, 74, 83, 106, 123 and 151 of the Student Support Regulations, where they currently refer to a person acquiring the right of permanent residence so that they will instead refer to a student becoming a person described in paragraph 3(a) of Schedule 2 to reflect the amendment made in regulation 12(b)(i).
Regulation 14 makes similar provisions in relation to the Student Fees (Qualifying Courses and Persons) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 to regulation 12.

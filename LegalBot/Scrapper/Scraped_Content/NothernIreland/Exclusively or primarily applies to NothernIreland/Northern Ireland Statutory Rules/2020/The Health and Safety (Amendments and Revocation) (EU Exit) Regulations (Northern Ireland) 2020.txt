Department for the EconomyEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. They relate to categories of deficiencies in retained EU law specified in section 8(2)(b), (d) and (g) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16).
The Regulations revoke and replace the Health and Safety (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1377). They amend subordinate legislation in the field of health and safety.
An Impact Assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as they have no or minimal impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies. A copy of the Explanatory Memorandum is published alongside the Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.
In Great Britain the corresponding Regulations are the Health and Safety (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1370) as amended by the Health and Safety (Consequential Amendments) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020 (S.I. 2020/660).

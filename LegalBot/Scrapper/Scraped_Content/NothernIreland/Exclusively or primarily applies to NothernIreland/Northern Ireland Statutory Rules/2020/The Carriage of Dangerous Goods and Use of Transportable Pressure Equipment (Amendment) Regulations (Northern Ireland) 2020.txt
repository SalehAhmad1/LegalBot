Department for InfrastructureEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 (“the 2010 Regulations”) which impose requirements and prohibitions in relation to the carriage of dangerous goods by road and by rail and, in so far as they relate to safety advisers, by inland waterway.
Following the dissolution of the Department of the Environment (DoE) by the Departments Act (Northern Ireland) 2016, the Road Traffic and Vehicles and Waterways (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2019 replaced all references to DoE, a designated competent authority in the 2010 Regulations, with references to the Department for Infrastructure (DfI).
However those amendments overlooked the transfer, via the Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 2016, of some of the functions in this area for which the DoE had been responsible to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA).
Accordingly, these Regulations amend the 2010 Regulations to correct that error and to provide for DAERA’s role as competent authority in relation to the carriage of radioactive (ADR class 7) goods by road.

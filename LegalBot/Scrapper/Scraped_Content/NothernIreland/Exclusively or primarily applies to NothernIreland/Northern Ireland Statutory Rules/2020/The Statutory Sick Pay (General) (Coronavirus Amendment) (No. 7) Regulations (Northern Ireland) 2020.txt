(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1982 (S.R. 1982 No. 263).
Regulation 2(1) to (4) amends Schedule 1 to the 1982 Regulations to reflect changes to the self-isolation requirements where a person has symptoms of coronavirus, tests positive for coronavirus or is a household contact of a person who has coronavirus. These provisions ensure that people who have to self-isolate for these reasons are deemed to be incapable of work for the full period for which they have to isolate.
Regulation 2(5) allows relevant notifications to be given orally.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provisions in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.

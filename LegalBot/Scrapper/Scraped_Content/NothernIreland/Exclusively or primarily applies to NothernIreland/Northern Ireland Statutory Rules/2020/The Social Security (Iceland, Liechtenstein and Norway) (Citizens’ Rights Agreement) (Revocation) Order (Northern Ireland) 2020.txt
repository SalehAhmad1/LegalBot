18th December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Social Security (Iceland) (Liechtenstein) (Norway) (Citizens’ Rights Agreement) Order (Northern Ireland) 2019 (S.R. 2019 No. 211) (“the 2019 Order”) makes provision for the modification of certain social security legislation so as to give effect to the Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Iceland, the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Kingdom of Norway signed at London on 2nd April 2019. That Agreement was superseded by a further agreement (“the EEA Citizens’ Rights Agreement”) between those countries which was signed at London on 28th January 2020.
The EEA Citizens’ Rights Agreement is incorporated into United Kingdom law from IP completion day by section 7B of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16) (“the 2018 Act”). The 2019 Order is therefore revoked by Article 2 of this Order.
This instrument does not impose any costs on business, charities or the voluntary sector. A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared for this instrument as it only revokes an instrument which has been superseded by section 7B of the 2018 Act.

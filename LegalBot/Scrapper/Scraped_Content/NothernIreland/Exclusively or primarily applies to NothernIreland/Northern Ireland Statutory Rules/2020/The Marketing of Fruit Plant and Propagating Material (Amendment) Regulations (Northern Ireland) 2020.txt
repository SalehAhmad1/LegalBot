(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Marketing of Fruit Plant and Propagating Material Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2017 (S.R. 2017 No. 119), which implement Council Directive 2008/90/EC on the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production (O.J. No. L 267, 8.10.2008, p. 8), and Commission Implementing Directive 2014/96/EU on the requirements for the labelling, sealing and packaging of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production, falling within the scope of Council Directive 2008/90/EC (O.J. No. L 298, 16.10.2014, p. 12). These Regulations implement Commission Implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1813 (O.J. No. L 278, 30.10.2019, p. 7), which amends Directive 2014/96/EU as regards the colour and content of a supplier’s document.
Regulation 2 makes provision requiring a supplier’s document affixed to a CAC material in the form of a label to be yellow and reduces the information required in a supplier’s document. It also contains transitional provision.
The explanatory memorandum and transposition note in respect of these Regulations are published alongside the Regulations on www.legislation.gov.uk.

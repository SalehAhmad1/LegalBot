EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Order) 
This Order, made on the application of Northern Ireland Water Limited (“NI Water”), makes 
provision to meet a serious deficiency of supplies of water which exists or is threatened in the area 
served by Altnahinch Impounding Reservoir by reason of an exceptional shortage of rain. 
NI Water is authorised to impound and abstract water from Altnahinch Impounding Reservoir 
under abstraction licence numbered AIL/2007/0019. Under this licence, NI Water must maintain a 
compensation flow immediately downstream of the impoundment at all times into the River Bush, 
by means of a reservoir spill or controlled release. The maintained compensation flow rate must be 
a minimum of 3210 cubic metres per day. 
The effect of this Order is to temporarily reduce (for no longer than three months) the minimum 
residual flow which NI Water is required to allow to flow from the impoundment into the River 
Bush from 3210 to 1280 cubic metres per day. 
This is subject to the modification in Article 2 and the conditions in Article 3.

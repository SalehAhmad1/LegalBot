EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(This note is not part of the Order) 
This Order amends The Parking Places on Roads and Waiting Restrictions (Magherafelt) Order 
(Northern Ireland) 2018 (“the Order”) by replacing the description of a parking place on King 
Street; authorising a parking place on Church Street and prescribing the conditions under which it 
may be used and dividing a parking place on Rainey Street into two separate parking places. 
The Order also creates a no waiting at any time restriction (loading and unloading not permitted) 
on Greenvale Park. 
Vehicles are excepted from the conditions and restrictions in certain circumstances. 
A penalty charge (£90) is payable with respect to a vehicle in a contravention of the Order in 
accordance with The Traffic Management (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 and The Penalty Charges 
(Prescribed Amounts) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006. 
Traffic signs indicating the effect of this Order will in due course be placed on the roads.

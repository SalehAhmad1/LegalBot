Department for the EconomyEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Further Education (Student Support) (Eligibility) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2012 (S.R. 2012 No.306).
Regulation 2 revokes the Education (Student Fees and Support) (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (S.I. 2019/387) which were prepared for a “no-deal” Brexit and do not reflect amendments required to implement the EU withdrawal agreement, EEA EFTA separation agreement and the Swiss citizens’ rights agreement.
The principal amendments which these Regulations make to the Further Education (Student Support) (Eligibility) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2012 ensure that references continue to operate effectively following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.

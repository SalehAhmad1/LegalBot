Department of FinanceEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order.)
The Administration of Estates (Small Payments) Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 specifies a limit on the amount of property which is allowed, under certain statutory provisions, to be disposed of on death without the necessity for probate or other proof of title, or in pursuance of a nomination made by the deceased. That limit was increased to £10,000 by the Administration of Estates (Small Payments) (Increase of Limit) Order (Northern Ireland) 2004. The present Order, which revokes that Order, further increases the limit to £20,000. In doing so the Order also takes account of the repeal of certain statutory provisions in respect of which the limit was formerly specified.
By virtue of section 6(2) of the Administration of Estates (Small Payments) Act (Northern Ireland) 1967, this Order applies in relation to deaths occurring, or nominations affected, after the expiration of a period of one month beginning with the date on which the Order comes into operation.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends Schedule 1 to the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1982 (S.R. 1982 No. 263) to provide that a person is entitled to statutory sick pay if they -
(a)
have been notified that they are to undergo a surgical or other hospital procedure;
(b)
have been advised to stay at home for a period of up to 14 days prior to being admitted to hospital for that procedure; and
(c)
stay at home pursuant to that advice.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provisions in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations in view of the urgency required to provide additional financial support to those unable to work as a result of coronavirus.

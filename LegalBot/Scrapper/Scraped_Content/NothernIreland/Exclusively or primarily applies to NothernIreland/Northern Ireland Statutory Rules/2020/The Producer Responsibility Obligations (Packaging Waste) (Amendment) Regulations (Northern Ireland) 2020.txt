(This note is not part of these Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 (S.R. 2007 No. 198) (the “2007 Regulations”). The 2007 Regulations impose on producers the obligation to recover and recycle packaging waste in order to attain the recovery and recycling targets set out in Article 6(1) of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (OJ No L 365, 31.12.94, p10), as last amended by Directive (EU) 2018/852.
These Regulations replace the EU recovery and recycling targets, in accordance with Directive (EU) 2018/852, with a recycling obligation on producers. They also establish new material specific recycling targets on obligated producers for paper/board, plastic, glass, aluminium, steel and wood as well as the specific re-melt target for glass. The recycling allocation for small producers for 2018 to 2020 is changed for 2021 and 2022.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this Rule will have on costs to business and the voluntary sector is available from the Producer Responsibility Unit at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Seacole Building, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DF and is published with the Explanatory Memorandum alongside this Rule on  www.legislation.gov.uk.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in exercise of the powers in paragraph 1(1) of Schedule 2 and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies (in particular under section 8(2)(a) to (g) of that Act) arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Electricity and Gas etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (“the EU Exit Regulations”) amended the Gas (Northern Ireland Order) 1996 (“the Gas Order”) for the same purpose. Regulation 3 amends the EU Exit Regulations to take into account subsequent amendments to the Gas Order made by the Gas (Internal Markets) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (“the 2020 Regulations”) to ensure that the Gas Order complied with the requirements of European Parliament and Council Directive 2009/73/EC as that Directive was amended by European Parliament and Council Directive 2019/692. In particular, regulation 118 of the EU Exit Regulations inserts a new Article 10A into the Gas Order with effect from IP completion day and regulation 3 amends the new Article 10A so to take account of amendments made by the 2020 Regulations and ensure that they operate effectively after that day.
Regulation 4 addresses other deficiencies and inoperabilities arising in the Gas Order as a result of other amendments made by the 2020 Regulations.
Regulation 5 revokes certain provisions in the 2020 Regulations which are spent with effect from IP completion day.

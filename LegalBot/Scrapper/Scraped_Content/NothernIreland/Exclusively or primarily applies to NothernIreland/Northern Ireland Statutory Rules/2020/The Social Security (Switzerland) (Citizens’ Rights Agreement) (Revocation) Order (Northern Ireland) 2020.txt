18th December 2020EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
The Social Security (Switzerland) (Citizens’ Rights Agreement) Order (Northern Ireland) 2019 (S. R. 2019 No. 212) (“the 2019 Order”) makes provision for the modification of certain social security legislation so as to give effect to the Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Swiss Confederation on Citizens’ Rights (“the Switzerland Citizens’ Rights Agreement”) following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the Free Movement of Persons Agreement, signed at Bern on 25th February 2019.
The 2019 Order was to have come into operation on IP completion day. Because the Switzerland Citizens’ Rights Agreement is incorporated into United Kingdom law from that day by section 7B of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c.16),(“the 2018 Act”) it is necessary for the 2019 Order to be revoked by Article 2 of this Order.
This instrument does not impose any costs on business, charities or the voluntary sector. A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared for this instrument as it only revokes an instrument which has been superseded by section 7B of the 2018 Act.

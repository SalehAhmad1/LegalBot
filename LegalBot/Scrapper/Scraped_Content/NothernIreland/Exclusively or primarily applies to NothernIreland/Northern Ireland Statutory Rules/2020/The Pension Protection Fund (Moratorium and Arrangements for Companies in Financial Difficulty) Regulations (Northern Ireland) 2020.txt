(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations, in certain circumstances, give the Board of the Pension Protection Fund (“the Board”) rights that are normally exercised by a pension scheme’s trustees or managers where they are creditors. Where the trustees or managers lose their rights as a result the Board is required to consult with them.
Regulation 2 applies when a moratorium under Part 1A of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 is or has been in force in relation to a company, limited liability partnership or relevant co-operative society or community benefit society which is, or has been at some point while the moratorium has been in force, an employer in respect of an eligible pension scheme. It gives the Board the right, instead of the trustees or managers, to participate in decisions as to whether to extend the moratorium and decisions in relation to a challenge to the directors’ actions. The Board must consult the trustees or managers before exercising those rights.

(This note is not part of the Order)
These Rules amend the Insolvency Rules (Northern Ireland) 1991. Rule 5A.14 of those Rules lists property the official receiver must disregard for the purposes of determining the value of a debtor’s property in connection with a debt relief order under Part 7A of the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. This includes a single domestic motor vehicle whose maximum potential realisable value is less than £1,000. These Rules change that amount to £2,000.
The effect which this instrument will have on business and voluntary bodies was considered as part of a regulatory impact assessment prepared for changes to all four financial eligibility limits for the debt relief scheme, which is available from the Insolvency Service, Fermanagh House, Ormeau Avenue, Belfast, BT2 8NJ, and is also published on the Department for the Economy website

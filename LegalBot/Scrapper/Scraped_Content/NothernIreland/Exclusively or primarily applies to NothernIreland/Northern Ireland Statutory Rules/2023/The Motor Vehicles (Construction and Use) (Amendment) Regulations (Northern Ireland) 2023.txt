(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Motor Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999 in order to make provision regarding the age of tyres (including retreaded tyres), and the legibility of date markings on tyres, which are permitted for use on buses (including minibuses) and goods vehicles with a maximum gross weight exceeding 3,500 kg. The Regulations also amend Table 2 of Schedule 1 to the 1999 Regulations to include provisions relating to retreaded tyres in ECE Regulations 108 and 109. These Regulations provide for an exemption for vehicles of historic interest provided they are not used for commercial purposes.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations modify the Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 (S.R. 2000 No. 91) to provide for a temporary increase in winter fuel payments for the 2023-24 winter.
These Regulations also revoke the Social Fund Winter Fuel Payment (Temporary Increase) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022 (S.R. 2022. No.215), which provided for an increase in payments for the 2022-23 winter.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992, are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.

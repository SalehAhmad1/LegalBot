(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Public Service Pensions Act (Northern Ireland) 2014 (c. 2) (“the 2014 Act”) makes provision, and confers powers to make further provision (in the form of “scheme regulations” as defined in section 1 of the 2014 Act), about the establishment of public service pension schemes. The Police Pensions Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015 (S.R. 2015 No. 113) (“the 2015 Regulations”) are the scheme regulations establishing the successor police pension scheme (“the reformed scheme”) to the schemes established by the Royal Ulster Constabulary Pensions Regulations 1988 (S.R. 1988 No. 374) and the Police Pension (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2009 (S.R. 2009 No. 79) (“the legacy schemes”). The 2015 Regulations provided for transitional protection for certain cohorts of legacy scheme members. Transitional protection of this sort was subsequently found to unlawfully discriminate between legacy scheme members on the basis of age.
The Public Service Pensions and Judicial Offices Act 2022 (c. 7) (“PSPJOA 2022”), at Chapter 1, makes provision, and confers powers for scheme regulations under the 2014 Act to make further provision, in relation to specified service (“remediable service” as defined in section 1 of PSPJOA 2022) of members who benefitted from transitional protection, and of members who did not benefit from transitional protection only by reason of their age. Section 27 of PSPJOA 2022 requires certain powers to make scheme regulations to be exercised in accordance with Treasury directions (section 38(1) confirms that this includes Directions made by the Department of Finance for public sector pension schemes in Northern Ireland).
These Regulations are scheme regulations under the 2014 Act and in accordance with PSPJOA 2022 in relation to a member’s remediable service in a police pension scheme. They are, to the extent required by section 27 of PSPJOA 2022, made in accordance with Treasury directions under that section (in the form of the Public Service Pensions (Exercise of Powers, Compensation and Information) Directions 2022). These Regulations have retrospective effect, which is authorised by section 3(3)(b) of the 2014 Act.
Part 2 of these Regulations makes provision about when and to whom a remediable service statement is to be provided by the scheme manager, as well as the contents of the remediable service statement.
Part 3 makes provision about the principal decisions that may be made in relation to a member’s remediable service—
(a)
Chapter 1 makes provision about when and how an election may be made for service in respect of which a member opted-out of a police pension scheme to be reinstated and treated as remediable service;
(b)
Chapter 2 makes provision about when and how a decision may be made, or be deemed to have been made, about whether the remediable service of a pensioner or deceased member (an “immediate choice member”) is to be treated as service in the member’s legacy scheme or in the reformed scheme;
(c)
Chapter 3 makes provision similar to Chapter 2, but in relation to the remediable service of an active or deferred member (a “deferred choice member”).
Part 4 makes provision about cases in which the pension rights secured by virtue of a member’s remediable service are at issue in proceedings relating to the member’s separation from a spouse or civil partner—
(a)
Chapter 1 makes provision about sharing the value of such rights under a pension sharing order where they are subject to a pension debit under Article 26 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 (S.I./1999 No. 3147) (N.I. 11). It provides, in particular, for the calculation or, where appropriate, the re-calculation of the value of a pension debit and a pension credit in relation to the rights;
(b)
Chapter 2 makes provision about the calculation of the value of rights for the purposes of sharing those rights under an arrangement other than a pension sharing order.
Part 5 makes provision about lump sum voluntary contributions paid by a member during the period of their remediable service, and periodical contributions paid by a member under an arrangement which commenced during the period of their remediable service, to secure further pension rights—
(a)
regulation 27 makes provision under which compensation is to be paid in relation to voluntary contributions used to secure rights to reformed scheme added pension during the period of their remediable service;
(b)
regulation 28 makes provision under which compensation is to be paid in relation to voluntary contributions used to secure rights legacy scheme added years during the period of their remediable service where the benefits to be paid in relation to a member’s remediable service are reformed scheme benefits;
(c)
regulation 29 makes provision under which a member who has remediable service in the reformed scheme may elect to enter into a retrospective arrangement to secure added years in the member’s legacy scheme in respect of that remediable service.
Part 6 makes provision about transfers in and out of a police pension scheme of pension rights during the period of a member’s remediable service—
(a)
Chapter 1 makes provision about, among other things, the provision of a remediable service statement to a person who has transferred out rights in respect of remediable service and in respect of whom a remediable service statement is not otherwise required to be provided;
(b)
Chapter 2 makes provision about transfers in and out of a police pension scheme on a cash equivalent basis, including provision about the calculation (and, where appropriate, the recalculation) of the value of a cash equivalent transfer value, and the making and accepting of payments in relation to the transfer value of rights secured by virtue of remediable service;
(c)
Chapter 3 makes provision similar to Chapter 2, but in relation to transfers in and out of a police pension scheme on a club basis;
(d)
Chapter 4 makes provision for—
(i)
transfers into the reformed scheme in respect of rights secured by virtue of remediable service to be treated as being transferred into the member’s legacy scheme where the benefits which become payable in respect of the member’s remediable service are legacy scheme benefits;
(ii)
the conferring or variation of rights in a member’s legacy scheme to reflect a change in the value of those rights by virtue of PSPJOA 2022 and these Regulations;
(iii)
financial corrections of any pension benefits paid in respect of the transferred-in rights of an immediate choice member.
Part 7 makes provision about special cases—
(a)
Chapter 1 makes provision about ill-health retirement—
(i)
regulation 50 makes provision about the cases in which a member who met the requirements for an ill-health retirement award in one police pension scheme is to be deemed as meeting the requirements in their alternative police pension scheme;
(ii)
regulation 51 makes provision under which a member who has received an ill-health retirement award under the Royal Ulster Constabulary Pensions Regulations 1988 is to be assessed for eligibility for an upper tier award in the reformed scheme.
(b)
Chapter 2 makes provision about —
(i)
protecting the amount of any child pension which is already in payment so that it will not be reduced as a result of PSPJOA 2022 or these Regulations;
(ii)
the payment of annual allowance tax charges;
(iii)
revisiting decisions about whether or not to elect for non-pensionable pay instead of temporary pay.
Part 8 makes provision cases in which a person has already obtained a remedy in relation to their remediable service. Such persons are treated for the purposes of PSPJOA 2022 and these Regulations as if they were an immediate choice member who has elected to receive legacy scheme benefits in relation to their remediable service.
Part 9 makes provision about any amounts (“relevant amounts”) owed to or by a person as a result of PSPJOA 2022 or these Regulations—
(a)

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke the Guardians Ad Litem (Panel) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1996.
Article 60(7) and (9) of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 and Article 66A(1) and (2) of the Adoption (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 empower the Department of Health by way of regulations to provide for the establishment of panels of persons from whom guardians ad litem must be selected. Such Panel arrangements are now no longer in operation or required and, as a result, the Regulations are no longer necessary and are being revoked.

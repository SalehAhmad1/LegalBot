This Order permits the Ulster Automobile Club Ltd, as promoter of the Circuit of Ireland Rally

In effect this Order temporarily closes these roads. 
This Order requires the promoter to give public notice of the promoter’s intended use of these

resulting from the event. 
It is an offence for any person— 
(a) to obstruct or interfere wilfully and unlawfully with the conduct of the event; 
(b) to obstruct any constable acting in the course of that constable’s duty or any marshal or 
any other person exercising any function conferred on that person; 
(c) to enter or remain without authority on any road closed for the event; 
(d) to keep any animal or any vehicle without lawful authority on any specified road; or 
(e) to contravene wilfully any provision of a road closing Order or any traffic direction given 
by the police for the purposes of the event.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations enable the Department to amend Regulation S.R. 2022 No. 240 – The Direct Payments to Farmers (Cross-Compliance) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022 to include schemes for direct payment to farmers made under retained Regulation (EU) No. 1305/2013.
Regulation 4 amends retained Commission Regulation (EU) 809/2014 to remove the requirement to increase the number of on-the-spot-checks for any act or standard revealing significant degree of non-compliance.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

The Department has published a notice in compliance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of that Schedule.

appear to the Department reasonably practicable for the purpose of bringing specifically to the 
knowledge of the occupiers of land adjacent to the parking places the particulars specified in

No objection or other representation has been received.

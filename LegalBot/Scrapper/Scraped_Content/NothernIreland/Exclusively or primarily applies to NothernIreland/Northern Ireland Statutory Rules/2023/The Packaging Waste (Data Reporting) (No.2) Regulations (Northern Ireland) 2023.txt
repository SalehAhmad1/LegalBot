(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations impose requirements on producers who are established in Northern Ireland to collect data on the packaging they supply to others, and, in some cases, to report some of that information to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.
Part 1 (regulations 1 to 15) contains the interpretation and general provisions for the rule. Part 2 (regulations 16 to 19) sets out the obligations on producers. Schedule 1 identifies the information which producers are required to collect and report on. Part 3 (regulations 20 to 22) makes provision for registered schemes and exempts producers who are members of a registered scheme from their data reporting obligations under these Regulations provided that they satisfy the requirements in regulation 20(2). Registered schemes are required to make reports on behalf of each of their members who satisfy these requirements. Part 3 also makes provision in relation to changes to the membership of a scheme in the middle of a relevant year.
Part 4 (regulations 23 to 27) sets out the powers and duties of the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs under these Regulations.
Part 5 (regulation 28) revokes the Packaging Waste (Data Reporting) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2023.
A full impact assessment of the effect that this instrument will have on the costs of business, the voluntary sector and the public sector is available from www.legislation.gov.uk and from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, Klondyke Building, Cromac Avenue, Gasworks Business Park, Malone Lower, Belfast BT7 2JA.

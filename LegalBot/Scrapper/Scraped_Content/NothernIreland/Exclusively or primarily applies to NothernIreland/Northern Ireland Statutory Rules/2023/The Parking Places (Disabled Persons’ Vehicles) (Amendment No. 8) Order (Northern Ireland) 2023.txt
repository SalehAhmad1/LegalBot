conferred by Articles 10(4), 13(1) and (16) of, and paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 to, the Road Traffic 
Regulation (Northern Ireland) Order 1997(b) and now vested in it(c).

The Department has published a notice in compliance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of that Schedule. 
The Department in compliance with paragraph 3(4) of that Schedule, has taken such other steps as 
appear to the Department reasonably practicable for the purpose of bringing specifically to the 
knowledge of the occupiers of land adjacent to the parking places the particulars specified in 
paragraph 3(2) of that Schedule. 
Two objections have been received and one has subsequently been withdrawn.  No other 
representation has been received.

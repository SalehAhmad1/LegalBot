(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Article 4(12) of the 2005 Order enables the Department to specify an index of prices to which it must have regard in deciding whether any increase in the basic and higher tuition fee amounts is no greater than required to maintain the value of the amounts in real terms as specified under.
These Regulations set out that index.
The index is published by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The basic and higher tuition fee amounts are prescribed by the Student Fees (Amounts) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 S.R.2005 No.290.
A Section 75 assessment is not required as there is no change to existing policy.

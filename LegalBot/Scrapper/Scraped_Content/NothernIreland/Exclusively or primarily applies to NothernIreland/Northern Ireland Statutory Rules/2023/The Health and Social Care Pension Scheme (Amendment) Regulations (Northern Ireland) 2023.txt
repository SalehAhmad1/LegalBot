Department of FinanceEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health and Personal Social Services (Superannuation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1995 (S.R 1995 No.95) (“the 1995 Regulations”), Health and Social Care (Pension Scheme) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008 (S.R. 2008 No.256) (“the 2008 regulations”), Health and Social Care Pension Scheme Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015 (S.R. 2015 No.120) (“the 2015 Regulations”).
Part 1 provides for citation, commencement and effect, including that some provisions of this rule are to take effect retrospectively. Article 14(1) of the Superannuation (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 and section 3(3) of the Public Service Pensions Act (Northern Ireland) 2014 provide authority for these regulations to take effect as a date earlier than the making of these Regulations.
Parts 2 and 3 make amendments to the 1995 Regulations and the 2008 Regulations, by including income from shared parental leave within pensionable pay.
Part 4 similarly amends the 2015 Regulations in relation to shared parental leave. It also amends these regulations to update the member contribution tiers in line with the AfC pay award and to make technical amendments in relation to the calculation of the index adjustment of member balances.
Part 5 makes temporary technical amendments in relation to the calculation of practitioner contribution rates paid by members.
Part 6 removes references to the Regional Health and Social Care Board (which ceased to exist from 1 April 2022) and replaces these with references to the Department.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Licensing (Form of Licence) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1997, to take account of changes required to the form of licence as a result of provisions within the Licensing and Registration of Clubs (Amendment) Act (Northern Ireland) 2021. The relevant provisions authorise underage functions in specified licensed premises, further later opening for public houses and hotels, and the retail sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor in a local producer’s premises under the Licensing (Northern Ireland) Order 1996.
These Regulations also remove references relating to provisions which removed additional restrictions on Good Friday, Easter Day and late night permitted hours on a Sunday.

A senior officer of the Department for CommunitiesEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations modify the Housing Benefit (Executive Determinations) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2008 (S.R. 2008 No. 100) and the Universal Credit Housing Costs (Executive Determinations) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 222) to make changes to how the local housing allowance is determined.
Regulations 2 and 3 modify the above Regulations to provide that, for all broad rental market areas, the local housing allowance for any category of dwelling or accommodation is the allowance determined for that category of dwelling or accommodation on 31st March 2020. The modification will apply for those purposes of determining local housing allowances in 2023.
The allowances were set by regulation 4 of the Social Security (Coronavirus) (Further Measures) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (S.R. 2020 No. 53). These figures have subsequently been maintained, at the same rate, by the Housing Benefit and Universal Credit Housing Costs (Executive Determinations) (Modification) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (S.R. 2021 No. 14) and the Housing Benefit and Universal Credit Housing Costs (Executive Determinations) (Amendment and Modification) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2022 (S.R. 2022 No. 15).
A full impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

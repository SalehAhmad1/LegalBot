Minister of HealthEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 to introduce provisions regarding the requirement to show proof of COVID-status Certification to gain entry into relevant settings. The accepted evidence is proof of full vaccination, the last dose of which was received at least 14 days prior to the relevant time, a negative COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test, taken within the previous 48 hours or proof of recovery from a positive COVID-19 PCR test, within the previous 30-180 days.
A minor amendment has been also been made to align the definition of a rave with that of a house party.
No regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

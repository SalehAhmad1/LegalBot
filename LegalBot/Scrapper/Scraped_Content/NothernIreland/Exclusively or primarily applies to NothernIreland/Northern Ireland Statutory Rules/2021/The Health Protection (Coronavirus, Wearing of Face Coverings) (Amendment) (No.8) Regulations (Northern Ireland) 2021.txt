A senior officer of the Department of HealthEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Wearing of Face Coverings) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 by amending the list of reasonable excuses to not wear a face covering by removing severe distress, placing the onus on an individual to prove their exemption and to place a statutory duty on businesses to promote compliance with face covering regulations by ensuring all reasonable measures are in place. They also remove the requirement to wear a face covering when on a transport service premises where area is outdoors and make a minor amendment to the requirement to wear on a ferry.
No regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the Misuse of Drugs (Designation) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001 (S.R. 2001 No. 431) (“the Order”).
Section 7(3) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (c. 38) (“the 1971 Act”) requires regulations to be made to allow the use for certain purposes, including medical use, of the drugs which are subject to control under that Act. Section 7(4)(b) of the 1971 Act provides, however, that designated controlled drugs will be exempt from this easement and so cannot lawfully be prescribed, administered, produced, compounded or supplied except under licence or other authority issued by the Department of Health. The designations in question are in the Misuse of Drugs (Designation) Order (Northern Ireland) 2001 (“the Order”). Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Order is amended by adding flualprazolam, flunitrazolam and norfludiazepam to that Part (which specifies controlled drugs to which section 7(4) of the 1971 Act applies).
The Misuse of Drugs (Designation) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 are revoked.

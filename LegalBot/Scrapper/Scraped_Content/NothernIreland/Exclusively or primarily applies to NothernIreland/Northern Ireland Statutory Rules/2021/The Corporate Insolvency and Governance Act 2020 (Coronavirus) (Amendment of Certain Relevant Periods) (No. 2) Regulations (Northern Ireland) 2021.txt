(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations extend the periods (referred to as the “relevant periods”) during which certain provisions in the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“the Act”) that make temporary modifications to the law concerning winding up petitions to mitigate the effects of coronavirus are to have effect.
The Act originally provided that these relevant periods were to expire on 30 September 2020. The periods have since been extended on three occasions: by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Amendment of Certain Relevant Periods) Regulations (Northern Ireland 2020 (S.R 2020 No. 199), by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Amendment of Certain Relevant Periods) (No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (S.R. 2020 No. 321) and by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (Coronavirus) (Amendment of Certain Relevant Periods) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (S.R. 2021 No. 75). The last of these extended the relevant periods until the 30 June 2021.
Regulation 2 of these Regulations further extends the relevant periods until 30 September 2021.

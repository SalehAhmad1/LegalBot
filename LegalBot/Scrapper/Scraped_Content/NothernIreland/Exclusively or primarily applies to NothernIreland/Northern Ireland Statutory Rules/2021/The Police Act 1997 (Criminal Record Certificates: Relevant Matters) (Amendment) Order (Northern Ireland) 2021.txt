Minister of JusticeEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order amends the definition of “relevant matter” in the Police Act 1997. The definition of “relevant matter” sets out what information is disclosed by AccessNI in response to an application for a criminal record certificate or an enhanced criminal record certificate. The Order provides for the amendment of a scheme to filter out certain convictions that are old and minor and certain disposals from disclosure on a criminal record certificate or an enhanced criminal record certificate. Specifically, this Order removes the previous requirement whereby AccessNI could not filter any convictions that might be otherwise eligible for filtering except for the fact that an applicant had more than one conviction.

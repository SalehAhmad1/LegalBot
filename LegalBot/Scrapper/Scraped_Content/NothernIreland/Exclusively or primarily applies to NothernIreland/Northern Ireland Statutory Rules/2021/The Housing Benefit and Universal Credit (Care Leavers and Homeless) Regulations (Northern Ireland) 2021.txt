(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Housing Benefit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 (“the Housing Benefit Regulations”) and the Universal Credit Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (“the Universal Credit Regulations”). They extend the age ranges of the exemptions from the shared accommodation rate of the Local Housing Allowance which apply to care leavers and those who have spent at least 3 months in a homeless hostel whilst receiving support to assist with community resettlement or rehabilitation.
Regulation 2 amends the definition of “young individual” in regulation 2(1) of the Housing Benefit Regulations, insofar as it applies to care leavers, increasing the upper age limit at which individuals can be exempted from the shared accommodation rate from 22 to 25 years. It also reduces the lower age limit to qualify for the exemption from 25 to 16 years for those who have spent at least 3 months in a homeless hostel whilst receiving support to assist with community resettlement or rehabilitation. Regulation 2 also maintains the lower age limit to access the exemption at 25 years for those that are the subject of active multi-agency management pursuant to arrangements established under the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (S.I. 2008/1216 (N.I. 1)).
Regulation 3 amends paragraph 28 of Schedule 4 to the Universal Credit Regulations to increase similarly the upper age limit at which care leavers are exempted from the shared accommodation rate from 22 to 25 years. It also reduces the lower age limit to qualify for the exemption from 25 to 16 years for those who have spent at least 3 months in a homeless hostel whilst receiving support to assist with community resettlement or rehabilitation.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.

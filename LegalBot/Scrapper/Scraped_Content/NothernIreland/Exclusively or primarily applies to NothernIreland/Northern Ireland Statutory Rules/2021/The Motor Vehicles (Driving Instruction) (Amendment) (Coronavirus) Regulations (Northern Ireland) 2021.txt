(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Motor Vehicles (Driving Instruction) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2010 (“the 2010 Regulations”) in order to extend, in certain circumstances, the length of time that a person has to apply for the instructional ability and fitness test after passing the driving instructor theory test given the suspension of practical driver testing due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) public health emergency.
Regulation 7 of the 2010 Regulations provides that a person taking the examination to be an approved driving or motorcycle instructor must apply to take the instructional ability and fitness test within two years after passing the theory test and having passed the driving ability and fitness test or the riding ability and fitness test, as the case may be. These regulations amend regulation 7 in order to allow a person to apply for the instructional ability and fitness test within three years after passing the theory test and having passed the driving ability and fitness test or the riding ability and fitness test, as the case may be, where the two year period would have expired or would expire between 31st May 2020 and 31st August 2021.

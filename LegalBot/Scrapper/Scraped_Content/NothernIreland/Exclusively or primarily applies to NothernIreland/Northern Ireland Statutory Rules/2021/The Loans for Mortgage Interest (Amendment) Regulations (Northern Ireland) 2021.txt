(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 amends the Loans for Mortgage Interest Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2017 to clarify that claimants who have fled the accommodation for which they receive support for mortgage interest loan payments due to fear of violence in the home will be able to continue receiving loan payments for that accommodation for a specified period of time.
Regulation 3 amends the Social Fund (Cold Weather Payments) (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1988 to clarify which conditions a claimant who receives support for mortgage interest loan payments and is treated as entitled to state pension credit needs to meet in order to be entitled to a cold weather payment.
These Regulations make in relation to Northern Ireland only provision corresponding to provision contained in Regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 to remove the limit on the number of people who can attend an indoor gathering at a private dwelling, provided it is not a large house party or rave, remove the maximum number who can stay overnight at tourist accommodation and remove the requirement to be seated at an indoor performance, recording or rehearsal. It also amends the requirements for Visitor and Attendee Information to be recorded.
No regulatory impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

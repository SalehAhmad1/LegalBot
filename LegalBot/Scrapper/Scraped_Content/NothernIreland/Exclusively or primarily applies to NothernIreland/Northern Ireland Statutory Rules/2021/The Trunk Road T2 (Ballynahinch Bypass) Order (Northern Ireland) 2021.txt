The Department for Infrastructure in accordance with Article 14(1) of the Roads (Northern 
Ireland) Order 1993 considers it expedient for the purpose of improving the trunk system that the 
road proposed to be constructed on the route described in Part 1 of the Schedule should be 
designated as trunk road. 
The Department in accordance with Article 68(4) of that Order proposes on completion of works 
providing alternative facilities for road traffic to: 
(a) stop-up the roads described in Part 2 of the Schedule to road traffic; 
(b) abandon the length of roads described in Part 3 of the Schedule; and 
(c) stop-up the road described in Part 4 of the Schedule to motor vehicles. 
The Department makes the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 14(1) 
and 68(1), (3) and (5) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993(a) and now vested in it (b). 
Notice of the proposed Order has been published, served and displayed in accordance with 
paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 8 to the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993. 
A total of 23 objections were received by the Department prior to the closing date and the 
Department considered the objections.  
The Department having caused a local inquiry to be held into the objections that were made and 
not withdrawn and having considered the report of the inquiry, now proposes to make the Order 
with modifications.

(This note is not part of the Rules)
The Criminal Justice (Sentencing) (Licence Conditions) (Northern Ireland) Rules 2009 (the “2009 Rules”) prescribe the standard and other conditions which may be contained in a licence issued under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. The Probation Board for Northern Ireland currently retains sole responsibility for supervising offenders released into the community under such licence.
These Rules amend the 2009 Rules to assign supervisory responsibility for licensees to a “supervising officer”. The term “supervising officer” is defined as “a probation officer or such other person or organisation for the time being responsible for supervising specific offenders on licence in accordance with arrangements made by the Department of Justice”. This amendment gives the Department of Justice discretion to assign supervisory responsibility to other persons or organisations where it is considered that they are better placed to give effect to the purpose of a licence.

Minister of HealthEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Part 1 of these Regulations amends the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2020 (S.R. 2020 No. 90) to introduce a requirement for persons travelling to Northern Ireland from outside the open borders area comprising the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland (the “common travel area” by virtue of section 1(3) of the Immigration Act 1971 (c. 77)) to possess a notification of a negative coronavirus test upon arrival in Northern Ireland.
Part 2 of these Regulations introduces requirements for persons operating commercial transport services (“operators”) for passengers travelling to Northern Ireland from outside the common travel area to ensure that passengers who arrive in Northern Ireland on such services have completed a Passenger Locator Form (regulation 6(1)) and possess notification of a negative test result (regulation 7(1)). Breach of the requirements is an offence (regulation 8(1)).
Upon completion of the Passenger Locator Form, passengers receive a unique passenger reference number from the Home Office. An operator who has recorded a unique passenger reference number in the format used by the Home Office will have a defence to the offence in regulation 8(1)(a) (regulation 8(3)).
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (“the Principal Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Operator Liability and Information to Passengers) Regulations 2021.
Regulation 2 introduces a revised definition of self-isolation to describe the context that it relates to.
Regulation 3 create the new category of amber plus list countries. If a fully vaccinated traveller arrives from an amber plus list country, they are not treated as if they had arrived from a green list country.
Regulation 4 amends and expands the fully vaccinated traveller exemption so that travellers who are fully vaccinated in the EU or USA, and who arrive in Northern Ireland from an amber list country are treated as if they had arrived from a green list country.
Regulations 5, 6, 7 and 8 establish a workforce test regime for certain categories of arrivals to Northern Ireland. Those arrivals must now undertake workforce tests after arrival.
Regulation 9 adds the requirement for operators to ensure that a passenger provides evidence of relevant vaccination.
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

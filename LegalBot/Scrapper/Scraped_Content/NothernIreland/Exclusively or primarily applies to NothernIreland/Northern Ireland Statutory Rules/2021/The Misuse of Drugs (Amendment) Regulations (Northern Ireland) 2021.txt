(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Misuse of Drugs Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002 (S.R. 2002 No. 1) (“the Regulations”).
Regulation 2 adds three benzodiazepines, being the compounds known as flualprazolam, flunitrazolam and norfludiazepam, to Schedule 1 to the Regulations. The Schedule of the Regulations in which a controlled drug is placed affects the extent to which the drug can be lawfully imported, exported, produced, supplied or possessed. The controlled drugs placed in Schedule 1 to the Regulations are those subject to the tightest controls, requiring a licence from the Department of Health in order to access such drugs.

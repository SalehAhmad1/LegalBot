(This note is not part of the Order)
These Regulations amend Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (S.R. 2021 No.99) (“the principal Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Operator Liability and Information to Passengers) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (S.R. 2021 No. 102) (“the Operator Liability Regulations”).
Regulation 3 amends the principal Regulations to enable the EU Digital Covid Certificate to provide proof of a negative pre-departure test.
Regulations 4 and 5 amend the principal Regulations to remove countries from Schedule 1, Red list countries and adds to the list of countries which are “relevant countries” meaning that persons who receive vaccines in those countries can count as an “eligible arrival” for the purposes of the principal Regulations.
Regulation 6 amends Schedule 4 of the principal Regulations to introduce new exempt categories: non-UK police officers, who can self-isolate if coming from a red-list country (rather than entering managed quarantine service) and can claim an exemption from self-isolation when undertaking the exempt activity; and Seasonal poultry workers, who can claim an exemption from self-isolation when undertaking the exempt activity.
Regulation 6 also makes technical amendments to existing exemptions in Schedule 4 in relation to the film and high end TV productions exemption to widen the existing exemption and reinstate the system in place during 2020, and to amend the exemption for Diplomats and members of their family, removing the requirement to self-isolate.
Regulation 7 amends the Operator Liability Regulations to include the EU Digital Covid Certificate as a means of providing proof of negative pre-departure test status.

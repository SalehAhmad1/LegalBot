Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural AffairsEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs publishes a charging scheme to ensure that as far as practical, fees and charges payable for waste management licences under the Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 (the 1997 Order) are sufficient to recover the costs for the Department in exercising its functions under the 1997 Order. However, fees for processing applications to register an undertaking carrying on an exempt activity and charges for processing applications for registration as carriers, brokers, or dealers in controlled waste are required to be set out in legislation. The purpose of these Regulations is to increase those fees and charges. Details of the increased fees will also be included in the charging scheme which sets out the fees and charges payable in respect to waste management licences.
These Regulations amend regulation 4 of the Controlled Waste (Registration of Carriers and Seizure of Vehicles) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999. Which sets out the process concerning applications for registration as a carrier of controlled waste, including the associated fees.
Also amended is regulation 18(12) of the Waste Management Licensing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003, which sets out fees in relation to registration of an undertaking or establishment carrying out activities exempted from the requirement to obtain a full waste management licence and paragraph 3(10) of Schedule 4 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003 which sets out fees in relation to the registration of brokers of and dealers in controlled waste.

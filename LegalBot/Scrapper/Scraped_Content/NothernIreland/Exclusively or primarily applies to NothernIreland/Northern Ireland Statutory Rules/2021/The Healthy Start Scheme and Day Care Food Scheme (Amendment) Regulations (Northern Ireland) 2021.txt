Department of HealthEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
These Regulations amend the Healthy Start Scheme and Day Care Food Scheme Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 (S.R. 2006 No. 478) (“the Principal Regulations”).
Part 2 makes amendments to the principal Regulations.
Regulations 3 to 18 amend the principal Regulations. The principal Regulations establish a scheme to improve nutrition in pregnant women, mothers and young children by providing for vouchers to be issued to beneficiaries to enable the purchase of certain basic food and vitamins (“the scheme”). These Regulations make amendments to the principal Regulations to provide for the digitisation of the scheme. This includes the gradual replacement of paper vouchers with vouchers in electronic form or in the form of a pre-paid payment card and removal of the requirement to provide evidence in writing, signed by a health professional, of the estimated date of delivery of the pregnant woman. In addition, regulation 17 expands the definition of ‘Healthy Start food’ (which may be purchased with vouchers) to include pulses and canned fruit and vegetables.
Regulation 19 amends Part VII. Part VII provides for a scheme (“the Day Care Food Scheme”) which entitles children under the age of five years to free milk where they are looked after, or provided with day care, by an approved day care provider, for two hours or more. Regulation 19 substitutes the definition of ‘infant formula’ so that a greater variety of dried milk, which are not limited to certain brands, may be provided to children under the nursery milk scheme.
Part 3 makes transitional provisions.
An impact assessment has not been prepared for this rule as no, or no significant, impact on the private or voluntary sector is foreseen.

The Department for Infrastructure in accordance with Article 14(1) of the Roads (Northern 
Ireland) Order 1993 considers it expedient for the purpose of improving the trunk system that the 
road proposed to be constructed on the route described in Part I of the Schedule should be 
designated as trunk road. 
The Department in accordance with Article 68(4) of that Order proposes on completion of works 
providing alternative facilities for road traffic to— 
(a) stop-up the junctions described in Part II of the Schedule to road traffic; 
(b) stop-up the roads described in Part III of the Schedule to road traffic; 
(c) stop-up the roads described in Part IV of the Schedule to motor vehicles; and 
(d) abandon the length of road described in Part V of the Schedule. 
The Department makes the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 14(1) 
and 68(1), (3) and (5) of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993(a) and now vested in it (b). 
Notice of the proposed Order has been published, served and displayed in accordance with 
paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Schedule 8 to the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993. 
A total of 98 written representations were received in relation to the formal consultation period, 14 
of which were objections.  2 Objections were subsequently withdrawn.  The remaining 12 
objections were considered by the Department. 
The Department having caused a local inquiry to be held into the objections that were made and 
not withdrawn and having considered the report of the inquiry, now proposes to make the Order 
with modifications.  
                                                                                                                                            
(a) S.I. 1993/3160 (N.I. 15) to which there are no relevant amendments. 
(b) The functions of the Department of the Environment under the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993 were transferred to the 
Department for Regional Development by S.R. 1999 No. 481, article 6(d) and Schedule 4, Part IV. The Department for 
Regional Development was renamed the Department for Infrastructure by section 1(6) of the Departments Act (Northern

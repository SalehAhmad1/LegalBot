Interpretation
62N.—(1) In this Part of these Rules—
“the Act” means the Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019(1);
“business day” means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, Christmas Day, Good Friday or a day which is, or is to be observed as, a bank holiday in Northern Ireland under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971(2);
“chief clerk” means the chief clerk of the Court at the place where the proceedings under the Act are to be heard and includes such other civil servant in the Department of Justice as may be authorised to act on his behalf for the purpose in question; and
expressions which are defined in the Act have the same meaning as in the Act and a reference to a section is a reference to that section so numbered in the Act.
(2) A reference in this Part to a person affected by an order made under the Act includes a person by whom or on whose behalf there is stored any journalistic data specified or described in the application for that order.
Application for an overseas production order
62O.—(1) Subject to rule 62Q(7)(c), an application for an order under section 1 shall be made by giving notice in writing to the chief clerk which shall—

the person, or the description of person, to whom the applicant is seeking the Court to order that electronic data must be produced or made accessible; and

explain the grounds for believing that the electronic data sought does not consist of or include excepted electronic data;

explain the grounds for believing that the respondent has possession or control of all or part of the electronic data sought;

explain the grounds for believing that it is in the public interest for the respondent to produce or give access to the electronic data sought, having regard to—
(i)
the benefit likely to accrue to the investigation, or to the proceedings (as the case may be), if that data is obtained; and
(ii)

explain why such a requirement would be appropriate; and

(4) In the event that an overseas production order is made, the applicant shall as soon as practicable serve the order on the Secretary of State for service on the respondent.
(5) Where notice of the application was served on a respondent, in the event that the application is dismissed or abandoned, the applicant shall—
(a)
as soon as reasonably practicable so notify that respondent; and
(b)
where the application is dismissed, as soon as reasonably practicable notify that respondent if the Court nonetheless orders that for a period that respondent must not—

disclose the making of the application or its contents to any person.

in the absence of—

it appears to the Court that—

the Court is satisfied that—

the applicant cannot identify or contact the absentee;

(5) The Court shall not make, vary or revoke an order unless the applicant states, in an affidavit or orally, that to the best of the applicant’s knowledge and belief—
(a)
the application discloses all information which is material; and

the content of the application is true.

shorten or extend (whether before or after it has expired) a time limit under this Part;

subject to section 12(3) and (4) dispense with a requirement for service under this Part (whether before or after service was required); and

consider an application for an order or to vary, further vary or revoke an order orally instead of in writing.

(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Crown Court Rules (Northern Ireland) 1979 (S.R. 1979 No. 90) to—
take account of The Crime (Overseas Production Orders) Act 2019 (2019 c. 5) which enables law enforcement agencies and prosecutors to apply to the courts of the United Kingdom for a court order requiring service providers outside the UK to produce or grant access to electronic data for the purposes of investigating and prosecuting serious crimes. The Rules prescribe procedural matters relating to such applications; and
insert rules relating to hearing evidence by telephone under The Crime (International Co- Operation) Act 2003 (2003 c. 32).

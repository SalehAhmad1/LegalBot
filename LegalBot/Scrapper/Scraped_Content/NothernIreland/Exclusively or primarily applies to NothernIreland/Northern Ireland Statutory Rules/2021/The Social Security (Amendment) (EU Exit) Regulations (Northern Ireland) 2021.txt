(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Social Security (Immigration and Asylum) Consequential Amendments Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 (S.R. 2000 No. 71) (“the Immigration Regulations”) to reflect the United Kingdom’s transition to trade and continuity agreements (“TCAs”) to replace Association Agreements concluded with third countries under Article 217 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which provide for equal treatment, as a consequence of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.
Regulation 1 provides for citation, commencement, interpretation and effect.
Regulation 2(2) amends regulation 2 of the Immigration Regulations to remove paragraph 4 of Part I of the Schedule as a relevant provision for persons making a claim for universal credit. Paragraph 4 continues to provide that lawfully present nationals of states which have ratified the European Convention on Social and Medical Assistance or the Council of Europe Social Charter are not treated as being subject to immigration control for the purposes of the benefits specified in regulation 2(1) of the Immigration Regulations.
Regulation 2(3)(a) revokes paragraph 2(a) of Part II of the Schedule to the Immigration Regulations to provide that where an Association Agreement has not been transitioned to a TCA, nationals of that country who are lawfully working will only be treated as not being subject to immigration control for the purposes of the benefits specified in regulation 2(2) of the Immigration Regulations where that person has made a claim for that benefit before 28th October 2021. Regulation 2(3)(b) makes a consequential amendment.

16th December 2021EXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulation 2 of these Regulations amends the Statutory Sick Pay (Medical Evidence) Regulations Northern Ireland) 1985 to provide that an employee shall not be required to provide medical information in respect of the first 28 days of any spell of incapacity for work. Regulation 2(2) limits the application of this modification to spells of incapacity for work which either start during the period 17th December to 26th January or which commence prior to the Regulations coming into operation but which have not lasted more than 7 days on that date (and hence the requirement to provide medical evidence has not yet arisen).
These Regulations make, in relation to Northern Ireland, only provision corresponding to provision in regulations made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in relation to Great Britain and accordingly, by virtue of section 149(3) of, and paragraph 10 of Schedule 5 to, the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c. 8), are not subject to the requirement of section 149(2) of that Act for prior reference to the Social Security Advisory Committee.
No regulatory impact assessment has been produced for these Regulations as it makes provision which is to have effect for a period of less than 12 months.

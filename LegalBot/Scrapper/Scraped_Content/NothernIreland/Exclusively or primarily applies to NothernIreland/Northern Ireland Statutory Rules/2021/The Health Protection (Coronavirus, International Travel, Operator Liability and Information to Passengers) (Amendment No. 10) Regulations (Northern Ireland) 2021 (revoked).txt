(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend The Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (“the principal Regulations”) and the Health Protection (Coronavirus, International Travel, Operator Liability and Information to Passengers) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2021 (“the Operator Liability Regulations”).
Regulation 4 deals with the testing regime for eligible non-red list arrivals, i.e. those arrivals to Northern Ireland who are fully vaccinated upon arrival. There is no longer the option to take a day 2 lateral flow device (LFD) test followed by a confirmatory PCR test. Day 2 tests must all be PCR tests.
Regulation 5 deals with the self-isolation regime for eligible non-red list arrivals. They must now enter into self-isolation upon arrival. They must remain in self-isolation until they do a day 2 test and the result is negative.
Regulation 6 updates the information that must be given to passengers travelling to Northern Ireland.
No impact assessment has been prepared for these Regulations.

(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations are made in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively and other deficiencies, in particular deficiencies under paragraphs (c) to (ea) of section 8(2) and paragraph (a) of section 8(3) of European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16), arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
These Regulations make amendments to domestic legislation, specifically the Social Fund Maternity and Funeral Expenses (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 (S.R. 2005 No. 506) (the “Social Fund Regulations”), to reflect that the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State of the European Union. This is so that persons who fall within regulation 7(10) of the Social Fund Regulations continue to satisfy the condition in regulation 7(9) of those Regulations if the funeral takes place in the United Kingdom.

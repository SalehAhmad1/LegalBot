Article 4 makes corresponding amendments to enforcement provisions and Articles 5 and 6 make corresponding amendments to remedies provisions in the Principal Order.
Article 7 is a transitional and saving provision in respect of the repeal of Article 68(1)(d) and (e) and the insertion of the new Article 68(1A).

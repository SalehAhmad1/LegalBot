These Regulations amend the Civil Legal Services (Financial) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2015 (“the Financial Regulations 2015”). The purpose of these amending Regulations is to exempt certain applications for advice and assistance in potential proceedings or representation in certain proceedings or potential proceedings before the Review Panel, under the Mental Capacity Act (Northern Ireland) 2016, from financial eligibility assessments.
Regulation 2 substitutes regulation 4(1)(c) of the Financial Regulations 2015. The substituted regulation 4(1)(c) now refers to the Review Tribunal in place of the Mental Health Review Tribunal for Northern Ireland.
It adds applications to the Review Tribunal under section 45, references to the Tribunal under sections 47 and 48, applications to the Tribunal for the appointment of a nominated person where the client is the person to whom the application relates under section 80 and applications to the Tribunal for revocation of a Tribunal’s appointment where the client regains capacity under section 83(2), of the Mental Capacity Act (Northern Ireland) 2016, to the list of civil legal services that are available without reference to a client’s financial resources.
The Regulations come into operation on 2 December 2019.

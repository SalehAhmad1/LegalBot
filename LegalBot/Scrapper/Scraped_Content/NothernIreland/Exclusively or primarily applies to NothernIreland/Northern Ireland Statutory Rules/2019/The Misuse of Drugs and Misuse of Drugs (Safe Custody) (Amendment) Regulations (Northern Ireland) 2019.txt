(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Misuse of Drugs Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002 (S.R. 2002 No.2) (the “2002 Regulations”) and the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 1973 (S.R. & O. (N.I.) 1973 No. 179) (the “1973 Regulations”).
Regulation 2 adds the compounds known as pregabalin and gabapentin (and their salts and esters) to Schedule 3 to the 2002 Regulations. The Schedule to the Regulations in which a controlled drug is placed affects the extent to which the drug can be lawfully imported, exported, produced, supplied or possessed and dictates the record keeping, labelling and destruction requirements in relation to that drug.
Regulation 3 inserts pregabalin and gabapentin (and their salts and esters) into the list of exempted drugs in Schedule 1 to the 1973 Regulations. These compounds are consequently exempted from the safe custody requirements of those Regulations.

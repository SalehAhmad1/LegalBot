(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order corresponds to an Order (S.I. 2019/376) made by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions under section 148 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. It directs that the earnings factors relevant to the calculation of additional pension in any long-term benefit (in practice, now relevant only to the calculation of inherited additional pension), or of any guaranteed minimum pension, or to any other calculation required under Part III of the Pension Schemes (Northern Ireland) Act 1993 are to be increased for the tax years specified in the Schedule to this Order by the percentage of their amount specified in that Schedule. This is to ensure that earnings factors for those years are revalued at 2018-2019 earnings levels.
The percentages for the tax years from and including 2000-2001 are also relevant for the purpose of revaluing state scheme pension debits and credits in accordance with sections 13 and 14 of, and paragraphs 2(6) of Schedule 8 and 2(6) of Schedule 10 to, the Pensions Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 (c.5 (N.I.)). The percentage specified for 2015-2016 is used to increase flat rate accrual amounts of additional pension in accordance with paragraphs 4(2), 8(4) and 9(4) of Schedule 4B to the Social Security Contributions and Benefits (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (“the 1992 Act”).
This Order also provides for the rounding of fractional amounts for earnings factors relevant to the calculation of the additional pension in the rate of any long-term benefit. Rounding for the purpose of the calculation of any guaranteed minimum pension is not required by virtue of section 23(2) of the 1992 Act.

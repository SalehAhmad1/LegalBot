(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Personal Independence Payment (Transitional Provisions) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 227) (“the Transitional Regulations”) which make provision for disability living allowance (“DLA”) claimants to transfer to personal independence payment (“PIP”), including those who claim PIP after reaching the relevant age (age 65 or state pension age, whichever is the higher).
Regulation 2 inserts a new provision, regulation 27A, into the Transitional Regulations to correct an unintended gap in the legislation. This provides former DLA claimants, who are now in receipt of PIP and who transferred to PIP when they reached the relevant age or over, with an exemption to the upper age restriction in Article 88(1) of the Welfare Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 2015 (S.I. 2015/2006 (N.I. 1)) where their PIP award is revised or superseded for a change of circumstances. It also provides that a PIP award which is superseded for such claimants will be subject to the restrictions that apply to the mobility component for those of the relevant age or over under regulation 27(2) and (3) of the Personal Independence Payment Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 217).
Regulation 2 also applies these provisions to those in receipt of concessionary payments made in lieu of an award of the daily living component, mobility component or both components of PIP.
A full impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

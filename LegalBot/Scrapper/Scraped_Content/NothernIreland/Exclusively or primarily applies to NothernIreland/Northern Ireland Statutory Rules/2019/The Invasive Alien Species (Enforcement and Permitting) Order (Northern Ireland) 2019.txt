Coming into operation
1st December 2019
The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, being a Department designated(1) for the purposes of section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972(2) in relation to the environment, makes this Order in exercise of the powers conferred by that section of, and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to, that Act(3) and by Article 28(5) of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985(4). In accordance with Article 29(3) of that Order, the Department has consulted the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside(5) and has given to district councils and other persons affected an opportunity to submit objections or representations with respect to the subject-matter of this Order.
This Order makes provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and it appears to the Department that it is expedient for the references to the list of invasive alien species of European Union concern, adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species(6), to be construed as references to that list as amended from time to time.

(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order gives effect to Regulation (EU) No. 1143/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species therein (OJ L31/35, 4.11.2014)(“the Principal Regulation”) and of Commission Implementation Regulation (EU) No. 2016/1141 (OJ L189/4, 14.7.2016) adopting a list of invasive alien species of Union concern pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 1143/2014.
This Order provide for criminal offences relating to breach of requirements of the Principal Regulation.
Part 2 of the Order contains criminal offences. Parts 3 and 4 contain defences to those offences and penalties respectively. Part 5 sets out the enforcement provisions. In particular Articles 22 to 24 provide for enforcement notices which allow the Department to serve on the occupier or, where a different person, the owner, or both who has caused or permitted, whether knowingly or otherwise, a species on the Union list to be present on their premises. This Order will be enforced by the Department and authorised persons.
Part 6, provides for the issue of permits (Article 28) in accordance with Articles 8 and 9 of the Principal Regulation. Part 7 contains licencing provisions, which may be issued for a number of different activities, provided specific conditions are met (Article 29).
Part 8 contains provisions ensuring that the Order works alongside related legislation and avoids duplication of controls between similar regimes where possible. Article 32 makes amendments to Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 9 to the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985.
An impact assessment has not been produced for this instrument as no impact on the private, voluntary or public sectors is foreseen.

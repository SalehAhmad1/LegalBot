(This note is not part of the Regulations)
The Recovery of Health Services Charges (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 provides for a scheme for the recovery of charges in cases where an injured person who receives a compensation payment in respect of his injury has received hospital treatment or ambulance services. The charges are specified in certificates issued by the Department for Communities and are payable by persons who pay compensation to the injured person. The charges in each case are calculated by reference to a tariff of charges provided for by the Recovery of Health Services Charges (Amounts) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 (“the principal Regulations”).
Amendments made to the principal Regulations by regulation 2 increase the charges in respect of injuries which occur on or after 1st April 2019. Where the injured person is provided with health care ambulance services, the charge is increased from £208 to £219 for each occasion. Where the injured person receives health care treatment, but is not admitted to hospital the charge is increased from £688 to £725. The daily charge for health care in-patient treatment is increased from £846 to £891. The maximum charge in respect of an injury is increased from £50,561 to £53,278.
Regulation 3 is a saving provision which maintains the current charges for incidents occurring before 1st April 2019.

FOOD
The Food Safety (Information and Compositional Requirements) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2019
Made
29th January 2019
Coming into operation
22nd February 2019
The Department of Health M1 makes the following Regulations in exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 16(1) and (2), 25(1) and (3) and 47(2)(b) of the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 M2 and paragraph 1A of Schedule 2 to the European Communities Act 1972 M3.
These Regulations make provision for a purpose mentioned in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, and it appears to the Department of Health that it is expedient for references to provisions of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/128 M4 to be construed as a reference to those provisions as amended from time to time.
In accordance with Article 47(3A) of the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991, the Department of Health has had regard to relevant advice given by the Food Standards Agency.
As required by Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 M5 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety there has been open and transparent public consultation during the preparation and evaluation of these Regulations.

Department of HealthEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations make provision to enforce in Northern Ireland Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/128 supplementing Regulation (EU) No. 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the specific information and compositional requirements for food for special medical purposes (“the Delegated Regulation”). They do this by amending the Food Safety (Information and Compositional Requirements Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2016 (S.R. 2016 No. 251) (“the 2016 Regulations”), which make provision to enforce the requirements of Regulation (EU) No. 609/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provisions of food intended for infants and young children, food for special medical purposes, and total diet replacement for weight control (“the EU Regulation”). The EU Regulation sets out the general information and compositional requirements for certain categories of food and the 2016 Regulations provide for the enforcement of those requirements by applying, with modifications, certain provisions of the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991. The Delegated Regulation sets out the specific information and compositional requirements for food for special medical purposes.
Regulation 4 amends the 2016 Regulations so that specified provisions of the Delegated Regulation become ‘specified EU requirements’, to which the modified provisions of the Food Safety (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 apply. This enables an improvement notice to be served requiring compliance. Failure to comply with an improvement notice is a criminal offence.
References to the provisions of the Delegated Regulation are to be read as references to those provisions as amended from time to time.
A definition of food for medical purposes is contained in the EU Regulation and this expressly includes such foods for infants. From 22 February 2019 the Delegated Regulation applies only to food for special medical purposes other than that developed to satisfy the nutritional needs of infants. Regulation 3(2)(b) therefore ensures that enforcement of the Delegated Regulation is similarly limited. Regulation 5 amends the definition of medical food in the Medical Food Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 (S.R. 2000 No. 187) (“the 2000 Regulations”) which will continue to apply only to medical food developed to satisfy the nutritional needs of infants, so that they only apply to such food.
Regulation 3(3) includes transitional provisions for medical foods that are labelled or placed on the market before 22 February 2019. Such food may continue to be marketed until stocks are exhausted as long as they are sold in compliance with the specified requirements of the EU Regulation and regulation 3(1) and (2) of the 2000 Regulations.
A full impact assessment has not been published for this instrument as no, or no significant, impact on the private, voluntary or public sector is foreseen.

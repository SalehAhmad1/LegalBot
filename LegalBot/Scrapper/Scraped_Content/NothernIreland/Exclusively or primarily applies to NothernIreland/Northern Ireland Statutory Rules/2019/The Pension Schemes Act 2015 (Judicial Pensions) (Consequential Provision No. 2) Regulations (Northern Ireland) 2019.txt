(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations revoke and re-enact the Pension Schemes Act 2015 (Judicial Pensions) (Consequential Provision) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2019 which would otherwise cease to have effect by virtue of section 85(3)(b) of the Pension Schemes Act 2015. The Regulations make a consequential amendment to section 31 of the Public Service Pensions Act (Northern Ireland) 2014 (“the 2014 Act”) following the enactment of section 18A of the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993 (“the 1993 Act”). Section 18A of the 1993 Act enables the creation of a pension scheme for certain fee-paid judges including, in particular, making provision corresponding or similar to that made by or under Part 1 or section 20 of, or Schedule 2 or 2A to, the 1993 Act for salaried judges. Section 18A of the 1993 Act was inserted by section 78 of the Pension Schemes Act 2015. This amendment will ensure that the relationship between the 2014 Act and a scheme created under section 18A of the 1993 Act will be the same as the relationship between the 2014 Act and other judicial pension schemes established by or under the 1993 Act.

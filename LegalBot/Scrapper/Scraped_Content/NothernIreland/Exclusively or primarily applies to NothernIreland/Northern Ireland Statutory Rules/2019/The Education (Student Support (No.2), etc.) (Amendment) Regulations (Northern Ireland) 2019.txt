(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Education (Student Support) (No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 (S.R. 2009 No. 373)) (“the Student Support Regulations”), the Student Fees (Qualifying Courses and Persons) Regulations 2007 (S.R. 2007 No. 328), (“the QCP Regulations”) and the Education (Student Loans) (Repayment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 (S.R. 2009/128) (“the Repayment Regulations”).
The principal amendments which these Regulations make to the Student Support Regulations are as follows.
Regulation 3 amends regulation 2(1) of the Student Support Regulations to include definitions connected with the higher education regulatory regime established in England by the Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (“HERA”). Amongst these are definitions of “the register”, “registered”, “approved” and “approved (fee cap)” providers. Regulation 3(b) also partially amends the definition of “accelerated course” in line with the definition set out in paragraph 4(2) of Schedule 2 to HERA, and adds to the general interpretation section the definition of an “accredited institution”, to reflect the wider availability of loans for school-centred initial teacher training courses.

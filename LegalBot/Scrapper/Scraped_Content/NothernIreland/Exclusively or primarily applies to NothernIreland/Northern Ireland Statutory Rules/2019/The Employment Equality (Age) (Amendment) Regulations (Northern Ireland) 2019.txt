(This note is not part of the Regulations)
These Regulations amend the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 (“the 2006 Regulations”).
Regulation 2(a) amends the 2006 Regulations so as to increase the maximum age at which an occupational pension scheme can reduce the rate of pension a pensioner member of the scheme is receiving from age 65 to the state pension age of that member. This is to allow pension schemes to continue to rely on the exception in the 2006 Regulations which enables schemes to reduce the member’s benefits by an amount not exceeding the relevant state retirement pension rate with effect from the date they reach their state pension age without infringing their age related equality obligations.
Regulation 2(b) amends the definition of “relevant state retirement pension rate”. The term was defined in accordance with the meaning given in paragraph 2(5) of Schedule 28 to the Finance Act 2004 (c. 12). Paragraph 2(5) was repealed by section 20(1) of the Finance Act 2016 (c. 24). The term was re-defined in the Registered Pension Schemes (Bridging Pensions) and Appointed Day Regulations 2016 (“the 2016 Regulations”). Regulation 2(b) updates the definition in the 2006 Regulations so it refers to the relevant part of the definition in the 2016 Regulations.
An assessment of the impact of these Regulations is detailed in a Regulatory Impact Assessment, a copy of which is laid in the Business Office and the Library of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Copies of the Assessment are available from the Department for Communities, Social Security Policy and Legislation Division, Level 8, Causeway Exchange, 1-7 Bedford Street, Belfast BT2 7EG or from the website: https://www.communities-ni.gov.uk/articles/pension-information.

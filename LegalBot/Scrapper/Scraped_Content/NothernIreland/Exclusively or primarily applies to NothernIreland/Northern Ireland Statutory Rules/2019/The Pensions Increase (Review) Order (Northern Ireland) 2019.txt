Department of FinanceEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
Under section 69 of the Social Security Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1975 (c.15), the Department of Finance has to provide, by Order, for the increase in the rates of public service pensions. The Pensions (Increase) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 (c.35) defines certain terms and sets out when the pension “begins” (the day after the last day of service in respect of which the pension is payable) and how the increase applies to lump sums.
The increase to be made in the rates of such pensions is the percentage (or in some circumstances a fraction of the percentage) by which the Department for Communities has, by direction under section 132 of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 (c.8), increased the sums which are the additional pensions in long-term benefits, namely the additional pension entitlements accruing to employees in respect of their earnings after 5th April 1978.
For pensions which began before 9th April 2018 the increase is 2.4 per cent.
For pensions which began on or after 9th April 2018 the increases (following the calculation set out in article 3) are as follows:—
Pensions Beginning Percentage Increase
09th April 2018 to 23rd April 2018 2.40%
24th April 2018 to 23rd May 2018 2.20%
24th May 2018 to 23rd June 2018 2.00%
24th June 2018 to 23rd July 2018 1.80%
24th July 2018 to 23rd August 2018 1.60%
24th August 2018 to 23rd September 2018 1.40%
24th September 2018 to 23rd October 2018 1.20%
24th October 2018 to 23rd November 2018 1.00%
24th November 2018 to 23rd December 2018 0.80%
24th December 2018 to 23rd January 2019 0.60%
24th January 2019 to 23rd February 2019 0.40%
24th February 2019 to 23rd March 2019 0.20%
Article 3 of the Order provides for increases on certain deferred lump sums which became payable on or after 9th April 2018 and before 8th April 2019.
The Order also makes provision for the amount by reference to which any increase in the rate of an official pension is to be calculated to be reduced by an amount equal to the rate of the guaranteed minimum pension entitlement deriving from the employment which gives rise to the official pension.

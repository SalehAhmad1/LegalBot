SCHEDULEEXPLANATORY NOTE
(This note is not part of the Order)
This Order makes provision for the modification of certain social security legislation, so as to give effect to the Convention on Social Security between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland in Dublin signed on 1st February 2019 (“the Convention”).
The Convention set out in the Schedule provides for existing reciprocal rights in the field of social security, provided under the Common Travel Area arrangements and the law of the European Union, to be protected in respect of British and Irish citizens (and certain family members and survivors) moving between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Order does not impose any costs on business, charities or the voluntary sector. A Tax Information and Impact Note has not been prepared for this instrument as it gives effect to previously announced policy.

(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Legal Aid for Crown Court Proceedings (Costs) Rules (Northern Ireland) 2005 which prescribe the remuneration for solicitors and counsel assigned under Articles 29 or 36(2) of the Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (Northern Ireland) Order 1981.
The Rules introduce new provision for the payment of a time-based fee in respect of Referral Hearings in the Crown Court. The particular fee paid will depend on the representative, including the category of counsel instructed, as applicable, and on the duration of the hearing.
Referral Hearings occur when a Court has imposed a financial penalty, the person liable to pay the penalty is in default and that person’s case has been referred back to the Court responsible for enforcing payment. At the Referral Hearing, the Court will consider the exercise of its powers under section 9 of the Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 2016.

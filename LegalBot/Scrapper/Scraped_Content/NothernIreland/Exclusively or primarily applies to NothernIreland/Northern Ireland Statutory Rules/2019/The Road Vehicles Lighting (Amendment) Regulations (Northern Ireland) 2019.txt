These Regulations amend the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 to remove the requirement to illuminate the trailer registration plate.
The amendment is required as a consequence of the Trailer Registration Scheme which was introduced by the Trailer Registration Regulations 2018 (S.I. 2018/1203).

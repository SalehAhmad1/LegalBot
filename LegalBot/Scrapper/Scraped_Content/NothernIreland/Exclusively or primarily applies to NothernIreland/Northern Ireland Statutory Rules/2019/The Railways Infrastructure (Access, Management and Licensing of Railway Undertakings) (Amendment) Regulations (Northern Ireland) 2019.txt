functions to a different entity, provided the latter is not a railway undertaking, does not control a railway undertaking, or is not controlled by a railway undertaking;
(b)
the execution of works and related tasks on development, maintenance and renewal of the railway infrastructure to railway undertakings or companies which control the railway undertaking, or are controlled by the railway undertaking.

(a)
clearly separated from debts attributed to other legal entities within vertically integrated undertakings, and

(7) Within vertically integrated undertakings, the infrastructure manager must keep detailed records of any commercial and financial relations with the other legal entities within that undertaking.
(8) In vertically integrated undertakings, the accounts of the infrastructure manager and of the other legal entities must be kept in a way that ensures fulfilment of the requirements of this regulation and allows for separate accounting and transparent financial circuits within the undertaking.

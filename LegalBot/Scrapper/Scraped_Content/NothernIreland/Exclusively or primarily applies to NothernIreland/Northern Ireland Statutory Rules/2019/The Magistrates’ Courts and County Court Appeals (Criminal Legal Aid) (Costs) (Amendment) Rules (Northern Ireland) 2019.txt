(This note is not part of the Rules)
These Rules amend the Magistrates’ Courts and County Courts Appeals (Criminal Legal Aid) (Costs) Rules (Northern Ireland) 2009 which prescribe the remuneration for solicitors and counsel assigned under Articles 28, 28A or 30 of the Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (Northern Ireland) Order 1981.
The Rules introduce provision for the payment of a fixed fee in respect of Referral Hearings in the magistrates’ courts. Referral Hearings occur when a court has imposed a financial penalty, the person liable to pay the penalty is in default and that person’s case has been referred back to the court responsible for enforcing payment of the penalty. At the Referral Hearing, the court will consider the exercise of its powers under section 9 of the Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 2016.

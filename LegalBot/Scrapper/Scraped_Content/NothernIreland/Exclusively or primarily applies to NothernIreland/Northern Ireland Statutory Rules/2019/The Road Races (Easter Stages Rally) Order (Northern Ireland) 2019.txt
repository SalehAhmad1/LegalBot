(This note is not part of the Order) 
This Order permits the Ulster Automobile Club Limited, as promoter of the Easter Stages Rally

and during the times specified in the schedules. 
In effect this Order temporarily closes these roads. 
This Order requires the promoter to give public notice of the promoter’s intended use of these

by publishing advertisements in 2 local newspapers.  The promoter must also provide marshals, 
seal off the roads and arrange insurance to cover death, bodily injury or loss or damage to property 
resulting from the event. 
It is an offence for any person— 
(a) to obstruct or interfere wilfully and unlawfully with the conduct of the event; 
(b) to obstruct any constable acting in the course of that constable’s duty or any marshal or 
any other person exercising any function conferred on that person; 
(c) to enter or remain without authority on any road closed for the event; 
(d) to keep any animal or any vehicle without lawful authority on any specified road; or 
(e) to contravene wilfully any provision of a road closing Order or any traffic direction given 
by the police for the purposes of the event.

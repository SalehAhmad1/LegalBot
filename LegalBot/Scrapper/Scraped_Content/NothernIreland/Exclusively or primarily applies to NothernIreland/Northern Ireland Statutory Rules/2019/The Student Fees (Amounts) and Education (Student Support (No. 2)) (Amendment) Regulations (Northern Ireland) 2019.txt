(This note is not part of the Regulations)
Regulations 2 to 4 of these regulations amend the Student Fees (Amounts) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2005 (“the 2005 Regulations”) by increasing the basic and higher amounts prescribed in the 2005 Regulations. In each case the increases are by 2.9%, and will come into operation on 1st September 2020.
The 2005 Regulations prescribe the basic and higher amounts which higher education institutions in Northern Ireland may charge by way of tuition fees. Regulation 3 of the 2005 Regulations sets out the basic and higher amounts which ordinarily apply. Regulation 4 of the 2005 Regulations sets out the lower basic and higher amounts which apply in respect of an academic year of specified courses.
Regulations 5 to 9 of these regulations make amendments to the Education (Student Support) (No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009. These amendments correct course eligibility criteria which had been inserted in error by The Education (Student Support (No.2), etc.) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2019. Regulations 5 to 9 come into operation on 31st May 2019.

(This note is not part of the Order)
These Regulations, which extend to Northern Ireland only, revoke and replace the Plant Health (Import Inspection Fees) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2005 (S.R. 2005/373) and the Plant Health (Import Inspection Fees) (Wood and Bark) Regulations (S.R. 2005/380). The Regulations set out fees to cover the costs of documentary, identity and plant health checks of certain imports of plants, plant products and other objects from third countries.
Schedule 1 of these Regulations sets out the import inspection fees for plant health checks.
Reduced rates of inspection apply to imports of certain low risk plants and plant products and fees are charged at a proportionately reduced rate. Schedule 2 sets out these reduced import inspection fees. The reduced rates of inspection are reviewed annually and the reduced fees in Schedule 2 adjusted accordingly.
Schedule 3 sets out the import inspection fees for isolated bark and wood.
Schedule 4 sets out reduced import inspection fees for isolated bark and wood. The reduced rates of inspection are reviewed annually and the reduced fees in Schedule 4 adjusted accordingly.
Schedule 5 sets out the import inspection fees for documentary checks and identity checks.
Different types of plants, plant products and other objects contained within the same consignment shall be treated as separate consignments and are subject to separate fees (regulation 5).
An importer must provide certain information concerning the consignment at least 3 working days before it is landed in Northern Ireland (regulation 6).
Regulation 7 sets out the consequences of the failure to pay any fee.
An impact assessment has not been produced for these Regulations as no impact on business or the private or voluntary sectors is foreseen.

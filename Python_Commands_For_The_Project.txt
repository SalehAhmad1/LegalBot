If you are going to use Ollama as your LLM, make sure you have Ollama installed using:
pip install ollama

and, after doing so, you have to pull the model so it downloads on your system. How to do that?:
ollama pull "model name" for example
ollama pull llama3.1
You can find the model catalogue at: https://ollama.com/library

Rest, no changes needed in the code
